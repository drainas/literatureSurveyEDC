        <tr id="Introduction Cancer is an evolutionary process in which the stepwise accumulation of genetic alterations is shaped by Darwinian selection. As a result, each tumour is composed of a complex mixture of clonal cell subpopulations containing a partially overlapping, but distinct, pattern of driver and passenger mutations. Such intratumor heterogeneity has dramatic consequences, not only for cancer progression and metastatic spread, but also for resistance to therapy. We recently devised a novel approach based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology to recapitulate and trace the emergence of a new mutation in a subset of cancer cells, thus enabling functional studies on a gene of interest in a context that mimics intratumor heterogeneity. Material and methods We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to insert a potentially functional modification in the sequence of a gene of interest, coupled to a series of silent point mutations, serving as a genetic label for cell tracing. Because of HDR low efficiency, the modified allele can be introduced only in a small fraction of cells, thus mimicking the emergence of new mutant clones within a cancer mass population. In parallel, a second barcode, consisting of different silent mutations, was used as an internal control for possible CRISPR off-target cleavage. After exposing the cells to a given selective condition, the effects of the mutation of interest can be analysed by measuring the proportion of each barcode in genomic DNA by real-time quantitative PCR or deep sequencing. Results and discussions We used this CRISPR-barcoding strategy to model different mechanisms of non-small-cell lung cancer resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and we established a multiplex system to evaluate the efficacy of combined drug therapies aimed at preventing or delaying the emergence of resistant cells. Through a similar approach, we assessed the effects of repairing oncogenic driver mutations in addicted cancer cells directly at the genome level. Finally, we used a highly complex set of CRISPR-barcodes to trace intratumor heterogeneity, as a convenient alternative strategy to lentiviral barcode libraries. Conclusion CRISPR-barcoding is a fast and highly flexible means to investigate the effects of different kinds of genomic modifications in a broad range of functional assays.">

 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a complex disease with varying pathological subtypes including adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. After diagnosis, tumor staging provides important information about the extent of cancer in the body and anticipated response to treatment. NSCLC patients can have impaired immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to a progression of tumor growth and poorer prognosis. Accurate cell phenotyping combined with spatial profiling of the immune contexture and checkpoint expression, can provide a deeper understanding of complex cellular interactions underpinning the tumor-immune response. The aim of this study was to utilize spatial multiplexed imaging technology and associated data analysis methods to profile the immune contexture, as well as their spatial interactions with the tumor, in a set of tissue cores covering a range of NSCLC subtypes and tumor staging. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) NSCLC tissue microarrays (TMA), comprised of n=41 cores containing a range of carcinomas and pathological Tumor-Node-Metastasis (pTNM) stages (I-IV), were stained on a Leica Bond RX™ using the Akoya PhenoCode™ Signature Immuno-contexture Human Protein Panel, which includes markers for CD8, CD68, PD-1, PD-L1, FoxP3, and PanCK as a tumor indicator. Stained TMAs were scanned at 20x magnification on a PhenoImager HT multispectral imaging system. Image analysis was performed using Visiopharm software. Deep learning algorithms were applied to segment tumor and stroma regions of interest (ROI) and to accurately detect and classify specific cell phenotypes. Cell object data files per core were exported for spatial and neighborhood analysis using OracleBio’s proprietary python-based program, PhenoXplore. Immune cell counts, phenotypes and spatial interactions were generated within tumor and stroma ROI per core. Data included total and negative cell phenotype counts, cell density in tumor and stroma, as well as cell distance and neighborhood spatial interactions per core across NSCLC subtypes and stages in the TMA set. The combination of high-quality staining provided by the PhenoCode™ panel, coupled with deep learning quantitative phenotyping and spatial pattern analysis enables detailed characterization of the complex cellular interactions, at both the functional and spatial level, within the TME of NSCLC tissue. Data generated will support a greater understanding of the complex cellular interactions that can contribute to progression of NSCLC and may help guide future precision medicine strategies.

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, with its complexity driven by intricate and intertwined genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Despite advances in genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, understanding the phenotypic diversity of lung cancer has lagged behind. Next-generation phenomics, which integrates high-throughput phenotypic data with multiomics approaches and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), offers a transformative strategy for unraveling the complexity of lung cancer. This approach leverages advanced imaging, single-cell technologies, and AI to capture dynamic phenotypic variations at cellular, tissue, and whole organism levels and in ways resolved in temporal and spatial contexts. By mapping the high-throughput and spatially and temporally resolved phenotypic profiles onto molecular alterations, next-generation phenomics provides deeper insights into the tumor microenvironment, cancer heterogeneity, and drug efficacy, safety, and resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, integrating phenotypic data with genomic and proteomic networks allows for the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in ways informed by biological structure and function, fostering precision medicine in lung cancer treatment. This expert review examines and places into context the current advances in next-generation phenomics and its potential to redefine lung cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. It highlights the emerging role of AI and machine learning in analyzing complex phenotypic datasets, enabling personalized therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, next-generation phenomics holds the promise of bridging the gap between molecular alterations and clinical and population health outcomes, providing a holistic understanding of lung cancer biology that could revolutionize its management and improve patient survival rates.">

Clarifying the evolutionary histories, prevalence, and defining molecular features of these cells is essential for improving clinical outcomes, since intratumoral heterogeneity provides fuel for acquired resistance to targeted therapies. Here we present a statistically motivated strategy for deconstructing intratumoral heterogeneity through multiomic and multiscale analysis of serial tumor sections (MOMA). By combining deep sampling of IDH-mutant astrocytomas with integrative analysis of single-nucleotide variants, copy-number variants, and gene expression, we reconstruct and validate the phylogenies, spatial distributions, and transcriptional profiles of distinct malignant clones. By genotyping nuclei analyzed by single-nucleus RNA-seq for truncal mutations, we further show that commonly used algorithms for identifying cancer cells from single-cell transcriptomes may be inaccurate. We also demonstrate that correlating gene expression with tumor purity in bulk samples can reveal optimal markers of malignant cells and use this approach to identify a core set of genes that is consistently expressed by astrocytoma truncal clones, including AKR1C3, whose expression is associated with poor outcomes in several types of cancer. In summary, MOMA provides a robust and flexible strategy for precisely deconstructing intratumoral heterogeneity and clarifying the core molecular properties of distinct cellular populations in solid tumors.">

 Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) recapitulate intratumoral spatial heterogeneity and simulate a tumor microenvironment in which human immune and stromal cells in the PDX are replaced over passages by murine cells partially lacking immune function. Histological imaging enables exploring the spatial heterogeneity and dynamics of cancer, stromal, and immune cell interactions as correlates of tumor stage and therapeutic response over passages. We created a repository of curated, haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images as a community resource for addressing these questions.
 Images were generated at five sites within the NCI’s PDX Development and Trial Centers Research Network (PDXNet) and the NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository. Over 900 images, including 739 from PDXs and 190 from paired patients, are hosted on the Seven Bridges Genomics Cancer Genomics Cloud. They represent 42 cancer subtypes, including breast cancer (n=134), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD; n=94), pancreatic cancer (n=87), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD; n=80), melanoma (n=71), and squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC; n=65). Paired human/PDX images are available for each of these cancers. Human and/or PDX images generated following patient treatment are available for 37 of the subtypes. Most images are from early passages (P0: 158; P1: 292; P2: 152; P3: 69; >P3: 55). Annotations include sex, age, race, ethnicity, and, for most images, pathological assessment of tissue-level percent cancer, stromal, and necrotic cell content (n=639) and tumor stage (n=650). RNA and exome sequencing data are available for 99 and 228 images, respectively, matched at the patient or sample level.
 Quality control was performed using HistoQC. Cells were segmented and labeled as neoplastic, necrotic, immune, stromal, or other using Hover-Net and predictions of total neoplastic cell area correlated with whole-slide pathological assessment of cancer cell percentage (COAD: r=0.51; LUSC: r=0.59). HD-Staining, another classification approach, was applied to a subset of images and our clinical annotations will facilitate validation of this and related methods. Features of 512 x 512 pixel tiles were computed using the Inception V3 convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet. Unsupervised clustering of these features demonstrate inter-patient heterogeneity within pathologist-annotated tumor regions. A classifier developed using pathologist-annotated cancer, stromal, and necrotic regions and trained on the features in LUSC images (n=10 images) achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 96% for cancer tiles across (n=5) LUAD images. Accuracy was lower for stromal classification (90%), likely reflecting current limitations of our small, but growing, labeled training set.
 Our repository of clinically-annotated PDX H&E images should aid the community in studying spatial heterogeneity and in training deep learning-based image analysis methods.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Tumors contain cancerous cells with different mutations and different types of non-cancerous cells. It is important to understand the molecular properties of these cells in order to develop effective treatments for cancers. We describe a new strategy for studying tumor heterogeneity and apply it to human astrocytomas, a type of brain tumor. By slicing astrocytomas into a large number of serial sections and analyzing patterns of mutation frequencies, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer cell mutations in each tumor. By comparing these patterns to gene activity measured in the same sections, we identify molecular features that optimally distinguish different types of cancerous and non-cancerous cells and validate these with different techniques, including analysis of individual nuclei. By integrating analyses of multiple molecular species at multiple scales, our strategy provides a powerful approach for precisely deconstructing intratumoral heterogeneity. Abstract Tumors may contain billions of cells, including distinct malignant clones and nonmalignant cell types.

        <tr id="Many malignant cancers like glioblastoma are highly adaptive diseases that dynamically change their regional biology to survive and thrive under diverse microenvironmental and therapeutic pressures. While the concept of intra‐tumoral heterogeneity has become a major paradigm in cancer research and care, systematic approaches to assess and document bio‐variation in cancer are still in their infancy. Here we discuss existing approaches and challenges to documenting intra‐tumoral heterogeneity and emerging computational approaches that leverage artificial intelligence to begin to overcome these limitations. We propose how these emerging techniques can be coupled with a diversity of molecular tools to address intra‐tumoral heterogeneity more systematically in research and in practice, especially across larger specimens and longitudinal analyses. Systematic documentation and characterization of heterogeneity across entire tumor specimens and their longitudinal evolution has the potential to improve our understanding and treatment of cancer.">
