        <tr id="While cancer has traditionally been considered a genetic disease, mounting evidence indicates an important role for non-genetic (epigenetic) mechanisms. Common anti-cancer drugs have recently been observed to induce the adoption of reversible drug-tolerant cell states, thereby accelerating the evolution of drug resistance. Determining how to optimally balance the competing goals of killing the tumor bulk and delaying resistance evolution in this scenario is a nontrivial question of high clinical importance. In this work, we use a combined mathematical and computational approach to study optimal dosing of anti-cancer drug treatment under drug-induced cell plasticity. Our results show that the optimal treatment steers the tumor into a fixed equilibrium composition while balancing the trade-off between cell kill and tolerance induction in a precisely quantifiable way. Under linear induction of tolerance, a low-dose constant strategy is optimal in equilibrium, while under uniform induction of tolerance, alternating between a large dose and no dose is best. The directionality of drug induction, whether the drug elevates transitions from sensitivity to tolerance or inhibits transitions back, significantly affects optimal dosing. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we use it to identify an optimal low-dose strategy for colorectal cancer using publicly available in vitro data.">

        <tr id="Drug resistance inevitably emerges during the treatment of cancer by targeted therapy. Adaptive resistance is a major form of drug resistance, wherein the rewiring of protein signalling networks in response to drug perturbation allows the drug-targeted protein’s activity to recover, despite the continuous presence of the drug, enabling the cells to survive/grow. Simultaneously, molecular heterogeneity enables the selection of drug-resistant cancer clones that can survive an initial drug insult, proliferate, and eventually cause disease relapse. Despite their importance, the link between heterogeneity and adaptive resistance, specifically how heterogeneity influences protein signalling dynamics to drive adaptive resistance, remains poorly understood. Here, we have explored the relationship between heterogeneity, protein signalling dynamics and adaptive resistance through the development of a novel modelling technique coined Meta Dynamic Network (MDN) modelling. We use MDN modelling to characterise how heterogeneity influences the drug-response signalling dynamics of the proteins that regulate early cell cycle progression and demonstrate that heterogeneity can robustly facilitate adaptive resistance associated dynamics for key cell cycle regulators. We determined the influence of heterogeneity at the level of both protein interactions and protein expression and show that protein interactions are a much stronger driver of adaptive resistance. Owing to the mechanistic nature of the underpinning ODE framework, we then identified a full spectrum of subnetworks that drive adaptive resistance dynamics in the key early cell cycle regulators. Finally, we show that single-cell dynamic data supports the validity of our MDN modelling technique and a comparison between our predicted resistance mechanisms and known CDK4/6 and Estrogen Receptor inhibitor resistance mechanisms suggests MDN can be deployed to robustly predict network-level resistance mechanisms for novel drugs and additional protein signalling networks.">

        <tr id="Abstract Diverse forms of resistance to anticancer drugs can lead to the failure of chemotherapy. Drug resistance is one of the most intractable issues for successfully treating cancer in current clinical practice. Effective clinical approaches that could counter drug resistance by restoring the sensitivity of tumors to the targeted agents are urgently needed. As numerous experimental results on resistance mechanisms have been obtained and a mass of high-throughput data has been accumulated, mathematical modeling and computational predictions using systematic and quantitative approaches have become increasingly important, as they can potentially provide deeper insights into resistance mechanisms, generate novel hypotheses or suggest promising treatment strategies for future testing. In this review, we first briefly summarize the current progress of experimentally revealed resistance mechanisms of targeted therapy, including genetic mechanisms, epigenetic mechanisms, posttranslational mechanisms, cellular mechanisms, microenvironmental mechanisms and pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Subsequently, we list several currently available databases and Web-based tools related to drug sensitivity and resistance. Then, we focus primarily on introducing some state-of-the-art computational methods used in drug resistance studies, including mechanism-based mathematical modeling approaches (e.g. molecular dynamics simulation, kinetic model of molecular networks, ordinary differential equation model of cellular dynamics, stochastic model, partial differential equation model, agent-based model, pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic model, etc.) and data-driven prediction methods (e.g. omics data-based conventional screening approach for node biomarkers, static network approach for edge biomarkers and module biomarkers, dynamic network approach for dynamic network biomarkers and dynamic module network biomarkers, etc.). Finally, we discuss several further questions and future directions for the use of computational methods for studying drug resistance, including inferring drug-induced signaling networks, multiscale modeling, drug combinations and precision medicine.">

        <tr id="A growing body of experimental evidence indicates a strong link between intratumoral heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance in cancer. In particular, tumor cells may survive therapy by switching their phenotypic identities to more resistant, drug-tolerant states. Computational models of phenotypic plasticity in response to cytotoxic therapy are needed: (1) to strengthen understanding of the interplay between phenotypic heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance, and (2) to identify potential strategies in silico that weaken resistance prior to in vitro testing. This work presents a linear time-invariant model of phenotypic state dynamics to deduce subpopulation-level behavior likely to affect temporal phenotypic composition and thus drug resistance. The model was identified under different therapeutic conditions with authentic biological data from a breast cancer cell line. Subsequent analysis suggested drug-induced effects on phenotypic state switching that could not be deduced directly from empirical observations. A bootstrap algorithm was implemented to identify statistically significant results: reduction in cell division under each therapeutic condition versus control. Further, Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate quality of model fit for two-way switching and net switching on synthetically generated data to determine the limitations of the latter assumption for subsequent modeling. Most importantly, the simple model structure initiated a control-theoretic approach for identifying promising combination treatments in silico to guide future laboratory testing.">

        <tr id="Phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells can lead to complex cell state dynamics during tumor progression and acquired resistance. Highly plastic stem-like states may be inherently drug-resistant. Moreover, cell state dynamics in response to therapy allow a tumor to evade treatment. In both scenarios, quantifying plasticity is essential for identifying high-plasticity states or elucidating transition paths between states. Currently, methods to quantify plasticity tend to focus on 1) quantification of quasi-potential based on the underlying gene regulatory network dynamics of the system; or 2) inference of cell potency based on trajectory inference or lineage tracing in single-cell dynamics. Here, we explore both of these approaches and associated computational tools. We then discuss implications of each approach to plasticity metrics, and relevance to cancer treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Current personalized cancer medicine tailors therapy to heterogeneity between cancers of the same organ type occurring within different individuals. However, it does not yet address heterogeneity at the single cell level within individual cancers or the dynamics of cancer, due to heritable genetic and epigenetic change, as well as transient functional changes. We established computational methods for evaluating personalized medicine strategies, comparing the current personalized medicine strategy to alternatives. Current personalized medicine matches therapy to a tumor molecular profile at diagnosis and at tumor relapse or progression. This strategy focuses on the average, static, and current properties of the sample. Non-standard strategies also consider minor sub-clones, dynamics, and predicted future tumor states. Previous simulation results in a system with two non-cross resistant agents using non-standard strategies, optimized in single 45 day blocks, demonstrated significantly improved outcomes (Beckman, Schemmann, and Yeang, 109: 14586-91, 2012). The current work explores the effect of long range planning with a time horizon of up to five years on the effectiveness of the strategies, as well as generalizing the model to three non-cross resistant agents.. Methods: We developed a mathematical model of cancer therapy with two non-cross resistant agents incorporating genetic evolutionary dynamics and single cell heterogeneity, and examined simulated clinical outcomes (cell numbers of clones and sub-clones, projected survival). Previously we compared the current personalized medicine strategy to 5 alternative personalized strategies. The latter strategies explicitly considered sub-clones, evolutionary dynamics, and likely future sub-clones in addition to the current predominant clone. Particular emphasis was given to the prevention of incurable, multiply resistant sub-clones. The optimization was performed in single 45 day blocks. In the current work, we extended the work to three drug systems. We also extended the previous single step heuristic strategies to encompass multistep heuristics of up to five 45 day steps, and global optimization in 45 day blocks over a 5 year time horizon, with strategic updates every 45 days. Branch and bound methods were used for pruning decision trees. Parallel processing (23 servers) facilitated computations. Results: Previously we had carried out a computerized virtual clinical trial of over 3 million evaluable cancer “patients”, comparing current personalized medicine and 5 non-standard strategies. The 3 million virtual patients represented a comprehensive survey of likely population structures, growth rates, phenotypic transition rates (by heritable genetic or epigenetic mechanisms), and drug sensitivities. All alternatives tested resulted in an approximate doubling in mean and median survival compared to current personalized medicine and an increase in the apparent cure rate from 0.7% for current personalized medicine to 17-20% for alternatives. In no case was the current personalized medicine strategy superior. In the current work, we found in large simulations that planning ahead led to further increases in cure rates and analyzed several examples where highly complex treatment sequences led to cures which were not possible with single step 45 day optimization. Further, previous and current conclusions applied equally for three non-cross resistant agents. Conclusions: Explicit consideration of intratumoral heterogeneity and evolutionary dynamics, with probabilistic consideration of future outcomes with a long strategy horizon, can potentially lead to markedly improved patient outcomes, including cure rates. Application of knowledge from growing molecular and clinical oncology databases may allow more informative therapeutic simulations than previously possible. Citation Format: Robert A.
