        <tr id="Intratumoral variability is a seminal feature of human tumors contributing to tumor progression and response to treatment. Current technologies are unsuitable to accurately track phenotypes and subclonal evolution within tumors, especially in response to genetic manipulations. Here, we developed epitope combinatorial tags (EpicTags), which we coupled to multiplexed ion beam imaging (EpicMIBI) for in situ tracking of barcodes within tissue microenvironments. Using this platform, we dissected the spatial component of cell lineages and phenotypes in a xenograft model of small-cell lung cancer. We observed emergent properties from mixed clones leading to the preferential expansion of subclonal patches for both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cancer cell states in this model. In tumors harboring a fraction of PTEN-deficient cancer cells, we uncovered a non-autonomous increase of subclonal patch size in PTEN wildtype cancer cells. EpicMIBI can facilitate in situ interrogation of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic processes involved in intratumoral heterogeneity.">

        <tr id="We conducted a spatial analysis of stage III colorectal adenocarcinomas using Hyperion Imaging Mass Cytometry, examining 52 tumors to assess the tumor microenvironment at the single-cell level. This approach identified 10 distinct cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment, including stromal and immune cells, with a subset showing a proliferative phenotype. By focusing on spatial neighborhood interactions and tissue niches, particularly regions with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, we investigated how cellular organization relates to clinicopathological and molecular features such as microsatellite instability (MSI) and recurrence. We determined that microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers had an increased risk of recurrence if they had the following features: 1) a low level of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and 2) low interactions between CD4 + T cells and stromal cells. Our results point to the utility of spatial single-cell interaction analysis in defining novel features of the tumor immune microenvironments and providing useful clinical cell-related spatial biomarkers.">

        <tr id="Tumor microenvironments (TMEs) are spatially complex and dynamic systems shaped by evolutionary pressures, tissue architecture, and cellular interactions. To capture this complexity, we developed the Tumor Landscape Analysis (TLA) pipeline, a computational framework applying principles from landscape ecology and spatial statistics to quantitatively characterize tumor spatial heterogeneity. TLA integrates spatially resolved pathology data, including whole-cell, point-based, and region-level formats, and computes multiscale metrics to assess cell distributions, neighborhood relationships, and tissue-level organization. The framework leverages ecological indices such as the Morisita-Horn index, Ripley’s H function, and Shannon diversity to quantify intercellular proximity, spatial clustering, and cellular diversity. It also uses the concept of local microenvironments (LMEs), data-driven ecological niches defined by local cell-type abundance and spatial uniformity, enabling unsupervised and reproducible classification of tumor regions. The use of fragmentation metrics, including patch density, shape complexity, and interspersion, provide further insight into spatial disorganization and emergent tissue architecture. TLA is agnostic to imaging modality and biological context, supporting broad applicability across tumor types and sample formats. By translating complex tissue architectures into interpretable spatial metrics, the pipeline enables integrative analyses that link spatial ecology to clinical and molecular phenotypes. This approach facilitates a deeper understanding of how spatial features contribute to tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical outcomes, offering new opportunities for precision oncology rooted in spatial systems biology.">

        <tr id="Over the past years, cancer research has transitioned from a ‘cancer cell-centered’ focus to a more integrative view of tumors as dynamic ecosystems. This paradigm shift emphasizes the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a complex network of interacting cellular and acellular components, where tumor cells orchestrate a supportive environment that facilitates progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. Understanding the spatial organization of these components within the TME is crucial, as the positioning and interactions between cancerous and non-cancerous cells significantly influence tumor behavior and therapy response. Spatial proteomics has emerged as a powerful tool for TME analysis, enabling the detection and quantification of proteins within intact tissue architecture at subcellular resolution. This approach provides insights into cellular interactions, signaling pathways, and functional states, facilitating the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets linked to specific tissue regions and cellular contexts. Translating spatial proteomics into clinical practice requires overcoming challenges related to technology refinement, standardization of workflows, and adaptation to routine pathology settings. Melanoma is an aggressive, highly immunogenic malignancy with variable response rates to existing immunotherapies. Given that over half of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) fail to respond or experience disease progression, the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to enhance current therapies is urgently required. Spatial imaging technologies are increasingly being utilized to dissect the complex interplay between stroma, melanoma, and immune cell types within the TME to address this need. This review examines key spatial proteomics methods, their applications in melanoma biology, and associated image analysis pipelines. We highlight the current limitations, and future directions, emphasizing the potential for clinical translation to guide personalized treatment strategies, inform prognosis, and predict therapeutic response.">

        <tr id="Background Identification of the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) opened significant potential for understanding the tumor biology and intertumoral heterogeneity of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, molecular subtyping in CRC traditionally relies on bulk transcriptomics, therefore, lacks spatial and single-cell level aspect. Methods We constructed tissue microarrays using tumor cores from 222 CRC patients. Arrays were stained and imaged using 54 cell identity and cancer hallmark markers, delivering spatially resolved protein profiles of >2 million cells. RNA sequencing data and CMS classification were also available for these patients. After segmentation of cancer, stromal and immune cells, we investigated intratumoral heterogeneity within CMS subtypes using spatially resolved single-cell protein profiling (>2 million cells). We compared cell types, their spatial organization and their expression of cancer hallmark-related proteins in CMS 1-4 subtypes. Results We revealed tissue atlases illustrating the cell types/states, spatial heterogeneity, cellular neighborhoods, cellular network, and single-cell protein profiles of CMS tumors. CMS1 tumors had more CD3+, CD8+, and PD1+ immune cells that were found in the epithelial layer frequently. CMS1 was also associated with higher levels of metabolic reprogramming markers such as upregulated glycolysis. CMS2 showed immune segregation, reactive stroma patterns and higher levels of apoptotic and proliferative signaling proteins. CMS3 exhibited clustered cancer cells with high RIP3 levels, suggesting a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. CMS4 displayed stromal-centric and immune-evasive tumors characterized by decreased HLA-1 levels and regulatory T-cell exclusion from epithelium. Conclusion We present a spatial protein atlas of CRC at single-cell resolution and demonstrate novel aspects of CMS tumour structures.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, recently approved by the FDA for melanoma, is an emerging modality for cell-based immunotherapy. However, its application in immunologically “cold” tumors such as glioblastoma remains limited due to sparse T cell infiltration, antigenic heterogeneity, and a suppressive tumor microenvironment. To identify genomic and spatial determinants of TIL expandability, we performed integrated, multimodal profiling of high-grade gliomas using spectral flow cytometry, TCR sequencing, single-cell RNA-seq, Xenium in situ transcriptomics, and CODEX spatial proteomics. Comparative analysis of TIL-generating (TIL+) versus non-generating (TIL−) tumors revealed that IL7Rexpression, structured perivascular immune clustering, and tumor-intrinsic metabolic programs such as ACSS3 were associated with successful TIL expansion. In contrast, TIL−tumors were enriched for neuronal lineage signatures, immunosuppressive transcripts including TOX and FERMT1, and tumor-connected macrophages. This study defines spatial and molecular correlates of TIL manufacturing success and establishes a genomics-enabled selection platform for adoptive T cell therapy. The profiling approach is now being prospectively implemented in the GIANT clinical trial (NCT06816927), supporting its translational relevance and scalability across glioblastoma and other immune-excluded cancers.">

        <tr id="Abstract Motivation Spatial transcriptomic (ST) technologies, such as GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, are increasingly utilized to investigate the role of diverse tumor microenvironment components, particularly in relation to cancer progression, treatment response, and therapeutic resistance. However, in many ST studies, the spatial information obtained from immunofluorescence imaging is primarily used for identifying regions of interest (ROIs) rather than as an integral part of downstream transcriptomic data analysis and interpretation. Results We developed ROICellTrack, a deep learning-based framework that better integrates cellular imaging with spatial transcriptomic profiling. By analyzing 56 ROIs from urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and upper tract urothelial carcinoma, ROICellTrack identified distinct cancer–immune cell mixtures, characterized by specific transcriptomic and morphological signatures and receptor–ligand interactions linked to tumor content and immune infiltrations. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating imaging with transcriptomics to analyze spatial omics data, improving our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and its relevance to personalized and targeted therapies.

 Identifying the contribution and the role of each individual cell in the spatial context of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial in determining tumor progression, examining the extent of immune infiltration, and identifying potential therapeutic targets. While single-cell sequencing-based techniques help reveal cellular heterogeneity in a cell population, they do not provide spatial context. In turn, recently emerged spatial transcriptomics techniques are challenged by the difficulty in pinpointing the spatial measurement to single cells, requiring either complex cell segmentation or deconvolution algorithms in the data processing.
 To address these limitations, we introduce Curio Trekker single-cell spatial mapping kit, a unique platform that turns a single-cell experiment into a spatial experiment, essentially providing a spatial measurement that has true single-cell resolution. It is based on the Slide-tags methodology (Russel et al, 2023) that spatially tags each nucleus within its native tissue environment. This approach utilizes existing single-nuclei sequencing infrastructure to generate high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data. Using archived FFPE samples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Curio Trekker by aligning 25-30 µm tissue sections to spatially barcoded tiles. Spatial barcodes are cleaved and hybridized to cells and nuclei in the intact tissue, followed by tissue dissociation and nuclei isolation. The tagged nuclei are processed with established snRNA-seq workflows (e.g., 10x Chromium FLEX), producing gene expression and spatial libraries for the individual nuclei in the tissue section. This spatial tagging allows each nucleus to be bioinformatically mapped back to its original tissue location.
 We applied this solution to breast cancer biospecimens from different patients using whole transcriptome probes (10x Genomics). The resulting data allowed for detailed characterization of the TME, confidently identifying epithelial-malignant, stromal, and immune cells from each biospecimen. This enabled marker-guided regional selection and differential gene expression analysis based on both cell type and spatial location. Overall, the Curio Trekker platform provides a streamlined, high-resolution solution for profiling cellular heterogeneity and interactions within tumors, seamlessly integrating with existing workflows to generate rapid insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic development.

        <tr id="Drug delivery to solid tumors is challenged by multiple physiological barriers arising from the tumor microenvironment, including dense extracellular matrix, cellular heterogeneity, hypoxic gradients, and elevated interstitial fluid pressure. These features hinder the uniform distribution and accumulation of therapeutics, reducing treatment efficacy. Despite their widespread use, conventional two-dimensional monolayer cultures fail to reproduce these complexities, contributing to the poor translational predictability of many preclinical candidates. Three-dimensional multicellular tumor spheroids have emerged as more representative in vitro models that capture essential features of tumor architecture, stromal interactions, and microenvironmental resistance mechanisms. Spheroids exhibit spatially organized regions of proliferation, quiescence, and hypoxia, and can incorporate non-tumor cells to mimic tumor–stroma crosstalk. Advances in spheroid analysis now enable detailed evaluation of drug penetration, cellular migration, cytotoxic response, and molecular gradients using techniques such as optical and confocal imaging, large-particle flow cytometry, biochemical viability assays, and microfluidic integration. By combining physiological relevance with analytical accessibility, spheroid models support mechanistic studies of drug transport and efficacy under tumor-like conditions. Their adoption into routine preclinical workflows has the potential to improve translational accuracy while reducing reliance on animal models.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is notoriously resistant or refractory to both modern and conventional therapies. These tumors are characterized by heterogeneous malignant epithelial lesions and immune cells embedded within a highly dense and complex stroma. The unique, multi-compartmental tumor microenvironment (TME) —encompassing diverse lineages such as fibroblasts, mural cells, endothelial cells, lymphoid and myeloid populations, cancer cells, and a rich extracellular matrix—indicates the presence of intricate cellular networks that drive tumor progression. Efforts to profile and therapeutically target specific compartments or cellular phenotypes have often led to unintended adverse effects on neighboring cells and their microenvironments, compromising drug efficacy. To identify vulnerabilities in these interactions and precisely quantify intra- and inter-tumoral spatial heterogeneity, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing data from eight distinct datasets to design separate custom multiplexed histopathology panels for imaging mass cytometry against tumor, immune, and stromal targets. Three serial sections of a tissue microarray containing 4 cores from 221 patients on each were stained with compartment-specific panels. Cell segmentation and clustering of 7.9 million cells in our dataset revealed 104 unique cell types, their functional states along with biophysical responses. We identified the presence of multiple epithelial subtypes within a single patient, along with single-compartment cellular organization and phenotypes associated with patient outcomes. Advanced image alignment using pixel classification and image transformation across serial sections enabled integration of TME-wide information, defining reproducible microenvironments neighboring malignant ducts. These microenvironments demonstrated immune and stromal patterns closely associated with specific epithelial phenotypes, carrying significant prognostic implications. Laser capture microdissection combined with mass spectrometry provided deeper insights into the biological processes within our microenvironments. We further identified associations between our microenvironments with bulk-RNAseq and specific genomic aberrations. These findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of the TME in PDAC and highlight the therapeutic potential in addressing this complexity to overcome the challenges in treating patients with PDAC.

        <tr id="Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a heterogeneous population of stromal cells, which modulate the immune system and can have both pro‐ and anti‐tumorigenic effects. In classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), the role of CAFs has remained largely undefined. We applied multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging and spatial analysis on tumor samples from two independent cHL patient cohorts (n = 131 and n = 148) to study CAFs and their interactions with Hodgkin Reed–Sternberg (HRS) and tumor microenvironment (TME) cells at the single‐cell resolution. We show that higher proportions of CAFs are associated with favorable outcomes, independent of the clinical covariables. In contrast, a subset of CD45+ immune cells with strong fibroblast‐activation protein positivity, classified as macrophages, was less abundant in nodular sclerosis subtype and associated with worse outcomes. Neighborhood analysis allowed for the identification of colocalization or regional exclusion of phenotypically defined cell types and recurrent cellular neighborhoods. Despite the positive impact of CAF proportions on survival, patients with enrichment of platelet‐derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB)‐positive CAFs in the vicinity of HRS cells had worse survival in both cohorts, independent of the clinical determinants. Our findings distinguish various subsets of CAFs and macrophages impacting survival in cHL and underscore the importance of the spatial arrangements in the TME.">

 SCLC is the deadliest type of lung cancer, which is mostly diagnosed at late stages and accounts for 15% of pulmonary tumors. Chemotherapy is initially effective, but SCLC patients relapse quickly and develop resistant tumors. Large-scale studies uncovered key molecular patterns in SCLC, which include universal loss of TP53 and RB1, as well as transcriptional patterns based on the expression of 4 lineage transcription factors (TF). We aimed to dissect how genomic cues impact transcriptional phenotypes, and the dynamics of tumor and immune cell interactions, to thus decipher molecular mechanisms of phenotypic divergence in SCLC.
 We performed genome and single cell transcriptome profiling on 56 SCLC patient tumors, including primary tumors, metastases and paired relapse tumors, including a patient sample after treatment with DLL3-targeted immunotherapy. Single cell RNA-seq was performed with the 10x Genomics platform to study cancer cells and the tumor micro-environment (TME), and tumor cell intrinsic heterogeneity. Data were processed with an in-house pipeline.
 Single cell expression profiles were determined for > 200000 cells from 56 tumors. Transcriptome profiling at single cell levels revealed co-expression of at least two of the lineage TF ASCL1, NEUROD1 or POU2F3 for each SCLC tumor. Transcriptional profiles pointed to a marked intra- and interpatient, as well as to inter-metastatic heterogeneity. Cell-cell-interaction analysis across all samples uncovered recurrent patterns of intra-tumoral receptor-ligand interactions. The integrative analysis of genome and single cell transcriptome data pointed to somatic alterations and copy number alterations shaping transcriptional heterogeneity. Specifically, tumors with gene amplifications of MYC family members share similar expression profiles. We performed multi-regional and longitudinal studies of matched patient cases to project genomic patterns of clonal evolution to transcriptional profiles at single cell level, thus analyzing the effect of genome diversity on the transcriptional landscape. Additionally, tumor intrinsic profiles of heterogeneity were mapped to single cell data of patient tumors to elucidate the effects on tumor-immune cell interactions.
 Altogether we provide a first comprehensive framework for the study of underlying genetic alterations that shape the transcriptional landscape and phenotypic plasticity in SCLC. Our data points to a concerted regulation of a multitude of factors including lineage TF, transcriptional programs and interaction networks in SCLC.

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Bone metastasis is a frequent and life-threatening event in advanced cancers, affecting up to 70–85% of prostate cancer patients. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying bone metastasis is essential for developing targeted therapies. This study aimed to systematically characterize the heterogeneity and microenvironmental adaptation of prostate cancer bone metastases using single-cell transcriptomics. Methods: We integrated the largest single-cell transcriptome dataset to date, encompassing 124 samples from primary prostate tumors, various bone metastatic sites, and non-malignant tissues (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia, normal bone marrow). After quality control, 602,497 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes were analyzed. We employed unsupervised clustering, gene expression profiling, mutation analysis, and metabolic pathway reconstruction to characterize cancer cell subtypes and tumor microenvironmental remodeling. Results: Cancer epithelial cells dominated the tumor microenvironment but exhibited pronounced heterogeneity, posing challenges for conventional clustering methods. By integrating genetic and metabolic features, we revealed key evolutionary trajectories of epithelial cancer cells during metastasis. Notably, we identified a novel epithelial subpopulation, NEndoCs, characterized by unique differentiation patterns and distinct spatial distribution across metastatic niches. We also observed significant metabolic reprogramming and recurrent mutations linked to prostate-to-bone microenvironmental transitions. Conclusions: This study comprehensively elucidates the mutation patterns, metabolic reprogramming, and microenvironment adaptation mechanisms of bone metastasis in prostate cancer, providing key molecular targets and clinical strategies for the precise treatment of bone metastatic prostate cancer.">

 Multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) enables spatially resolved single-cell phenotyping within the tumor microenvironment (TME), which is being increasingly recognized as an important predictor of patient response to immunotherapies. MultiOmyxTM is a mIF platform provided by NeoGenomics Laboratories, Inc capable of detecting up to 60 proteins on a single formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue section, with an image-able area of 10 square centimeters. The platform enables profiling of millions of individual cells in a single slide, providing unbiased spatial phenotyping at scale.
 Here we present an improved NeoLYTXTM image analysis pipeline that has been optimized for whole-slide analysis. We demonstrate the pipeline’s capabilities using a 16-marker TME panel to spatially characterize a set of 20 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples. Accuracy is benchmarked against clinically validated immunohistochemistry (IHC) for a subset of representative immune phenotypes. Cell density and intensity data generated by the NeoLYTX pipeline demonstrated strong concordance with IHC assays for all markers evaluated.
 To achieve high throughput whole slide processing while maintaining high accuracy, we use an automated pipelined backed by 100% human quality control (QC). Automation begins with image acquisition, where QC algorithms monitor image collection in real-time to detect imaging failures and trigger corrective action. In post-processing, tissue and stain QC algorithms then identify regions of tissue artifacts such as tissue loss, tissue folding, and necrotic regions to be excluded from downstream analysis.
 We next transform our mIF images into a single-cell map of the TME by segmenting the tissue into spatial regions and phenotyping on a single cell level. Region segmentation delineates the tissue from surrounding glass, and then further segments the tissue into different regions such as intratumoral, stromal, vasculature, and leading-edge. Single cells and subcellular compartments are segmented and intensity is quantified over the relevant expression patterns of each marker. Cells are phenotyped using an in-house library of AI algorithms trained on millions of annotated cells - the models integrate morphological and intensity features to accurately distinguish target populations from artifacts and identify phenotypes across diverse tissue types and qualities.
 Finally, we demonstrate our comprehensive spatial profiling on the cohort of 20 NSCLC samples. Cell distributions are quantified through a combination of unsupervised neighborhood clustering, nearest neighbor distances, and tissue region profiling. By mapping critical cell populations—such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and other cellular signatures—across distinct tissue regions, we extract salient spatial information that provides biological insight into the TME.

 Prostate cancer (PCa) exhibits significant intratumoral heterogeneity, driving a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from indolent disease to aggressive metastasis, challenging risk stratification and treatment. A key feature of this heterogeneity is clonal diversity, encompassing both cancer cells and their interactions with the surrounding stromal microenvironment. Understanding clonal dynamics and stromal influences on tumor progression is crucial for identifying factors that contribute to metastasis and disease lethality, ultimately improving risk stratification and therapeutic strategies.



 We performed organ-wide spatial transcriptomic analyses (VisiumTM v2, 10x Genomics) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from ten patients with primary, nodal metastatic PCa and biopsy samples, recruited to a local trial (ISRCTN10046036). Two pathologists meticulously annotated each spot, including benign, Gleason grade, stroma, and immune cells. Fastq data were processed using SpaceRangerTM, and inferred clonal genomic identities were analyzed with SpatialInferCNV (https://github.com/aerickso/SpatialInferCNV). We reconstructed clonal evolution using phylogenetic trees and analyzed stromal gene expression around distinct tumor clones using differential expression analyses. In addition, we performed multiplex imaging on consecutive sections to assess protein expression and correlate it with gene expression data, enabling the identification of key tumor-stroma interactions associated with metastatic progression.



 We analyzed 122 spatial transcriptomics capture areas, collectively representing over 1, 000, 000 spots (55 µm diameter), or approximately 16, 000, 000 cells. We identified clonal subtypes across biopsy, primary and metastatic tissues, revealing distinct clonal relationships and polyclonal lymph node colonization at different evolutionary stages. Stromal cells around metastatic progenitor clones showed upregulation of antigen presentation and inflammatory pathway genes, contrasting with stromal profiles surrounding lethal clones (as defined by their ability to metastasize to lymph nodes). These findings suggest a dynamic interplay between tumor cells and their stroma, potentially influencing metastatic potential and immune evasion.



 This study provides a detailed cellular-level characterization of clonal heterogeneity in PCa and its relationship with stromal dynamics, offering insights into mechanisms driving metastatic progression. These insights could inform strategies for risk stratification and therapeutic intervention, including leveraging dual tumor-stromal profiles as biomarkers to distinguish lethal from indolent disease. Understanding the interplay between tumor clones and their stroma opens new avenues for targeted treatment approaches aimed at preventing metastasis and improving patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive and heterogeneous malignant tumors, presents significant challenges for clinical management due to its cellular and metabolic complexity. This review integrates recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to elucidate glioblastoma’s cellular heterogeneity and metabolic reprogramming. Diverse cellular subpopulations, including malignant proliferative cells, stem-like cells, mesenchymal-like cells, and immune-related cells, contribute to tumor progression, treatment resistance, and microenvironmental interactions. Spatial transcriptomics has further revealed distinct spatial distributions of these subpopulations, highlighting differences in metabolic activities between the tumor core and periphery. Key metabolic adaptations, such as enhanced glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and glutamine metabolism, play critical roles in supporting tumor growth, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance. Targeting these metabolic pathways, especially in combination with immunotherapy, represents a promising avenue for glioblastoma treatment. This review emphasizes the importance of integrating single-cell and spatial multi-omics technologies to decode glioblastoma’s metabolic landscape and explore novel therapeutic strategies. By addressing current challenges, such as metabolic redundancy and spatiotemporal dynamics, this work provides insights into advancing precision medicine for glioblastoma.">

This comprehensive approach facilitates the identification of PitNETs tumor populations and characterizes the reconfiguration of the tumor microenvironment (TME) as PitNETs progress and invade. We trace the trajectory of TPIT-lineage PitNETs and identify an aggressive tumor cluster marked by elevated p53-mediated proliferation and a higher Trouillas classification, both associated with tumor progression. Additionally, we document the heterogeneity of immune stromal cells within PitNETs, particularly noting the enrichment of SPP1+ tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in invasive tumors. These TAMs facilitate tumor invasion through the SPP1-ITGAV/ITGB1 signaling pathway. Our in-depth single-cell and spatial analysis of PitNETs uncovers the molecular dynamics within the TME, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention.">

 The spatial organization and cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME) has the potential to inform clinical and translational researchers about mechanisms of disease progression and therapeutic success. Of particular interest are immune cells, especially T cells, which can become exhausted due to chronic stimulation. This poses a significant challenge in cancer therapy as exhausted T cells have reduced effector functions and sustained expression of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, resulting in failure to effectively eliminate tumor cells.
 Imaging Mass Cytometry™ (IMC™) technology is a high-plex imaging technique that enables deep characterization of the heterogeneity and complexity of the TME. The Hyperion™ XTi Imaging System utilizes IMC technology to provide signal intensities over a wide dynamic range and entails one-step detection of 40-plus markers without issues of tissue autofluorescence, making it ideally suited for spatial biology applications. Whole slide imaging modes and an automated slide loader function enable a streamlined, versatile scalable workflow for high-throughput analysis.
 We used IMC technology to characterize immune cell populations and the spatial distribution of T cell exhaustion markers across various cancer types. We applied a 40-plus-marker IMC panel by integrating the Human Immuno-Oncology IMC Panel with the Human T Cell Exhaustion IMC Panel to study the TME of multiple human tissues.
 IMC analysis revealed striking heterogeneity with distinct tumor and immune-rich niches in the TME. In colon adenocarcinoma, we detected functional effector T cells and multiple tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). In contrast, we observed fewer TLSs and more T cells expressing PD-1 and TIM-3 at the tumor periphery in the urothelial carcinoma tissue, suggesting that they are in advanced exhaustion stages. We also observed expression of PD-L1, IDO and VISTA in the tumor cells. t-SNE and PhenoGraph clustering analysis of Cell Mode data segregated and spatially resolved the T cells into effector and exhausted T cell subpopulations, which were mapped back to the segmented cell masks. Unsupervised pixel clustering and analyses of Tissue Mode data further delineated distinct tumor areas based on the presence of infiltrating immune cells, tumor replicative activity and spatial proximity to stromal components.
 This work characterizing T cell exhaustion markers in multiple cancers showcases the capabilities of IMC technology and establishes it as a reliable high-plex, high-throughput spatial biology imaging platform. IMC technology is ideally suited for developing future translational and clinical applications and has the potential to help guide personalized therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis, since most PDAC tumors develop resistance to the standard of care (SoC) treatments like chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies. All tumors consist of multiple, genetically related subpopulations of cancer cells that evolve in parallel and display heterogeneity at genomic, epigenetic, or phenotypic levels. As cancer develops, some subpopulations of cancer cells may show faster growth, increased metastatic potential, and resistance toward SoC treatment. A key challenge in PDAC management is understanding chemoresistance driven by cancer subpopulation dynamics. This would broaden our understanding of tumor adaptation to treatments and guide targeting resistant subpopulations to improve therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we identified PDAC cell subpopulations resistant to chemotherapy using our DNA barcoding system B-GLI (barcode-guide lineage isolation). The B-GLI system leverages a highly complex DNA barcode library and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) to trace and isolate sub-lineages within heterogeneous cell populations by their DNA barcodes. PDAC cell lines PANC-1 and Mia-PaCa-2 were barcoded with the B-GLI barcode library, which consist of two optimized guide RNA binding sites in each barcode. After DNA barcoding, we performed treatments with two SoC chemotherapeutics, gemcitabine + paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX, to induce a selection pressure in the PDAC cell lines, and then identified the resistant subpopulations through differentially represented barcodes and sequencing. Furthermore, we designed barcode-specific single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the resistant subpopulations and activated the expression of the puromycin resistance gene by CRISPRa. This allowed us to enrich and isolate chemoresistant subpopulations by puromycin treatment. After having isolated the resistant PDAC subpopulations, we performed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq for molecular characterization of the resistant and parental cell populations, along with phenotypic drug screening with 384 compounds to identify novel treatment vulnerabilities. The compound testing confirmed that the resistant cells were less sensitive to the two SoC treatments, as well as identified selective sensitivity to specific compounds. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data will allow us to decode whether and how chromatin structure and transcriptomic changes are associated with the treatment resistance, and the confirmation screen of the drug sensitivities will identify potential compounds for future pre-clinical and clinical testing in PDAC models and patients with resistant disease. In summary, this study will identify targeted treatment alternatives, accompanied by molecular biomarkers for chemotherapy resistant PDAC.

Analyzing scRNA-seq data from 185 CRC patients we found that immune, structural, and cancer cells in MSS tumors with high numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells and macrophages (TAMs; CD8hiTAMhi) and CD8lowTAMhi tumors were enriched for pathways associated with anti- and pro-tumor responses, respectively. In CD8hiTAMhi tumors, TAMs expressed an IFN-induced phenotype (e.g. GBP1, CXCL9, IFITM3) and high infiltration of GBP1+ TAMs was associated with better overall survival (n=941). High-resolution spatial transcriptomics (Visium HD) revealed that GBP1+ TAMs clustered with CXCL13+IFNG+PDCD1+ CD8 T cells in tumoral niches, suggesting that GBP1+ TAMs were involved in recruitment and activation of tumor-reactive CD8 T cells. Together, we uncovered coordinated cellular programs across cell types in the microenvironment of MSS tumors, based on simple classification variables, that were strongly associated with prognosis.">

        <tr id="Objective This study examines the cellular heterogeneity of epithelial cells within pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and their contributions to tumor progression, metastasis, and immunosuppressive interactions using single-cell RNA sequencing. Methods Single-cell RNA-sequencing data from two datasets (GSE154778 and GSE158356) were integrated using the Harmony algorithm, followed by quality control, clustering, and differential gene expression analysis. Distinct subpopulations of epithelial cells were identified, and their gene expression profiles were analyzed. To assess the malignancy of these subpopulations, single-cell copy number variation (CNV) analysis and trajectory analysis were conducted. Additionally, intercellular communication was examined using the CellChat platform. Results The analysis revealed pronounced heterogeneity among PDAC epithelial cells, with specific subpopulations exhibiting distinct roles in tumor proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and metastatic dissemination. Subpopulations 4 and 6 were characterized by increased CNV levels and a more malignant phenotype, suggesting an enhanced capacity for metastasis. Single-cell trajectory analysis, along with CellChat, mapped the temporal evolution of epithelial cells, identifying key regulatory genes such as DCBLD2 and JUN. A prognostic model incorporating five key genes, including KLF6, was developed and demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for patient outcomes. Notably, KLF6 emerged as a critical prognostic marker associated with immune modulation, particularly through interactions with M2 macrophages. Conclusion The study highlights the pronounced heterogeneity of epithelial cells in PDAC and their distinct contributions to tumor progression, metastasis, and immune modulation. Through single-cell transcriptomic and CNV analyses, we identified epithelial subpopulations with varying malignant potentials and distinct interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Among these, KLF6 emerged as a key regulator associated with immune modulation and metastasis. Our findings emphasize the significance of epithelial cell heterogeneity in shaping pancreatic cancer progression. These insights provide a foundation for future investigations into novel prognostic markers and therapeutic strategies.

 Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common and aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by tissue invasion and metastasis, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. The tumor microenvironment (TME), composed of stromal and immune cells, plays a critical role in IDC progression and therapy resistance. However, the spatial organization and molecular heterogeneity within the IDC TME remain underexplored. Spatial transcriptomics enables the preservation of tissue architecture while revealing molecular signatures at single-cell resolution, offering new insights into cancer biology. We utilized the CosMx® Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) platform with the CosMx Whole Transcriptome panel (approximately 19, 000 genes) to analyze a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) IDC tumor sample. The platform provides high-resolution, multiplexed RNA detection within its native tissue context. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the same slide provided a histological reference for spatial transcriptomics. Transcriptomic data were analyzed using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and Leiden clustering to identify cell clusters and spatial patterns. Marker genes for each cluster were used to annotate cell types and assess their roles within the TME. Analysis identified two distinct tumor regions, each subdivided into subregions with unique and shared gene expression profiles. These tumor regions aligned with histological features observed in H&E staining, validating the spatial transcriptomic findings. We observed region-specific stromal compositions, with fibroblast populations exhibiting distinct gene expression patterns. For example, one region was enriched for PIGR, CLU, and LTF, markers linked to immune response, tumor progression, and tumor-suppressive properties. These results highlight the molecular and spatial heterogeneity of IDC and the complex interactions within the TME. This study demonstrates the potential of spatial transcriptomics to uncover the molecular and spatial complexity of IDC. Integrating transcriptomic data with histological validation revealed novel insights into the TME, highlighting key gene signatures and stromal dynamics. The CosMx platform is a powerful tool for advancing precision oncology and guiding future therapeutic strategies in IDC.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. An important contributor to CRC development, maintenance and metastasis is the tumor microenvironment (TME). This cellular milieu contains neighboring tumor epithelial cells, normal epithelium, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells and many others. The characterization of the TME is critical for understanding tumor biology as well as determining specific features with clinical implications. Representing a subset of the TME, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) has specific cellular characteristics that are important predictors for the response to treatments such as immunotherapy. However, the accurate interpretation of complex spatial cell patterns poses significant challenges. To address these issues, we developed a novel computational framework that systematically analyzes spatial data. We conducted a spatial analysis using imaging mass cytometry applied to stage III colorectal adenocarcinomas. This study used multiplexed markers to distinguish individual cells and their spatial organization from 52 colorectal cancers. We determined the landscape features of cellular spatial features in the CRC tumor microenvironment. This spatial single-cell analysis identified 10 unique cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment that included stromal and immune cells with a subset which had a proliferative phenotype. These special features included spatial neighborhood interactions between single cells as well as different tissue niches, especially the tumor infiltrating lymphocyte regions. We applied a robust statistical analysis to identify significant correlations of cell features with phenotypes such as microsatellite instability or recurrence. We determined that microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers had an increased risk of recurrence if they had the following features: 1) a low level of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and 2) low interactions between CD4+ T cells and stromal cells. Our computational framework precisely defined two types of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) based on their spatial properties in the local tumor microenvironment: 1) intra-tumoral TILs within cancer CNs and 2) sTILs within stromal CNs. These spatial characterizations of TILs provide deeper insights into their role, beyond simple lymphocyte abundance. Moreover, our results point to the utility of spatial single-cell interaction analysis in defining novel features of the tumor immune microenvironments and providing useful clinical cell-related spatial biomarkers.

 Identification of the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) opened significant potential for understanding the tumor biology and intertumoral heterogeneity of colorectal cancer (CRC). Molecular subtyping in CRC traditionally relies on bulk transcriptomics. However, single-cell transcriptomics studies have shown that CRC tumors may be composed of tumor cells displaying different CMS traits, suggesting additional intratumoral heterogeneity.



 To investigate intratumoral heterogeneity at protein level, we constructed tissue microarrays using tumor cores from 222 CRC patients. Arrays were stained and imaged with Cell DIVE multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) imaging using 54 selected protein markers, ranging from cell identity markers to cancer hallmark proteins of metabolism, proliferation, cell death and differentiation. RNA sequencing data and CMS classification were also available for all patients. After segmentation of tumor, stromal and immune cells, we investigated intratumoral heterogeneity within CMS subtypes using spatially resolved single-cell protein profiling (>2 million cells). We compared cell types, their spatial organization and their expression of cancer hallmark-related proteins in CMS 1-4 subtypes.



 We revealed tissue atlases illustrating the cell types/states, spatial heterogeneity, cellular neighborhoods, cellular network, and single-cell protein profiles of CMS tumors. CMS1 tumors had more CD3+, CD8+, and PD1+ immune cells that were found in the epithelial layer more frequently than in the other subtypes. CMS1 was also associated with higher levels of metabolic reprogramming markers such as upregulated glycolysis. CMS2 showed immune segregation, reactive stroma patterns, and higher levels of apoptotic and proliferative signaling proteins. CMS3 exhibited tightly clustered cancer cells with high RIP3 and low FLIP levels, suggesting a pro-inflammatory microenvironment driven by intense cell-cell interactions and stromal hubs. CMS4 displayed stromal-centric and immune-evasive tumors characterized by decreased HLA-1 levels and regulatory T cell exclusion from epithelium.



 We present the first spatial atlas of CRC tumors with regard to their molecular subtypes at single-cell protein resolution and demonstrate new spatial aspects of tumor structures in CRC.

 Stromal cells in the prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) affect tumor progression and exhibit both a universal response to tumorigenesis and specific ones determined by the genotype that drives the tumor (Pakula et al., Nat Commun 2024). As a result, stromal clusters associated with murine and human prostate cancer identified by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) fall into a) common subtypes: myofibroblasts/pericytes and innate immunity-associated; as well as b) two additional ones specific to either AR positive adenocarcinomas or neuroendocrine tumors (NEPC). Here, we defined their spatial localization leveraging spatial transcriptomics and multiplex in situ RNA hybridization.



 We computationally identify the most discriminative genes able to distinguish the four stromal groups. Specifically, we first identified highly discriminatory genes representative of each cluster. We then used integer programming-based optimization to obtain small sets of genes (n<4) that are differentially expressed in each group compared to the remaining three. For instance, group 0, encompassing myofibroblasts and pericytes, was characterized by the expression of Rgs5 and Myh11, while group 2, whose stromal cells are characterized by the expression of Ar and Wnt signaling genes, was characterized by the expression of Wif1 and Coch. A decision-tree analysis was able to discriminate all the different stromal groups. These were validated using 1) in situ RNA hybridization + multiplex immunofluorescence panels and 2) spatial transcriptomics. Myofibroblasts/pericytes were found to be distant to tumor cells, common clusters were associated with all tumors of diverse phenotype (Tmprss2-ERG, cMYC, Pten-/-, Pten-/-/ Rb1-/- NMYC+/+), while periostin high/AR low clusters were immediately adjacent to NEPC foci in mouse models.



 Our integrated computational and experimental approach establishes a robust pipeline for validating stromal markers identified through scRNA-seq, enabling spatial mapping of stromal heterogeneity in prostate cancer.

 Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a highly diverse cell population that plays a crucial role in shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME). Their spatial interactions within the TME remain to be systematically characterized, and the factors driving their phenotypic heterogeneity are not yet fully understood. Recent advancements in single-cell spatial transcriptomics technologies and cell segmentation approaches enable the precise measurement of thousands of transcripts at subcellular resolution. Combined with innovative bioinformatics, these advancements have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for in-depth characterization of CAFs and their interactions within the TME.



 We conducted a comprehensive spatial transcriptomic analysis of CAFs across 8 cancer types, using the CosMx and MERSCOPE platforms to profile nearly 6 million cells as part of our discovery cohorts. We developed a novel computational method to spatially cluster CAF subpopulations and defined four distinct spatial CAF subtypes. We further examined their phenotypic differences, spatial niche organization, and interactions with neighboring cells. Additionally, we investigated the influence of CAF subtypes on immune cell phenotypes and infiltration levels. To validate our findings, we employed multiple spatial platforms, including Visium, Xenium, COMET, CODEX, and IMC, to ensure reproducibility across diverse technologies. Moreover, we performed correlative studies in large-cohorts with rich clinical data to evaluate the clinical significance of these CAF subtypes.



 Our approach provided an unprecedented high-resolution examination of the spatial phenotypes of CAFs in large, complex tissues, uncovering novel insights. We comprehensively characterized CAFs across various solid tumor types and identified four conserved spatial CAF subtypes. These subtypes are characterized by distinct cell organizational patterns, neighboring cell compositions, interaction networks, and transcriptomic features. Moreover, they demonstrate significant correlations with the abundance, distribution, and phenotypes of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, as well as associations with tumor histopathological features and clinical outcomes.



 Our study provides a pan-cancer, high-resolution characterization of CAF spatial organization and interactions in solid tumors and identified conserved spatial CAF subtypes linked to distinct organizational patterns. Our findings reveal that the transcriptomic states and phenotypes of CAFs are significantly shaped by their interactions with neighboring cancer and immune cells. Beyond offering novel insights into the spatial heterogeneity of CAFs, this work paves the way for developing strategies to effectively target and modulate CAFs for therapeutic benefit.

        <tr id="Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables gene expression analysis within spatial context of tissues. Since most data are limited to multicellular resolution, current computational methods can only estimate cell proportions. To address this gap, we introduce SpatioCell, a framework that integrates imaging data-derived morphological features with transcriptomic measurements for precise single-cell annotation. SpatioCell combines automated adaptive prompting with an optimized vision model for accurate cell segmentation and morphological analysis. Dynamic programming then optimizes cell-type assignments by integrating H&E-derived morphology and transcriptomic constraints, improving resolution within and beyond ST spots. Extensive benchmarking on histopathological, simulated, and real ST data from five distinct cancer types shows that SpatioCell outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both nuclear segmentation and cell annotation accuracy. Notably, SpatioCell reveals tumor microenvironment details, such as tumor boundaries, blood vessel structures, and immune infiltration, that were missed by other methods, while also showing strong potential in correcting deconvolution errors to further increase annotation accuracy.

        <tr id="Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, primarily consists of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including subtypes like lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). These subtypes exhibit distinct histopathological features but share overlapping molecular characteristics. Understanding the spatial and molecular heterogeneity of these tumors is critical for identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This study utilizes the CosMx® Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) platform to profile LUAD and LUSC, aiming to uncover shared and unique gene signatures, tumor heterogeneity, and rare tumor cell subtypes, while integrating histopathological insights from H&E staining. Two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung tumor samples—one LUAD and one LUSC—were profiled using the CosMx Whole Transcriptome (WTX) panel, which profiles approximately 19,000 genes with single-cell subcellular resolution. Spatial transcriptomic data were analyzed using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and Leiden clustering to identify cell clusters. Marker genes were used to annotate cell types and generate a high-resolution cellular atlas of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed on the same slides, providing histopathological context and validating CosMx-derived cell types, including immune and tumor hotspots.

 Colon adenocarcinoma (CRC) features complex molecular changes and a dynamic remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Understanding spatial organization of gene expression in tumor and adjacent normal tissues is crucial for insights into tumorigenesis, immune modulation, and therapeutic resistance. Traditional methods like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provide cellular insights but lack spatial context. Spatial transcriptomics addresses this gap, offering high-resolution, whole transcriptome analysis within tissue architecture. This study applies spatial transcriptomics to CRC, correlating molecular data with histopathological features to explore tumor heterogeneity, immune dynamics, and therapeutic targets. FFPE tissue sections (5 µm) from colon adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal tissues were analyzed using the CosMx® Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) to create a spatially resolved whole transcriptome, single-cell map. The sections were stained with H&E for histopathological context, and spatial gene expression data was aligned with H&E-stained sections using custom software. Additionally, scRNA-seq was performed on a thicker curl (25 µm) from the same tissue block for comparative analysis. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct gene expression patterns between tumor and normal regions, highlighting tumor heterogeneity with subpopulations of cancer cells showing varying differentiation states. Immune cell infiltration varied spatially, indicating diverse immune responses across the tumor. While both platforms identified similar transcriptional profiles, the CosMx Whole Transcriptome (WTX) panel preserved tissue architecture, allowing exploration of gene expression in its native context. CosMx WTX showed a more accurate cell composition ratio than scRNA-seq, which may introduce bias due to tissue dissociation. CosMx WTX also captured rare cell populations, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, often underrepresented in scRNA-seq due to sample size limitations. The spatial context enabled pathway activity analysis and ligand-receptor interaction mapping, providing deeper insights into tumor biology. This study highlights the power of spatial transcriptomics in colon adenocarcinoma, offering insights into tumor heterogeneity, immune infiltration, and the TME. Integrating spatial gene expression with histopathological features enhances understanding of tumor progression and immune modulation. The comparison with scRNA-seq underscores the unique benefits of spatially resolved profiling, presenting a more complete picture of cellular functions within their native tissue architecture.

 Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides unprecedented insights into the spatial landscape of gene expression across tissues, crucial for understanding cancer heterogeneity. Many ST analysis methods, however, do not fully utilize the rich morphological information in histopathology images and are limited by small sample sizes and high costs. We developed an innovative multimodal framework combining spatial transcriptomics with histopathological features using advanced image-aware deep-learning models, aimed at identifying significant patterns missed by traditional clustering and leveraging these models to impute gene expression across tissue slides for large-scale biomarker discovery and mechanistic studies. Our study focuses on glioblastoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, utilizing fully sequenced and clinically characterized samples from 10x Genomics Visium ST and Visium HD, along with 10x to 40x high resolution whole-slide histopathology images. We segmented ST histological images into tiles; for Visium ST, tiles were squares with widths equivalent to spot diameters, while for Visium HD, tiles corresponded to 16-micron bins. Using models like ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), we extracted morphological features, creating a detailed feature matrix per spot. Unsupervised clustering applied to morphological features to explore underlying patterns without prior labels. Integrative analysis merged gene expression with morphological data to identify biologically significant clusters. Supervised learning predicted tumor microenvironment characteristics: local effects like hypoxia, specific cell-types such as microglia, and gene-level expressions. A classifier was trained to predict tile-level cell types and processors, leveraging expression levels of pertinent marker gene sets and gene signatures for each tumor type. Additionally, this model predicted tile-level gene expression by initially selecting genes with the highest Moran’s I values, which are indicative of spatial heterogeneity. This method assessed the predictive accuracy of various pre-trained model features. Findings demonstrate that ViT models achieved high Adjusted Rand Index scores, enhancing the identification of biologically enriched clusters as validated by gene set enrichment analysis. ViT predicted specific biological characteristics across slides, demonstrating its potential for imputing gene expression signatures in extensive pathology datasets. This study underscores the potential of integrating spatial transcriptomics with deep-learning, especially Vision Transformers, enhancing our ability to analyze tumor microenvironments for biomarker discovery and deeper biological insights.

Here, we employed the DNA nanoball-based genome-wide in situ sequencing (Stereo-seq) to visualize the geospatial architecture of 30 primary breast tumors and metastatic lymph nodes across different molecular subtypes. This unprecedented high-resolution atlas unveils the fine structure of the tumor vasculature, highlighting heterogeneity in phenotype, spatial distribution, and intercellular communication within both endothelial and perivascular cells. In particular, venular smooth muscle cells are identified as the primary source of CCL21/CCL19 within the microenvironment. In collaboration with ACKR1-positive endothelial cells, they create a chemokine-rich venular niche to synergistically promote lymphocyte extravasation into tumors. High venule density predicts increased immune infiltration and improved clinical outcomes.

        <tr id="PURPOSE
To identify the specific intratumoral and microenvironmental heterogeneity of acral (AM) and mucosal melanoma (MM), we aimed to delineate their distinct cellular compositions, evolutionary trajectories, and subtype-specific therapeutic strategies.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Single-cell transcriptomic and genomic landscapes were analyzed across 42 melanoma samples (28 AM, 11 MM, and 3 non-acral cutaneous melanoma [CM]), supplemented by in vitro and in vivo validation. Tumor and stromal cells were profiled using scRNA-seq, whole-exome sequencing, and functional assays, including transwell migration, co-culture systems, and xenograft models.


RESULTS
Tumor cells exhibited divergent evolutionary routes, with MM dominated by MGP⁺/PCOLCE⁺ subpopulations showing high epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) potential. MM displayed elevated neutrophil infiltration and CXCL3⁺ tumor-associated macrophages, while AM was enriched with PI16⁺ cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promoting tumor proliferation. Molecular classification revealed MM subtypes: an antigen-presenting subtype linked to favorable outcomes and a proliferative subtype associated with recurrence. TIGIT⁺ Treg cells were enriched in AM, suggesting targeted inhibition potential. Genomic analysis connected BRAF/NRAS mutations to ALDOA⁺ stem-like tumor cells and identified PTGDS as a therapeutic target in triple-WT melanomas.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study provides a comprehensive comparison of AM and MM, uncovering subtype-specific stromal-immune interactions and molecular programs. The findings highlight actionable targets (e.g., TIGIT in AM, CXCL3⁺ macrophages in MM) and propose a framework for precision therapies, biomarker-driven trials, and risk stratification to improve outcomes in these aggressive melanomas.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) often exhibits poor response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies, largely owing to the intricate composition and spatial organization of immune cells within the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME). The diversity of immune cell populations, their spatial relationships, and dynamic interactions significantly influence the immunosuppressive nature of the TIME, thereby limiting the efficacy of immunotherapy. To address these challenges and enhance the therapeutic potential of ICIs in HNSCC, a comprehensive analysis of the TIME is essential. Spatial transcriptomics (ST), a cutting-edge technology, enables high-resolution mapping of gene expression within the spatial context of the tumor, providing critical insights into the functional roles and interactions of immune cells in the TIME. This review highlights the importance of ST in uncovering the complexities of the TIME in HNSCC and proposes strategies for leveraging these insights to develop more effective immunotherapeutic approaches. By integrating spatial and molecular information, this review aims to pave the way for personalized and precision-based treatments in HNSCC, ultimately improving patient outcomes.">

 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a highly dynamic and complex ecosystem, where the diversity of cell types, their functional states, and spatial interactions determine responses to immunotherapy. Despite its critical role, the precise mechanisms through which these factors influence clinical outcomes remain poorly understood. In this study, we leveraged single-cell spatial transcriptomics to systematically dissect the TME and identify determinants of immunotherapeutic response in vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (vHSIL).
 We analyzed 20 treatment-naïve vHSIL lesions, stratified based on clinical response to tumor-specific peptide vaccination into: complete responders (CR, 100% lesion clearance, n=6), partial responders (PR, >50% lesion clearance, n=7), and non-responders (NR, <50% lesion clearance, n=7). Using a 1000-gene panel, we mapped over 274, 000 single cells in situ, revealing 18 cell clusters that were further delineated into 99 distinct non-epithelial cell states. Validation against public single-cell transcriptomic datasets confirmed the broader relevance of these findings across tumor types.
 Our findings demonstrated profound heterogeneity within the TME across response groups. Notably, CR lesions exhibited a significantly higher ratio of immune-supportive to immune-suppressive cells compared to PR and NR lesions—a pattern mirrored in other solid tumors following neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade therapy (anti-PD1, anti-PDL1, anti-CTLA4). Key immune populations enriched in CR lesions included CD4+CD161+ effector T cells and chemotactic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, implicating these populations as critical drivers of favorable therapeutic outcomes. Conversely, PR lesions were characterized by increased proportions of T helper 2 cells and CCL18-expressing macrophages, which are associated with the recruitment of type 2 T cells and regulatory T cells. NR lesions displayed preferential infiltration with immunosuppressive fibroblasts. Distinct spatial immune ecosystems further defined response groups: type 1 effector cells dominated interactions in CR lesions, type 2 cells were prominently interacting in PR lesions, while NR lesions lacked organized immune cell interactions.
 Thus, these findings emphasize the dual importance of cellular composition and spatial organization in steering response to immunotherapy. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying clinical responses to immunotherapeutic vaccination, this study provides actionable insights to advance precision immunotherapy.

 Heterogeneity in colorectal cancer (CRC) manifests as inter- and intra-patient diversity in tumor and immune cell populations as well as varied patterns of tumor interaction with surrounding stroma. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) captures gene expression within the native spatial context of tissues, offering a high-resolution approach to dissect cancer molecular landscapes. Prior ST studies in CRC have been constrained by small sample sizes and tissue selection biases, reducing clinical relevance. Here we performed ST (10x Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression) on 40 retrospectively-collected CRC samples with available clinicopathological data (stages I-IV: 13, 8, 14, and 5 samples, respectively) and long-term clinical outcomes to define the molecular topography and spatial heterogeneity of tumors with their stromal context. Using ST data, we identified recurring spot-level (55-micron resolution) tumor and stromal sub-populations across the cohort, designating them as T1 (marker genes EPCAM, LGALS4, and FXYD3) and T2 (marker genes KRT8, KRT18, and KRT19) for tumor subtypes, and F1 (marker genes SPARC and LUM) and F2 (marker genes COL3A1 and PTGDS) for stromal subtypes. Comprehensive analysis of tumor/stromal pairs—including copy number variations (CNVs), cell type compositions, pathway activations, metabolic profiles, spatial distributions, and histological characteristics—revealed pathways enriched in T2 compared to T1, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, hypoxia response, TGF-beta signaling, and metabolic pathways supporting the energy and biosynthetic demands of aggressive tumor cells. We also identified recurrent spatially co-localized tumor and stromal sub-clonal pairs—T1&F2 and T2&F1—that consistently preserved their spatial architecture across samples. Notably, the prevalence of T1&F2 was significantly correlated with disease-specific survival (DSS) (log-rank test, p=0.05), highlighting the prognostic importance of tumor-microenvironment interactions. Using a transformer-based image feature encoder, we demonstrated that these clusters are morphologically distinguishable in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images co-registered with the ST data, achieving an AUC (the Area Under the ROC Curve) of 0.84 for distinguishing T1 from T2 and an AUC of 0.75 for distinguishing F1 from F2. These clusters were also detected in H&E images from external datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, N=232) and an independent validation set (N=107). Deep learning models trained on TCGA data further revealed a trend where higher T2 prevalence or lower T1 prevalence correlated with shorter overall survival. This ST study establishes novel molecular subtypes and their spatial co-occurrence in CRC, linking spatial behaviors to clinically prognostic and H&E-based morphological characteristics.

 Background:
 Understanding cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is essential for elucidating disease progression and advancing immunotherapy. The TME is a complex ecosystem composed of cells with dysregulated metabolism immune response and signaling pathways, which in turn influence tumor development and treatment response. Multiplexed assessment serves as an important tool for clinical oncology. The simultaneous readout of multiple processes can provide biological insights and elucidate disease mechanism. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) is a spatial biology imaging technique that utilizes CyTOF technology and enables deep characterization of the diversity and complexity of the TME. IMC technology offers scalable, high-throughput acquisition while generating high-quality data with true dynamic range of signal without amplification or fluorescence-based limitations such as spectral overlap and autofluorescence.
 Methods:
 To study cellular processes and their roles in tumor progression, we utilized the Human Cell Metabolism and Human Cell Signaling Panels to investigate energy production, cellular homeostasis and mitogenic signaling pathways. We then mapped these processes to the types of cells in the TME by using the Human Immuno-Oncology IMC Panel and the Human T Cell Exhaustion IMC Panel or the Maxpar Neuro Phenotyping IMC Panel Kit to characterize immune cell and neurological phenotypes in detail. We first acquired data using Preview Mode to assess the whole tissue, followed by higher-resolution imaging of selected regions of interest using Cell Mode or of the whole tissue section using Tissue Mode.
 Results:
 Our data analysis revealed significant insights into the spatial organization and metabolic profile of cells across cancer tissues. Elevated glycolysis and mTOR pathway activation suggested adaptations to hypoxia and anabolic growth in tumor areas, while interactions between fibroblasts and immune cells highlighted crosstalk within the TME. Our Neuro Phenotyping Panel was used to reveal potential for immune response in glioblastoma. Unsupervised pixel clustering and hierarchical clustering using MCD SmartViewer highlighted metabolic activity and activation of signaling pathways within tumor regions.
 Conclusions:
 Comprehensive spatial biology profiling using the IMC approach highlights the interconnected roles these pathways play in promoting tumor survival and resistance to therapies. These findings, which illuminate the metabolic and signaling heterogeneity of the TME, are crucial for developing future prognostic assessments and have the potential to guide more effective, personalized cancer therapies.

        <tr id="Solid cancers are complex 'ecosystems' comprised of diverse cell types and extracellular molecules, where heterotypic interactions significantly influence disease etiology and therapeutic response. However, our current understanding of tumor microenvironments (TMEs) remains incomplete, hindering the development and implementation of novel TME-targeted drugs. To maximize cancer therapeutic development we require a systems-level understanding of the malignant, stromal, and immune states that define the tumor and determine treatment response. In their recent study, Liu and colleagues took a new approach to resolving the complexity of stromal heterogeneity. They leveraged extensive single-cell spatial multi-omics datasets across various cancer types and platforms to identify four conserved spatial Cancer-Associated Fibroblast (CAF) subtypes, classified by their spatial organization and cellular neighborhoods. Their work expands upon prior efforts to develop a CAF taxonomy, which primarily relied on single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and yielded a multitude of classification systems. This study advances our understanding of CAF biology by establishing a link between spatial context and CAF identity across diverse tumor types. Departing from recent single-cell transcriptomics studies that employed a marker-based approach for sub-state identification, Liu and colleagues conducted de novo discovery of CAF subtypes using spatial neighborhood information alone. By positioning spatial organization as the defining axis of CAF heterogeneity, this research redefines CAF classification and provides a new framework for exploring the rules governing tumor ecosystems and developing novel ecosystem-based therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="The cellular heterogeneity of prostate cancer cells has been well-established, yet the spatial diversity of stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment remains largely unexplored. In this study, we utilized cyclic immunofluorescence imaging of whole-tissue sections to map spatial relationships between cancer cells and various immune and non-immune stromal populations in primary Gleason pattern 3 and 4 tumors. Our analysis identified over 20 androgen receptor (AR)-positive stromal cell types, many of which have minimal data on their response to AR inhibitors. Notably, we identified distinct AR+ mast cell populations exhibiting unique spatial associations with M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. Using spatial statistical tools and recurrent cellular neighborhood analysis, we identified disease-specific microenvironments predominantly driven by AR+ stromal cells and uncovered inflammatory gene networks active within AR+ stromal regions. Future work will expand this analysis to spatiotemporal profiling of intermediate-risk patients, aiming to improve tumor stratification for more precise clinical decision-making.

 Tumors are dynamic ecosystems where interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) shape malignancy. Using spatial transcriptomics, we analyzed 63 untreated tumors from 10 cancer types to investigate the spatial distribution of 13 cancer hallmarks. Our findings reveal that hallmark activity is spatially organized, with distinct compartmentalization of hallmark phenotypes across neoplastic and TME regions. Hallmarks such as "Resisting Cell Death" and "Enabling Replicative Immortality" were enriched in cancer-dominant areas, while "Inducing Angiogenesis" and "Activating Invasion and Metastasis" were primarily localized to the TME. Genomic analysis showed that subclonal diversity influences hallmark specialization, with genetically distinct clones often occupying specific ecological niches. These insights suggest that hallmark activities are not uniformly distributed but instead reflect the interplay between genetic heterogeneity and tumor spatial organization.
 We further modeled the spatial interdependence of hallmarks between the neoplastic and TME compartments, demonstrating that hallmark activities are shaped by ecological dynamics across the tumor. For example, hallmarks such as "Sustaining Proliferative Signaling" in the TME interface strongly influenced cancer cell hallmark expression. Application of this framework to 33 bladder cancer patients from the DUTRENEO trial revealed correlations between hallmark spatial patterns and treatment response. Notably, differences in the spatial localization of "Inducing Angiogenesis" and "Resisting Cell Death" were linked to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy sensitivity. These findings underscore the importance of spatial hallmark distribution in determining drug efficacy and suggest that spatial hallmark signatures could serve as predictive biomarkers for personalized cancer therapy.

        <tr id="Lymphomas are highly heterogeneous malignancies characterized by diverse genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic profiles, which complicate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Traditional bulk sequencing methods mask the complexity of intratumoral variation, often overlooking rare subclones that may drive disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Single-cell genomics has emerged as a transformative approach to decipher tumor heterogeneity at unprecedented resolution. This technology enables the dissection of individual cellular populations within lymphomas, offering insights into clonal evolution, transcriptional diversity, and microenvironmental interactions. By applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), chromatin accessibility assays (scATAC-seq), and single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq), researchers can unravel lineage relationships, identify resistant subpopulations, and track dynamic changes in response to therapy. In lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), single-cell approaches have revealed distinct malignant and non-malignant cell states that correlate with treatment outcomes. Moreover, integrating single-cell data with spatial transcriptomics and immune profiling enhances the understanding of the tumor microenvironment, including immune evasion mechanisms. These insights can inform personalized treatment strategies, identify novel therapeutic targets, and enable early detection of relapse. Despite technical challenges such as data complexity, sample viability, and cost, the application of single-cell genomics in lymphoma research is rapidly advancing. Future directions include multi-omics integration, real-time patient monitoring, and clinical translation of predictive biomarkers.

        <tr id="Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal malignant intracranial tumor, distinguished from low-grade glioma by histopathological hallmarks such as pseudopalisading cells around necrosis (PAN) and microvascular proliferation (MVP). To date the spatial organization of the molecular and cellular components of these specific histopathological features has not been fully elucidated. Methods Here, using bulk RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomic and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of GBM patients, we identified niche-specific transcriptional programs and characterized the differences in molecular expression and cellular organization between PAN and MVP. Results Notably, we discovered spatially distinct domains within the tumor core and identified niche-specific signatures: NDRG1 and EPAS1, specifically expressed in the PAN and MVP regions. The clustering results showed two distinct phenotypes of endothelial cells (ECs) were enriched in the MVP and PAN regions, respectively. PAN-associated endothelial cells exhibit copy number variations similar to those in GBM cells. Single cell trajectory analysis reveals a pseudotime trajectory, indicating the differentiation of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) toward ECs. Conclusions Necrosis cores which are surrounded by hypoxic and perivascular niches and microvascular proliferation area within the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment, have been considered as standardized morphological indicators of aggressive GBM. Our findings provide a cellular and molecular insights into GBM progression. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12967-025-06185-z.">

        <tr id="Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents the most common pathological type of lung cancer, and the combination of neoadjuvant immunotherapy with chemotherapy has emerged as the first-line treatment for NSCLC. Nevertheless, the efficacy of this therapeutic approach remains variable. The present study aims to examine the impact of chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC patients, with a view to identifying key molecules, critical cell subpopulations, communication patterns and spatial distributions that potentially correlate with therapeutic sensitivity. A total of 16 lung cancer tissue samples were collected from a cohort of 12 NSCLC patients and subjected to single-cell RNA and spatial transcriptome sequencing. Our data demonstrated that the distribution of CD4 + Treg T cells and mCAFs indicated an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, while the accumulation of CD4 + Th17 T cells and iCAFs could act as a positive marker for the sensitivity to chemoimmunotherapy. Furthermore, a significant high level of SELENOP-macrophages was observed in tissues from positive responders, and a strong co-localization between SELENOP-macrophages and antigen-presenting cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor boundaries was identified, indicating the cooperative roles of these two cell types in response to combined therapy. Moreover, SELENOP-macrophages were observed to be accumulated in tertiary lymphoid structures, which further suggested its critical role in recruiting lymphocytes. Furthermore, analysis of cell–cell communication, based on spatial transcriptomics, suggests that the interactions between SELENOP-macrophages, apCAFs, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were significantly enhanced in responders. In addition, SELENOP-macrophages recruited CD4 + Naïve, Helper and CD8 + Naïve T cells through pathways such as the cholesterol, interleukin, chemokine and HLA when responding to combined therapy. The present study further unveils the dynamic spatial and transcriptional changes in the tumor microenvironment of non-small cell lung cancer in response to combination therapy.

This study aimed to systematically analyze the transcriptional characteristics of different cell types in NPC and their roles in tumor development using single-cell transcriptomics. Methods The research team collected NPC and normal tissue samples, and performed in-depth single-cell sequencing analysis of the transcriptomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on the collected samples to obtain high-resolution transcriptional profiles of individual cells. This allowed the researchers to identify and characterize the diverse cell populations present within the NPC tumor microenvironment. Results The results showed that NPC samples contained multiple distinct cell subpopulations, including epithelial cells, immune cells (such as macrophages and T cells), endothelial cells, and stromal cells. These cell types exhibited marked differences in spatial distribution and transcriptional profiles, reflecting the high degree of heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment. Further functional analysis revealed significant dysregulation of mitochondrial-related pathways, extracellular matrix-receptor interactions, as well as Wnt, Notch, and other signaling cascades in NPC. Conclusion This study employed single-cell transcriptomics to comprehensively elucidate the complexity of the NPC tumor microenvironment, providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and suggesting potential therapeutic targets. These findings lay the groundwork for the development of precision medicine approaches for NPC.">

        <tr id="Background Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is characterized by a high degree of genomic but also functional intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH). Mutations in VHL, chromatin remodeling genes such as SETD2 and genes that regulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway have been identified as recurrent drivers despite genomic ITH. Whether and to what extent these mutations shape functional ITH including the formation of spatial niches is incompletely understood. Herein, we analyze the correlation between mutational drivers and their functional proxies in a spatially defined manner. Methods A total of 23 RCCs were analyzed by panel next-generation sequencing followed by immunohistochemistry for five functional proxies for key genetic alterations including the expression of CD31, GLUT1, phospho-mTOR S2448, H3K36me3 and Ki-67. Antibody stainings were scored semiquantitatively in the tumor periphery and the tumor center. Results Unexpectedly, the presence of a VHL mutation was not found to correlate with its functional proxies including the expression of CD31/microvessel density or the expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1. Likewise, there was no correlation between the presence of activating mutations in genes of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and the expression of activated phospho-mTOR S2448. Furthermore, mutations in the methyltransferase gene SETD2 were not found to correlate with the expression level of its downstream target H3K36me3. Lastly, there was no correlation between the expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 and the number of driver mutations.

        <tr id="Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by early liver metastasis and high mortality. The tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in tumor progression; however, the immune microenvironment's involvement in PDAC liver metastasis remains poorly understood. Methods: This study investigates cellular heterogeneity in primary tumor (PT) and liver metastasis (LM) tissues of PDAC using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. Intra-tumor heterogeneity and cell interactions were elucidated through deconvolution, intercellular signalling, pseudotime analysis, and immune infiltration profiling. The spatial distribution of immune cells was assessed by multiplexed immunofluorescence staining, and prognostic models were developed and validated through immunohistochemistry (IHC). Analyzing the regulatory role of CITED4 in the invasion and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells through transwell assay and scratch wound healing assay. Results: A total of 62,326 cells were sequenced, with metastatic dissemination cells showing significant upregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes during liver metastasis. Spatial transcriptomics revealed the enrichment of metastatic dissemination cells and FOXP3-related Treg cells at the tumor front in PT tissues. In comparison to LM tissues, the tumor front in PT tissues fosters an immunosuppressive microenvironment through the accumulation of Treg cells. Interaction analysis identified the SPP1 pathway as a key promoter of this immunosuppressive environment. Furthermore, prognostic models highlighted CITED4 as critical biomarkers in PDAC. Elevated CITED4 expression is correlated with liver metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with PDAC. siRNA-mediated knockdown of CITED4 suppresses the invasion and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. Conclusions: In summary, this study revealed that Treg cell alterations, mediated by metastatic dissemination cells within the immune microenvironment, significantly contribute to PDAC liver metastasis, and that CITED4 enhances the metastatic potential of metastatic dissemination cells.">

 Despite advances in single-cell technologies, integrating multimodal data to capture both the genetic and phenotypic dynamics of tumor cells in their microenvironment remains a challenge.



 We leverage variations in cell cycle state as a natural barcode to link data across different modalities. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this method in a gastric cancer cell line (NCI-N87) using two widely different technologies: single-cell RNA sequencing and live-cell imaging. Our approach begins with the transfection ofFUCCI probes into cells, followed by acquisition of 3D images using a Leica microscope. These images are then utilized to train a label-freeU-Net-based prediction model (FNet) to infer subcellular organization, specifically for the nucleus, mitochondria, and cytoplasm. FNet achieved correlation coefficients of 0.76, 0.70, and 0.78 for these compartments, respectively. Segmentation masks generated by CellPose enabled cell statistics calculations. We further applied deep learning methods, including a customized convolutional neural network (CNN)and a truncated ResNet50, to distinguish between cells in G1, S and G2M phases of the cell cycle. The CNN achieved an accuracy of 90.67% when using the nucleus alone and 91.63% when using all three compartments (nucleus, mitochondria, and cytoplasm).
 Deep features were extracted by removing the classification layer and flattening the convolutional layer feature maps. These features were then employed for cell cycle pseudotime inference. When projecting the features onto pseudotime, we observed a strong correlation between the inferred pseudotime and FUCCI-derived cell cycle states (Pearson r =-0.899, p-value < 1E-6). This finding demonstrates the ability to assign continuous cell cycle states directly from imaging data. Comparing imaging- and sequencing-derived cell cycle pseudotime obtained for the same cell line, we assigned 449 imaged cells to their corresponding 693 sequenced cells, achieving an average resolution of 3.4 cells per sequencing profile and 2.4 cells per imaging profile.



 This integration has opened new possibilities for linking genotype (from sequencing) and phenotype (from imaging), providing a forward-looking approach to genotype-phenotype mapping at single-cell resolution. Assigning the transcriptome of a sequenced cell to its closest living relative (still actively growing and expanding), will enable tracing the cellular trajectory in real-time, enabling a deeper understanding of how tumor cells adapt to their microenvironment and evolve over time.

Recent studies have highlighted greater heterogeneity in gene expression within metastatic tumor cells compared to primary tumor cells. However, the underlying factors driving these differences remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that both genetic alterations and the tumor microenvironment play key roles in shaping this heterogeneity. To investigate these aspects, we established a cohort through the Human Tumor Atlas Network composed of 26 primary CRC samples and 41 metastatic CRC samples from multiple organs. We conducted whole exome sequencing (WES), single-nucleus ATAC/RNA-seq (snATAC/RNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics (Xenium) assays to comprehensively analyze genetic alterations, gene expression patterns, and their spatial relations. Our findings revealed a higher proportion of TP53 and KRAS mutations in metastatic samples compared to primary tumor samples. Analysis of snRNA-seq data identified distinct tumor cell populations characterized by gene signatures from 12 published gene expression modules. Primary tumor cells were predominantly enriched for tumor intestinal stem cell-like and intestinal modules, while metastatic tumor cells showed higher representation of injury repair, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), osteoblast-like, and neuroendocrine modules. Notably, a microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) metastatic sample exhibited relatively higher signatures of absorptive intestinal and squamous cancer modules than other microsatellite-stable samples, suggesting a unique gene expression profile in MSI-high CRC metastasis. To spatially study these cancer modules, we defined spatial tumor microregions as regions of tumor cells separated by stromal tissues. Using the Xenium assay, we mapped the gene modules within these microregions and observed significant enrichment of EMT and injury repair modules at the peripheral tumor microregions in metastatic samples. Conversely, the hypoxia module was more prominently enriched at the core of tumor microregions in metastatic samples compared to primary tumors. These findings suggest a strong association between tumor cell location within the microenvironment and their gene expression profiles, shedding light on the spatial dynamics of tumor heterogeneity in CRC metastasis. In summary, our results suggest that the heterogeneity of gene expression in metastatic CRC is driven by genetic alterations and strongly influenced by the tumor microenvironment.

        <tr id="Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the U.S. Organoid models of solid tumors have been shown to faithfully recapitulate aspects of cancer progression such as proliferation and invasion. Although patient-derived organoids and patient-derived xenograft organoids are pathophysiologically relevant, they are costly to propagate, difficult to manipulate, and comprised primarily of the most proliferative cell types within the tumor microenvironment (TME). These limitations prevent their use for elucidating cellular mechanisms of disease progression that depend upon tumor-associated stromal cells which are found within the TME and known to contribute to metastasis and therapy resistance. Here, we report on methods for cultivating epithelial-stromal multicellular 3D cultures. The advantages of these methods include a cost-effective system for rapidly generating organoid-like 3D cultures within scaffold-free environments that can be used to track invasion at single-cell resolution within hydrogel scaffolds. Specifically, we demonstrate how to generate these heteromulticellular 3D cultures using BT-474 breast cancer cells in combination with fibroblasts (BJ-5ta), monocyte-like cells (THP-1), and/or endothelial cells (EA.hy926). Additionally, differential fluorescent labeling of cell populations enables time-lapse microscopy to define 3D culture assembly and invasion dynamics. Notably, the addition of any two stromal cell combinations to 3D cultures of BT-474 cells significantly reduces circularity of the 3D cultures, consistent with the presence of organoid-like or secondary spheroid structures. In tracker dye experiments, fibroblasts and endothelial cells co-localize in the peripheral organoid-like protrusions and are spatially segregated from the primary BT-474 spheroid. Finally, heteromulticellular 3D cultures of BT-474 cells have increased hydrogel invasion capacity. Since we observed these protrusive structures in heteromulticellular 3D cultures of both non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic breast epithelial cells, this work provides an efficient and reproducible method for generating organoid-like 3D cultures in a scaffold-free environment for subsequent analyses of phenotypes associated with solid tumor progression.">

 The tumor microenvironment (TME) of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been recently dissected and different TME-based subtypes of DLBCL proposed (Kotlov et al. Cancer Discov. 2021, Steen et al. Cancer Cell. 2021). Previous studies have, however, not systematically explored the spatial organization of the DLBCL TME and its association with biological and clinical factors.



 We performed multiplex immunofluorescence using a 12-plex antibody panel on diagnostic tumor samples from 99 patients with DLBCL. We characterized B cells, T cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and immune checkpoint molecules. We processed images using Ilastik and CellProfiler softwares, and segmented nuclei with a pretrained deep-learning model. We phenotyped the cells using the Phenograph algorithm combined with manual thresholding. We identified recurrent cellular neighborhoods (RCNs) and performed cell-cell interaction analyses using the scimap package (Python 3.9). We correlated the findings with biological and clinical characteristics and survival.



 We analyzed over 1.2 x 106 single cells with a median of 12 354 cells per patient. We identified 17 cell phenotypes, including various subgroups of B cells, T cells, and TAMs. Of the cell types, B cells were the most abundant (mean 55%), followed by CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (means 14% and 10%), and M2-like TAMs (mean 8%) with great heterogeneity between the samples. We identified 10 different RCNs with distinct cellular compositions across DLBCLs. The most common RCN was an immune-poor RCN (30% of the cells), followed by an RCN with high B cell content and a moderate immune cell infiltrate (22% of the cells). We also identified different T cell and TAM-rich RCNs. The RCNs subdivided DLBCLs into immune-poor areas and areas with diverse immune cell infiltrates. Notably, HLA-ABC positive lymphomas consisted of larger proportions of CD4+ T cell-rich RCNs (p < 0.05). Defined by the shortest average distance, immune-poor RCNs were located close to the RCNs that had high B cell content combined with moderate immune cell infiltrates but far from the T cell-rich RCNs. However, when CD8+ T cell-rich and immune-poor RCNs were close to each other, the outcome was favorable (progression-free survival (PFS); p < 0.05), whereas the proximity of PD-L1+ B cell-rich and CD8+ T cell-rich RCNs was associated with poor survival (PFS; p < 0.05). Finally, we correlated RCN proportions with lymphoma microenvironment (LME) and genetic subtypes. Immune-poor RCNs were common in the depleted LME subtype, whereas PD-L1+ M2-like TAM-rich RCNs were more common in the inflamed LME. In contrast, PD-L1+ M2-like TAM-rich RCNs were rare in EZB-type DLBCLs.



 Our data show that DLBCL TME is organized into RCNs that are associated with distinct molecular and subtypic features and patient outcomes.

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Peritoneal metastases (PM) in colorectal cancer (CRC) portend a poor prognosis. We sought to elucidate molecular features differentiating primary tumors (PTs) from PMs and actionable targets facilitating transcoelomic dissemination and progression.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We performed multi-omic profiling of 227 samples from 136 patients, including 56 primary tumor (PT) and 120 synchronous PMs comprising 34 matched PT-PM pairs. Whole exome, and bulk RNA-seq analysis was conducted to identify underlying genomic aberrations and transcriptomic differences between primary and peritoneal lesions. We spatially characterized the microenvironment of tumor-stroma compartments and studied the roles of stromal phenotypes in promulgating tumorigenesis.


RESULTS
Whole exome sequencing found genomic alterations and clonality patterns between PTs and PMs remain broadly similar. Transcriptomic profiles however, suggest a transition as tumors reach the peritoneum towards a more mesenchymal tumor profile and fibrotic tumor microenvironment. Applying spatial profiling, we identify a fibro-collagenous and immune-infiltrated stromal phenotype (stromal cluster [SC] 2) characterized by increased cancer-associated fibroblasts, memory B cells, M2 macrophages and T-cell exhaustion. These findings were orthogonally validated by multiplex immunohistochemistry. Patients with SC2 stroma had poorer survival and were characterized by high SERPINE-1 (PAI-1) expression. PM in patients with SC2 stroma were associated with enriched oncogenic pathways such as TGF-β. PAI-1 inhibition of CRC PM cell-lines with a novel biologic demonstrated reduced IL2-STAT5 and TGF-β pathways and cell death.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings unveil distinctive and actionable molecular signatures, offering deeper insights into the intricate crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal microenvironments enabling PM in CRC.">

 Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a breast cancer subtype that manifests fast disease progression and very poor overall survival. Despite initial response to standard of care, development of therapy resistance remains the major challenge in TNBC clinical management. Delineating the mechanisms underlying resistance development has been impeded by the still unknown cell population of origin and lack of longitudinal molecular profiling. To investigate this question, we applied a CRISPR based lineage tracing system into TNBC cell lines. Longitudinal samples from an Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC), Sacituzumab Govitican sensitive to resistance were collected in vitro via stepwise drug dose escalation and in vivo via xnenograft serial transplantation. We leveraged cellular barcoding with single cell multiome from 10X genomics to simultaneously capture clonal identity, accessible chromatin and gene expression and hence, directly linked lineage with functional cell states. Preliminary results suggest that TNBC cells adopted distinct cell states shortly after drug exposure with characteristics including upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, stemness markers and downregulation of immune related pathways. Clonal level analysis revealed only a subset of clones survived initial treatment and are enriched in specific “primed” cell states. Next, we will construct single cell lineage trees and quantify clonal dynamics and cell state transition rates. We will identify and validate regulators of cellular plasticity and explore if potential drug combinations will prevent emergence of resistance cell state. Overall, this study will build a comprehensive map of the phenotypic trajectory towards chemotherapy resistance and pinpoints biomarkers of therapy response in triple negative breast cancer.

 Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with castration-resistant metastatic disease posing significant therapeutic challenges. The tumor microenvironment, particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), plays a crucial role in cancer development and in its progression to an aggressive and lethal stage. Previously, we identified a specific CAF subtype expressing fibroblast activation protein and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (FAP+/PDGFRβ+) as a strong predictor of poor patient prognosis, associated with PTEN loss and PI3K/pAKT activation in adjacent tumor cells. This study aimed to functionally characterize and pharmacologically inhibit this lethal cancer-stroma interaction phenotype. We first developed a 3D co-culture system using patient-derived primary CAFs and human PCa cells that recapitulates the lethal tumor microenvironment phenotype ex vivo and in vitro, providing robust models for functional studies. Utilizing 96-plex single-cell RNA sequencing with antibody barcoding of live cells, we analyzed the transcriptomic landscape of primary CAFs and assessed the impact of mono- and co-culture conditions on both cell types. Each patient-derived CAF model possessed a unique transcriptional profile, indicating patient-specific CAF characteristics. In 3D co-culture with PCa cells, CAFs exhibited upregulation of FAP and degradome genes, suggesting cancer-induced reprogramming of CAFs to remodel the extracellular matrix and support malignant progression. Concurrently, co-cultured CAFs induced pAKT upregulation in PCa cells, implicating stromal cells in promoting cancer cell proliferation. Hence, we functionally confirmed reciprocal cancer-stroma interactions in co-cultured models, mirroring changes seen in human tumor tissues of aggressive prostate cancers. To investigate potential therapeutic interventions, we applied a 96-plex single-cell pharmacotranscriptomic platform to evaluate drug responses using a library of 30 cancer drugs and key pathway inhibitors. Our findings indicate that dual inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling in cancer cells and stromal signaling in CAFs could pave the way for combinatorial therapies targeting the reciprocal interactions between PCa cells and CAFs. This approach highlights the opportunity to develop precision cancer medicine strategies aimed at disrupting critical cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment in a tailored fashion.

 Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated malignancy characterized by a dense lymphocyte infiltrate and a complex tumor microenvironment (TME). This heterogenous ecosystem influences tumor progression, immune evasion and the variable treatment outcomes observed in NPC patients. Conventional approaches such as bulk RNA sequencing lack the resolution to capture the complex heterogeneity of the TME. Spatial transcriptomics allows us to uncover the heterogeneity and cellular interactions at a single-cell resolution, providing insights into the tumor biology of NPC.



 Recent formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) NPC tissue samples were selected for analysis with the NanoString CosMx Spatial Molecular Imaging platform. Quality control, dimension reduction and unsupervised clustering at a resolution of 0.6 using the Louvain/Leiden algorithm were performed using Seurat package (v5.1.0). Cluster level annotation was performed using the singleR package using the human primary cell atlas reference. Cell type identities were validated by comparing cluster specific marker genes with canonical markers of known cell types.



 Six NPC tissue biopsies were fully interrogated comprising 254 ROIs. Post-filtering, 162, 290 cells were examined. A total of 7 clusters were identified, broadly comprising immune, stromal and epithelial cells. Tumor composition was heterogenous (B cell 4.68-50.4%, T cell 0.74-8.78%, endothelial cells 0.91-3.66%, epithelial cells 28.5-66.8%, fibroblasts 1.16%-23.9%, macrophages 6.43%-29.1%, pro B cell CD34+ 0.01-7.1%) despite similar clinical stages III-IV.



 We describe the single-cell spatial landscape of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, providing insights into the heterogeneity of the TME. We will evaluate epithelial - immune cell interactions, differential biological processes at the cellular level and compare them with deep gene expression profiles from our larger laser-capture microdissection mRNA-Seq cohort of patients to glean further insights.

 Cancer research has long sought to understand the complex tumor microenvironment and the molecular underpinnings of tumor progression. Traditional methods often fail to capture the spatial organization and cell-cell interactions within tumors. The CosMx® Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) with its CosMx Whole Transcriptome (WTX) panel offers a transformative solution, providing spatially resolved, single-cell transcriptomics with nanometer-scale precision. This platform enables the mapping of RNA molecules within their native tissue context, which is essential for uncovering critical biological insights related to cancer cell behavior, tumor microenvironment interactions, and therapeutic responses.
 We developed and optimized a tailored protocol for in vitro cell-based assays using the CosMx WTX platform. Key steps, including permeabilization and enzymatic digestion, were fine-tuned to preserve RNA integrity and cellular morphology, ensuring high-quality transcript detection. Cancer cell lines, U2OS (osteosarcoma) and SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma), were cultured and analyzed using CosMx WTX to map the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts. The data were compared to bulk RNA-seq results to validate reproducibility and accuracy. The assay’s spatial resolution allows for precise mapping of individual RNA molecules within their spatial context, facilitating phenotype-associated spatial transcriptomics.
 In our analysis, the CosMx WTX platform successfully quantified approximately 7,300 transcripts per cell in U2OS cells and 1,900 transcripts per cell in SH-SY5Y cells, showing high reproducibility and strong agreement with bulk RNA-seq data. This high-throughput capability allows for robust transcriptomic profiling of diverse cancer cell types. By correlating gene expression data with morphological and functional phenotypes, we were able to visualize the spatial organization of transcripts within cells. The platform’s nanometer-scale resolution also supports mapping of cancer organoids, offering insights into intratumoral heterogeneity, treatment resistance, and metastatic processes.
 The CosMx WTX cell-based assay represents a significant advancement in spatially resolved transcriptomics. By enabling high-resolution analyses, this platform provides valuable insights into cancer biology and offers a powerful tool for drug screening and companion diagnostic development. The integration of spatial transcriptomics with protein-level data holds the potential to transform our approach to cancer diagnostics and therapy, advancing precision medicine and improving patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Background Single-cell transcriptomics has transformed our understanding of cellular diversity, yet noise from technical artifacts and low-quality cells can obscure key biological signals. A common practice is filtering out cells with a high percentage of mitochondrial RNA counts (pctMT), typically indicative of cell death. However, commonly used filtering thresholds, primarily derived from studies on healthy tissues, may be overly stringent for malignant cells, which often naturally exhibit higher baseline mitochondrial gene expression. Results We examine nine public single-cell RNA-seq datasets from various cancers, including 441,445 cells from 134 patients, and public spatial transcriptomics data, assessing the viability of malignant cells with high pctMT. Our analysis reveals that malignant cells exhibit significantly higher pctMT than nonmalignant cells, without a notable increase in dissociation-induced stress scores. Malignant cells with high pctMT show metabolic dysregulation, including increased xenobiotic metabolism, relevant to therapeutic response. Analysis of pctMT in cancer cell lines further reveals links to drug resistance. We also observe associations between pctMT and malignant cell transcriptional heterogeneity, as well as patient clinical features. Conclusions This study provides insights into the functional characteristics of malignant cells with elevated pctMT, challenging current quality control practices in tumor single-cell RNA-seq analyses and offering potential improvements in data interpretation for future cancer studies.

 Neuroblastoma (NB) is a tumor of the sympathetic nervous system and is the most common extracranial solid malignancy in children. Patients with high-risk NB have much poorer outcomes compared with patients with low- and intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. These striking differences in clinical outcomes led us to investigate how the tumor microenvironment (TME) differs between high-risk and low-risk NB patients. We examined the cancerous and non-cancerous cells, along with other components, in the TME to determine their potential to either promote or suppress tumor growth, and to determine their association with a specific tissue spatial organization.



 In this study, we profiled 27 pediatric NB patients (n = 14 high-risk and 13 low-risk samples) using GeoMx DSP Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) (Nanostring Technologies) and Phenocycler Fusion (Akoya Biosciences). We analyzed a total of 67 regions of interest (ROIs) using spatial transcriptomics, guided by fluorescent markers (CD45, Synaptophysin, CD56, and DAPI). ROIs were segmented into tumor regions (CD56+Synaptophysin+CD45-) and TME regions (CD45+CD56-). We conducted spatial proteomics to phenotype cells, map their locations, and assess functional states by profiling 53 markers. This 53-plex protein panel enabled us to identify various cell types within the NB TME, covering relevant lineages (tumor, lymphoid, myeloid, and stromal), subtypes (e.g., CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B cells, macrophages and neutrophils), and functional states (e.g., Ki67 and PD-1). Spatially resolved signatures in the NB identified characteristics of cellular neighborhoods that are linked to NB patients’ survival outcomes.



 Within the tumor regions, we identified an upregulation of the glutathione metabolism pathways that are involved in the suppression of ferroptosis in high-risk NB tumors, which could be targeted with GPX4 inhibitors. We also discovered that NB with macrophage-rich and stroma-secluded immune cell neighborhoods had worse outcomes. Stroma-secluded immune cells were more frequent in high-risk NB, which may contribute to the resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy and overall survival of patients with high-risk NB.



 Our study highlights the need to combine the genomic profile of NB TME with spatially defined cellular neighborhoods to better understand tumor aggressiveness. Considering the upregulation of ferroptosis suppressive pathways and the macrophage-rich neighborhood in high-risk NB, our findings suggest that inducing ferroptosis with GPX4 inhibitors might be a promising therapy for high-risk NB. Overall, our study revealed key genes and pathways in high-risk NB and provides a new therapeutic avenue for patients with high-risk NB. This hypothesis is currently being investigated in our lab using animal models.

 Tumor immune microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity, shaped by diverse immune and stromal cells, significantly influences tumor metastasis, yet the specific immune ecotypes involved and their relationship to intra-tumor heterogeneity remain unclear. In this study, we present a comprehensive spatial and cellular multi-omics analysis of 44 primary and 54 lung metastatic lesions from 34 HCC patients. By integrating public single-cell RNA sequencing data from 187, 290 tumor cells across 146 HCC cases, we define HCC cellular states and uncover their organization in high-dimensional spatial expression profiles from paired HCC primary and metastatic lung lesions. Our integrated analysis, incorporating data with three independent cohorts, uncovers three pro-metastatic modules—Cell cycle(G2/M), Cellular Stress and Hypoxia —that contribute to early HCC lung metastasis. Notably, the first two modules are specific to lung metastasis, while the latter one is common across all extrahepatic organs. We show how tumor cells with distinct modules interact with various immune cell types, facilitating metastasis through different mechanisms. Additionally, these tumor cells form multi-layered structures of varying sizes, with specific state pairs preferentially clustering across multiple scales, all within a 55 µm limit. In vivo studies further reveal that interactions between G2/M-high tumor cells and Angio-macrophages and T3-neutrophils accelerate lung dissemination. Treatment with the G2/M inhibitor paclitaxel effectively disrupts this process, reducing metastasis. These findings provide critical insights into how tumor cell heterogeneity reshapes the TME to drive metastasis, underscoring the importance of spatially informed features for personalized cancer therapies. Our work emphasizes the potential of tailored strategies to prevent and manage metastasis based on tumor-immune interactions.

 Multicellular programs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) drive cancer pathogenesis and response to therapy but remain challenging to identify and profile clinically. Here, we present Spatial EcoTyper, a multimodal machine learning framework for large-scale profiling of spatially dependent cell states and multicellular ecosystems, termed spatial ecotypes (SEs).



 and Findings: By integrating five million single-cell and spot-level spatial transcriptomes from 10 diverse human neoplasms, including carcinomas and melanomas, we identified a rich tapestry of conserved regional plasticity across nine TME cell types. We then applied Spatial EcoTyper to deeply dissect these data, revealing nine novel SEs with broad conservation - each with unique biology, TME cell states, geospatial features, and clinical outcome associations. SEs were linked to specific biogeographic domains, including the tumor core, margin, and adjacent stroma, and were remarkably well-validated in 235 held-out tumor samples profiled by either single-cell RNA sequencing, sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (10x Visium), or high-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (Vizgen MERSCOPE and NanoString CosMx). By deconvolving SEs from over 1,200 bulk tumor RNA-seq profiles, we discovered striking associations between SE levels and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), outperforming nearly 40 potential correlates of ICI response, including previously described signatures of tertiary lymphoid structures and tumor tissue PD-L1 expression. Notably, baseline levels of a proinflammatory SE - localized to the tumor core and defined by a hub of unique T cell, macrophage, fibroblast, and endothelial cell states - strongly forecasted ICI benefit, while another SE - localized to the tumor margin and defined by myofibroblast and hypoxia-associated endothelial cell states - portended ICI resistance.



 Our data reveal fundamental units of TME organization and demonstrate a platform for large-scale profiling of spatial cellular ecosystems in any tissue, with implications for improved forecasting of immunotherapy response and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy, with over 1.85 million new cases and 850, 000 deaths annually. Significant intratumoral heterogeneity in CRC contributes to recurrence, chemotherapy resistance, and poor prognosis.
 This study aimed to explore the spatial distribution of subtype clones and the diversity of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which are not captured by the traditional gene expression-based CMS classification. Additionally, it sought to investigate cancer trajectories and their contributions to metastatic phenotypes using spatial transcriptomics (ST).



 Spatial analysis was performed using public 10X Genomics Visium data from 4 CRC and 4 CRC-liver metastasis (CRC-LM) patients (GSE226997, GSE217414). Cell-type deconvolution utilized single-cell RNA-seq datasets (GSE178318, GSE132465). Copy number alterations (CNA) were inferred, and subclone development trajectories were modeled using inferCNV, DPT, and PAGA analyses. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses, expression score calculations, and correlation analyses were conducted using ClusterProfiler, AddModuleScore, and statistical methods. A Wilcoxon test with an adjusted p-value < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.



 Distinct CRC and CRC-LM subclones were identified through CNA inference, revealing spatially segregated CNA clusters. These included malignant subclones and boundary-associated clusters, characterized by varying proportions of differentiation and mesenchymal traits. Immune-related signaling pathways demonstrated differential activation, with increased MAPK, JAK-STAT, and TNFα-NFκB in specific regions and elevated WNT, VEGF signaling, MYC, and E2F4 in others. Certain subclones also showed enrichment of SPP1+ macrophages and myofibroblasts, indicating diverse invasive characteristics. Evolutionary trajectories of subclones, inferred through hierarchical trees, revealed CSC features and a common ancestral clone. Progression toward malignancy was associated with enhanced pathway activity linked to critical biological processes. In CRC-LM, subclones were categorized by TAM subtypes, with one subtype displaying significantly elevated SPP1 expression compared to primary CRC. Immune-related features were reduced in metastatic tissues, reflecting a less immunogenic TME.



 Intratumoral heterogeneity in CRC evolves from a single common ancestral clone into distinct progression states, resulting in spatially unique TMEs. Understanding the interactions between clones across different progression states offers valuable insights into disease dynamics and therapeutic opportunities.

        <tr id="Objective The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in tumor progression. Recent advancements in single-cell sequencing technology have identified Tc17 cells, a newfound subset of CD8+ T cells with a phenotype similar to Th17, within the gastric cancer (GC) microenvironment. However, the role of Tc17 cells are unclear. Materials and method We collected 296,879 cells from the single-cell sequencing data of 65 GC samples, along with spatial transcriptomic data from 10 GC samples, to further explore the role of Tc17 cells. Multicolor immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the presence of Tc17 cells in the GC TME. SCENIC analysis was performed to identify the specific transcription factors of Tc17. Pseudotime analysis of T cells was conducted to decipher the differentiation trajectory of Tc17. Additionally, cell-cell interaction analysis revealed the interactions between Tc17 cells and tumor cells. Finally, functional validation through CCK-8 proliferation assays, wound Healing assays, and transwell assays conclusively demonstrated the tumor-promoting effects of IL-17A and IL-26 on gastric tumor cells. Results Our results indicate that Tc17 cells are absent from blood and exclusively found in tissues, with greater enrichment in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. Among CD8+ T cells, Tc17 exhibits the weakest cytotoxic capacity and the highest anti-inflammatory profile, suggesting reduced tumor-killing ability. Pseudotime analysis revealed that Tc17 cells ultimately progress towards a state of exhaustion, losing their capacity to eliminate tumor cells. Survival analysis further correlates the presence of Tc17 cells with poor prognosis. Notably, a robust interaction between Tc17 cells and tumor cells was observed in GC. We found that tumor cells can recruit Tc17 cells via the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis, this finding was validated on spatial transcriptome data. And in turn, Tc17 cells may promote tumor progression by secreting IL-17A and IL-26, as functionally corroborated by CCK-8 Assay, wound healing, and transwell assay in vitro. Conclusions These findings reveal the immunosuppressive role of Tc17 cells in gastric cancer, provide a new perspective for understanding the immunosuppressive mechanism of the gastric cancer tumor microenvironment, and provide a potential target for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies">

 Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are frequently observed in various solid tumors, where they play a pivotal role in regulating anti-tumor immune responses. Despite their importance, our understanding of TLS and their interactions with cancer cells within complex tissue environments remains limited. Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology offer new possibilities for investigating the spatial and phenotypic heterogeneity of TLS.
 We developed TLSphenotyper, a computational framework for automatic TLS segmentation, labeling, extraction, and comprehensive profiling of TLS using spot-level ST data. It enables reproducible and efficient large-scale analysis of TLS. To accurately map TLS and characterize their cellular composition, we created a robust TLS-specific gene signature and enhanced the resolution of spot-level ST data to near-single-cell resolution. TLSphenotyper computes cell type-specific gene signature scores to generate a detailed cell type probability map across the tissue section. This map facilitates segmentation of key cellular components within TLS, enabling precise spatial mapping and colocalization analysis of major cell types and their transcriptomic states. Additionally, TLSphenotyper automatically analyzes and classifies TLSs based on their maturation stages, offering insights into their phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. Its accuracy and precision were validated using single-cell ST data generated from adjacent tissue sections. Further benchmarking against established deconvolution methods demonstrated superior accuracy and granularity in spatial cell type inference, cell organization and co-location analysis within TLS regions.
 To further investigate TLS and their interactions with cancer cells in a pan-cancer setting, we curated a comprehensive dataset of publicly available and in-house spot-level ST data, encompassing 340 tissue sections from 12 distinct cancer types. This represents the largest collection of ST data on human cancer assembled to date. Using TLSphenotyper, we identified and characterized 695 TLSs across 340 tissues. Our analysis revealed substantial variation in TLS presence, size, location, density, cellular composition, and maturation stage across cancer types. TLSs at different maturation stages exhibited distinct transcriptomic profiles. Notably, cancer cells in proximity to TLS demonstrated significantly different activity across key signaling pathways compared to those farther away, suggesting that TLS interaction can shape cancer cell expression profiles and cellular states. Additionally, patients classified based on the maturation stages of TLS demonstrated distinct survival outcomes. Together, this study provides novel insights into the spatial dynamics and phenotypic heterogeneity of TLS, identifies potential targets for modulating TLS, and establishes a valuable resource for the research community.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Glioblastoma (GB), particularly IDH-wildtype, is the most aggressive brain malignancy with a dismal prognosis. Despite advances in molecular profiling, the complexity of its tumor microenvironment and spatial organization remains poorly understood. This study aimed to create a comprehensive single-cell and spatial atlas of GB to unravel its cellular heterogeneity, spatial architecture, and clinical relevance.


METHODS
We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data from 26 datasets, encompassing over 1.1 million cells from 240 patients, to construct GBmap, a harmonized single-cell atlas. High-resolution spatial transcriptomics was employed to map the spatial organization of GB tissues. We developed the Tumor Structure Score (TSS) to quantify tumor organization and correlated it with patient outcomes.


RESULTS
We showcase the applications of GBmap for reference mapping, transfer learning, and biological discoveries. GBmap revealed extensive cellular heterogeneity, identifying rare populations such as tumor-associated neutrophils and homeostatic microglia. Spatial analysis uncovered seven distinct tumor niches, with hypoxia-dependent niches strongly associated with poor prognosis. The TSS demonstrated that highly organized tumors, characterized by well-defined vasculature and hypoxic niches, correlated with worse survival outcomes.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides a comprehensive resource for understanding glioblastoma heterogeneity and spatial organization. GBmap and the TSS provide an integrative view of tumor architecture in GB, highlighting hypoxia-driven niches that may represent avenues for further investigation. Our resource can facilitate exploratory analyses and hypothesis generation to better understand disease progression.">

 Background:
 Over the last decade, immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, offering transformative outcomes for many patients. However, its effectiveness in treating solid tumors remains limited due to challenges such as T cell exhaustion, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), lack of tumor-specific antigens and a complex immune landscape. Solid tumors also induce systemic immune changes that evolve dynamically with tumor progression. To improve patient outcome, it is essential to understand the interplay between localized and systemic immune responses.
 Methods:
 To address these challenges, we employed an integrative approach leveraging CyTOF and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) technologies. Matched samples, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), tumor-derived cells (TDCs) and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues from cancer patients, were analyzed. A custom CyTOF panel with over 40 markers was designed to profile immune subsets, checkpoint molecules, cytokines and transcription factors. Samples were barcoded, stained and analyzed using a CyTOF XT system. For spatial immune profiling, FFPE tumor tissues were stained with a 40-plus-marker IMC panel to characterize immune, stromal and tumor cells and assess immune activation states. Data was acquired with the Hyperion XTi Imaging System, enabling high-resolution imaging of tumor microenvironments.
 Results:
 CyTOF analysis revealed heterogeneity in T cell exhaustion and activation profiles in PBMCs and TDCs, highlighting the functional diversity of immune responses. IMC technology provided spatial insights into immune cell interactions within the TME, identifying distinct patterns of immune infiltration and congregation around tumor cells and stromal elements. Comparative analysis of CyTOF and IMC data uncovered shared and divergent phenotypes between peripheral and tumor-resident immune compartments, identifying biomarkers that link systemic immune profiles with TME dynamics.
 Conclusions:
 These findings offer invaluable insights into the immunological mechanisms driving antitumor responses. By integrating functional and spatial immune profiling, our approach identifies predictive biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets, guiding the development of personalized immunotherapies. This work highlights the importance of understanding systemic and localized immune responses to improve cancer treatment outcomes and optimize treatment strategies. For Research Use Only.

 Recent advances have shed light on the molecular heterogeneity of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), yet the spatial organizations and cellular interactions in tumor immune microenvironment remain to be elucidated. Here, we employed co-detection by indexing (CODEX) and multi-omics profiling to delineate the spatial landscape for 165 SCLC patients, generating 267 high-dimensional images encompassing over 9.3 million cells. Integrating CODEX and genomic data revealed a multi-positive tumor cell neighborhood within ASCL1+ (SCLC-A) subtype, characterized by high SLFN11 expression and associated with poor prognosis. We further developed a cell colony detection algorithm (ColonyMap) and revealed a spatially assembled immune niche consisting of antitumoral macrophages, CD8+ T cells and natural killer T cells (MT2) which highly correlated with superior survival, and predicted improving immunotherapy response in an independent cohort. This study serves as a valuable resource to study SCLC spatial heterogeneity and offers insights into potential patient stratification and personalized treatments.

        <tr id="Fibroblasts play essential roles in cancer progression, exhibiting activation states that can either promote or inhibit tumor growth. Understanding these differential activation states is critical for targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME) in cancer therapy. However, traditional molecular markers used to identify cancer-associated fibroblasts are limited by their co-expression across multiple fibroblast subtypes, making it difficult to distinguish specific activation states. Morphological and motility characteristics of fibroblasts reflect their underlying gene expression patterns and activation states, making these features valuable descriptors of fibroblast behavior. This study proposes an artificial intelligence-based classification framework to identify and characterize differentially activated fibroblasts by analyzing their morphodynamic and motile features. We extract these features from label-free live-cell imaging data of fibroblasts co-cultured with breast cancer cell lines using deep learning and machine learning algorithms. Our findings show that morphodynamic and motile features offer robust insights into fibroblast activation states, complementing molecular markers and overcoming their limitations. This biophysical state-based cellular classification framework provides a novel, comprehensive approach for characterizing fibroblast activation, with significant potential for advancing our understanding of the TME and informing targeted cancer therapies.">

 Tumor progression and metastasis is driven by interplays between cancer cells and their surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME). Investigating the spatiotemporal transcriptomic profile of primary and metastatic tumors sheds light on how the differences in spatial architecture shape the TME and promote tumor metastasis. Here, we profiled three primary and three lung metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) samples using the CosMx platform, which provides a 999-gene transcriptome with spatial coordinates. After cell segmentation and annotation, we further incorporate the cellular context and spatial information to identify niches by grouping the cells with similar neighboring cells. Cell-cell communication and architecture were analyzed to understand the spatial organization in primary and metastatic ccRCC. From niche analysis, 12 distinctive niches were identified, including cancer, stroma, alveolar, tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS), and mast niches, formed by 25 different cell types. Analyzing cancer niches, we found that the metastatic TME is much more immunosuppressive compared to the TME in primary ccRCC. There is a higher infiltration of exhausted T cells, Treg and M2-like macrophages in metastases. Moreover, the fibroblasts in metastases have higher expression of VEGF and metalloproteinases, which led to angiogenesis and worse prognosis. Architecture analysis showed that lung metastatic ccRCC cells, surrounded by a stromal barrier, are not directly interacting with tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TILs), whereas primary ccRCC cells interact more with TILs. Moreover, compared to the TLSs in primary ccRCC, the ones in metastases showed features of dysfunction, which was correlated with a worse prognosis. Our results show the impact of spatial architecture on primary and metastatic ccRCC, as well as the relation between spatial organization of the cellular context and cell-cell communication. In addition, it suggests that immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are essential components of the ccRCC TME. Their interaction constitutes a major factor not only for tumor progression but also limiting therapy response in metastatic ccRCC.

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BRCA) is a complex disease influenced by the tumor microenvironment, where interactions between immune cells and cancer cells play a crucial role in tumor progression and response to therapy. Understanding the intricacies of these interactions requires detailed analysis at the single-cell level, enabling the identification of specific immune cell subpopulations and their functional roles within the tumor milieu. This study comprehensively analyzed immune cell subpopulations and macrophage subtypes in BRCA using single-cell RNA sequencing technology and various computational tools. Initially, Sc-Type software accurately identified and annotated immune cell subpopulations, followed by CNV analysis using infercnv software, revealing significant CNV variations in epithelial cells. Subsequently, macrophages were re-clustered into 5 clusters, and their biological significance and functional features were assessed. CellChat analysis elucidated potential interactions between macrophage subtypes and BRCA cells, primarily through SPP1-CD44 and LGALS9-CD44 signaling networks. Additionally, CytoTRACE and Monocle were employed to analyze cellular plasticity and differentiation trajectories of macrophage subtypes. Furthermore, efferocytosis-related gene set scoring, transcription factor analysis, and risk score development were conducted, followed by immune infiltration and tumor mutation burden analysis, revealing increased immune infiltration and higher TMB levels in the high-risk group. These findings offer crucial insights into the interaction mechanisms of immune cells and macrophage subtypes within the BRCA tumor microenvironment, aiding in the understanding of tumor progression and therapeutic interventions.">

 Prostate cancer is marked by extensive cellular diversity within its tumor microenvironment (TME), significantly impacting disease progression and responses to treatment. The study aims to dissect this heterogeneity at the single-cell level, identify distinct subpopulations within key cell types such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and T lymphocytes, and uncover potential therapeutic targets.



 We analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data from 16 prostate cancer samples, which included over 170, 000 cells. Initially, we performed data integration and normalization using Reciprocal Principal Component Analysis (R-PCA) to mitigate batch effects and enhance data quality. For dimensionality reduction, both PCA and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) were applied, allowing us to visualize and identify patterns in the high-dimensional dataset. Clustering of cells was conducted using the k-means algorithm to categorize cells into distinct clusters based on their gene expression profiles. Finally, cell type classification within these clusters was achieved using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), enabling the precise identification of cellular identities and states based on their molecular signatures.



 Our comprehensive analysis unveiled a remarkable diversity among the circulating tumor cells (CTCs) within the Taiwanese prostate cancer tumor microenvironment. Specifically, we identified four distinct CTC clusters, each infused with different cellular components that suggest unique roles in tumor dynamics. CTC1 is comprised purely of epithelial cells, presenting a classical phenotype of circulating tumor cells, which underscores the conventional understanding of CTCs in cancer dissemination. Meanwhile, CTC2 is characterized by an infusion with N1 neutrophils, highlighting its potential role in promoting inflammatory responses that could affect tumor growth and patient prognosis. In contrast, CTC3 includes an infusion with N2 neutrophils, indicating a possible contribution to enhanced tumor progression and metastatic potential, thereby suggesting a target for therapeutic intervention to curb tumor spread. Lastly, CTC4 is infused with plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are known for their role in immune suppression, thereby aiding the tumor in evading immune surveillance.



 This study underscores the utility of single-cell technologies in uncovering the complex cellular interactions within prostate cancer. By detailing the unique profiles of CTC subclusters and their associations with specific immune cells, our research provides novel insights into the tumor microenvironment and identifies new targets for immunotherapy. Future research will focus on validating these markers and integrating broader genomic data to refine treatment approaches and enhance patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Gastric cancer (GC) exhibits high heterogeneity that relies on the oncogenic properties of cancer cells and multicellular interactions in the tumour microenvironment. However, the heterogeneity of GC and their molecular characteristics are still largely unexplored. Methods We employed single‐cell and spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively map the intra‐tumoural heterogeneity within GC. Additionally, in vitro experiments, clinical sample analyses, and patient‐derived organoid models (PDOs) were conducted to validate the key interaction patterns between tumor cells and stromal cells. Results Seven robust meta‐programs (MP1–MP7) in GC were defined with distinct biological significance and spatial distributions. MP3 and MP4 were intimately associated with distinct CD8 T cells skewed toward a cytotoxic or exhaustion state, while MP7, characterised by the highest degree of malignancy, harboured an immune lockdown microenvironment around it and spatially associated with myofibroblasts (myCAFs). Notably, we clarified the interplay between the MP7 and myCAFs, where MP7 induces the chemotactic migration of fibroblasts and promoting their transformation into myCAFs via GDF15/TGFBR2, and in turn, myCAFs‐derived RSPO3 up‐regulates EGR1 to promote the transformation to MP7 in GC cells and human PDOs. Ultimately, the accumulation of myCAFs around MP7 led to fewer infiltration of CD8 T cells, resulting an immune‐deprived microenvironment and the diminished efficacy of immunotherapy. Additionally, based on the gene expression signatures of MP7 GC cells, we predicted specific drugs and verified more potent inhibitory effects of Taselisib and Lapatinib for MP7 GC cells than conventional drugs at the same concentration. Conclusion Taken together, these results deepened the understanding of GC heterogeneity and paved the way for novel therapeutic strategies by targeting MP7 GC cells and their interaction loop with myCAFs in GC treatment. Key points Seven robust meta‐programs (MP1‐MP7) were identified in gastric cancer. MP7 was strongly correlated with cancer metastasis and poor survival of gastric cancer patients. MP7 promoted fibroblast transformation into myCAFs via GDF15/TGFBR2, creating an immune lockdown microenvironment. MyCAFs induced MP7 transformation via the RSPO3/EGR1 pathway, promoting gastric cancer cell migration. Taselisib and Lapatinib were potent inhibitors of MP7 GC cells.">

 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is an essential component of cancer biology. TME-derived measures such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes proportions (TILs) and tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) are used to evaluate TME composition. We leveraged spatial transcriptomics (ST) data from colon tumors to deconvolve cell-type populations and developed a deep learning (DL) algorithm to infer local ST-derived TIL and TSR estimates reflecting TME heterogeneity from held-out H&E whole slide images (WSIs). A total of 44 colon tumors surgical sections were profiled using matched H&E WSI and Visium ST, with 10 patients profiled for single-cell RNASeq. A pathologist annotated tumor microarchitecture within each slide. A total of 284,770 512x512 pixel2 image patches were extracted and paired with corresponding Visium ST spots. Using SCANVI, cell type labels from the Human colon cancer atlas (c295) were lifted over to our in-house scRNASeq data. Cells were mapped spatially to estimate spot-level cell-type proportions using Cell2Location (C2L). Cell-type mapping was validated through human-in-the-loop (HITL) testing, where 512-pixel image crops around 400 randomly selected spots were annotated at each pixel. Spot-level TIL/TSR measures were estimated using cell-type proportions from the C2L-transformed ST data and proportion of pixels within each patch assigned to lymphocytes and tumor. Next, Virchow, a state-of-the-art deep learning pathology foundation model, was used to extract spot-level histological features- a Random Forest model was trained on spot-level features to infer cell-type proportions. Spot-level performance for cell-type mapping (evaluated through HITL) and cell-type proportion inference from histology was measured using the area under the curve (AUC) on a held-out test set of 9 patients. HITL tests demonstrated high agreement between H/ST-TIL (AUC=0.71; 95% CI: [0.60-0.82]) and H/ST-TSR (AUC=0.86; 95% CI: [0.81-0.92]). DL spot-level cell-type deconvolution within tumor-only slide regions achieved a macro-averaged AUC of 0.812 (Tumor: 0.85, Mesenchymal: 0.91, Lymphocytes: 0.79, Monocytes: 0.76, Mast: 0.79, Plasma: 0.78). Previous work inferred spatial expression patterns across broader regions, reporting cell-type AUCs of Tumor: 0.93, Mesenchymal: 0.82, Lymphocytes: 0.76, Monocytes: 0.74, and Mast: 0.91. Our results show that DL can infer ST-labeled cell types from H&E WSI, capturing TME features beyond tissue architecture. HITL testing demonstrated strong concordance between derived spot-level ST-TSR/TIL metrics with their histology-based counterparts (H-TSR/TIL), with utility for pathologist validation of spatially mapped cell-type data. This study highlights future potential of DL to capture spatial distribution of TME measures as prognostic biomarkers through ST inference from histology.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, claiming over 900, 000 lives annually. In the US, CRC disproportionately affects certain populations, with higher prevalence among racial and ethnic minorities. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in CRC progression, therapeutic response, and overall patient outcomes. However, the spatially intricate interactions within the TME that distinguish effective from ineffective tumor control remain poorly understood. Addressing these gaps is essential for enhancing our understanding of spatial heterogeneity and advancing immunotherapy development.



 To investigate these dynamics, we employed a multi-modal approach using re-engineered co-detection by indexing (CODEX) on publicly available data (Schürch et al., 2020) from 35 late-stage CRC patients. Our systematic workflow classified cells, analyzed protein expression, and spatially represented the data. Cells were grouped into three main classes—stroma, tumor, and immune—based on structural characteristics and functional roles. Protein expression analysis was conducted by integrating data for individual surface protein expression, enabling direct comparisons between the stroma, tumor, and immune classes. Through this framework, 56 protein markers were profiled to identify conserved cellular neighborhoods (CNs) that characterize the spatial and functional organization within the CRC TME.



 Protein expression analysis revealed distinct patterns across the stroma, tumor, and immune classes for the biomarkers profiled. These markers exhibited differential expression profiles across the three classes, highlighting their unique roles within the TME. For instance, immune markers such as CD3, CD8, CD68, and PD-1 showed significant variation between the tumor and immune classes, underscoring their spatial organization and functional importance within the TME. Similarly, functional markers such as MMP9 and Ki-67 demonstrated distinct expression dynamics, reflecting their roles in tumor progression and immune responses. Auxiliary markers, including cytokeratins, highlighted structural differences unique to the stroma class. These results provided a comprehensive understanding of the spatial and functional interplay between immune, tumor, and stromal components in the CRC TME.



 This study provides a deeper understanding of protein expression within the CRC TME, enhancing the classification and spatial characterization of TME. These results provide key insights into spatial heterogeneity within the TME through distinct protein expression profiles. These findings provide valuable guidance for future research in drug discovery, with the potential to significantly advance the field of precision oncology.

 Murine syngeneic tumor models are widely used tools to demonstrate efficacy and the mechanism of novel anticancer immunotherapies. Each model is likely to have a unique tumor microenvironment (TME) with immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and extracellular matrix that may reflect a variety of TME profiles in humans. Baseline characterization of tumor TME features of each model paired with therapy-based mechanistic studies can confirm pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker hypotheses and inform combination strategies. However, a comprehensive dataset of TME compositions and spatial information is unavailable. PhenoCycler is an ultrahigh-plexed spatial biology imaging platform that can detect up to 100 markers on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections at a single cell resolution using cyclic detection of DNA-conjugated antibodies. Very few publications have used Phenocycler technology to image murine FFPE tissues. In this study, we constructed a FFPE tissue microarray (TMA) block that includes 12 commonly used preclinical murine models of breast, colon, lung, pancreatic ductal, renal and bladder carcinomas with duplicate cores, and built a 29-marker panel to characterize the complexity of the TME of these models. Our data showed distinct TMEs in the different models and cell-cell interactions that differed depending on the tumor type examined. For instance, Py2T and Pan02 are cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) and macrophage enriched tumors whereas MC-38 tumors have low levels of CAF and T cell infiltration. Based on these analyses, the EMT6 tumor model, an immunocompetent triple negative mammary carcinoma with adequate extracellular matrix, was selected for an in vivo pharmacology study for a novel anti-stroma immunotherapy. Evaluation of whole tissue tumor samples from the study revealed significant increases in CD8+ T cell infiltration and a reduction of COL1A1 expression in treated tumors compared to vehicle group tumors consistent with antitumor efficacy. Our study demonstrated that ultrahigh-plexed immunofluorescence imaging is a powerful technology that can efficiently assist in vivo model selection and support biomarker discovery, especially in combination with a TMA section that can include multiple tumor models.

 Gastric cancer exhibits diverse malignant cell states that contribute to intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), a fundamental factor that drive tumor progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance. While previous single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies have provided novel insights into ITH in gastric cancer, they are often constrained by small sample sizes and limited transcriptional coverage.



 In this study, we curated, annotated, and integrated scRNA-seq datasets from 21 studies, comprising 626 samples from 316 individuals, including healthy donors and patients with precancerous lesions and gastric cancer. Within the epithelial compartment, malignant and non-malignant cells were distinguished using three complementary computational methods. To refine malignant cell subclustering, we developed a novel approach that incorporates patient-specific copy number variations, minimizing the impact of inter-patient heterogeneity on clustering analysis.



 Following rigorous quality control and data integration, unsupervised clustering analysis classified 2, 088, 266 high-quality cells into six major cell types or compartments: B cells, T cells, innate lymphoid cells, myeloid cells, stromal cells, and epithelial cells. Within the epithelial cell compartment, we identified 12 distinct malignant cell states characterized by unique expression profiles and phenotypic characteristics, such as cell proliferation capacity and lineage-specific plasticity. These cancer cell states exhibited substantial variation in the activity of hallmark cancer signaling pathways, with their presence and composition closely linked to tumor aggressiveness and clinical outcomes. Proliferative cancer cells and translationally active cancer cells predominated in intermediate tumor stages, dormant cells were prevalent in advanced stages, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) states were enriched in metastatic tumors. Additionally, we identified a malignant cell population with high expression of intestinal lineage markers in patients with signet ring cell carcinoma, and these findings were validated using spatial transcriptomic.



 This study presents a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of gastric cancer epithelial cells, providing valuable insights into transcriptional ITH. Our findings define distinct malignant cell states, elucidate their dynamics, and highlight their clinical significance, establishing a framework for understanding how these states contribute to disease progression and metastasis.

By leveraging deep molecular profiling through spatial transcriptomics integrated with single-cell RNA-sequencing from public atlases, and serum proteomic profiling, we report a case of a patient with resectable NSCLC and a solitary synchronous brain metastasis showing a complete pathologic response after chemo-immunotherapy, and a durable event-free survival. The deep profiling of the tumor immune microenvironment of both pre-treatment brain metastasis and post-treatment primary lung tumor tissues unveiled a key role of B lymphocytes at different maturation state, spanning from naïve to plasma cells, in mediating tumor eradication. Notably, the formation of several tertiary lymphoid structures in the regression bed of post-treatment primary tumor was observed, suggesting the in situ generation of high-affinity antibody and specific immune memory response. This multimodal approach paves the way for the discovery of novel biomarkers at both tissue and systemic levels, fostering improved patient stratification and guiding clinical decisions on post-surgical treatment escalation or de-escalation.">

 Novel cellular therapy has the potential to change cancer treatment. However, to design new therapies requires a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cellular dynamics that occur within the tumor. This requires a high resolution and subcellular view of cancer cells, immune cells while identifying the neighborhood architecture that exists between them. Spatial transcriptomics and spatial proteomics show subcellular information and can be used to identify cellular cell types and find spatial deviation between cells. However, there are a lack of tools to investigate cellular behaviors on an individual cell basis while integrating pathological information, limiting the future of spatial biology. We introduce CellClique, a tool that assists in dissecting TMEs using spatial transcriptomics with the Xenium platform and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stains. CellClique integrates both generative and analytical capabilities to provide a comprehensive view of TMEs. On the generative end, CellClique uses generative AI to model both gene expressions and cell-neighborhood interactions for cell annotation, gene expression prediction, and gene imputation. On the analytical end, CellClique offers a comprehensive four-way spatial analysis scheme aimed at 1) understanding the effects of neighboring cells on a target cell, 2) dissecting cancer-normal cell boundaries, 3) observing immune invasion mechanisms, and 4) exploring cellular subtypes with the TME. We applied CellClique to study the cellular landscape in lung and colon cancers using multiple different neighborhood analyses. We generated proximal (10 microns), local (60 microns), and distal neighborhoods (120 microns) for each cell within each tissue and found distinct expression profiles of tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes, which are functionally different from lymphocytes excluded from the tumor. Additionally, we discovered expression variation patterns in cancer-normal boundary cell communities with various cell compositions. These compositions changed significantly as distance from the boundary changed. We also compared lymphocytes at different stages of life by analyzing expression differences among lymphocytes classified with over 80% confidence, those with a 50% probability of being lymphocytes, and those with below 20% probability. We further compared how these neighborhoods changed between lung cancer and colon cancer and showed cancer specific spatial deviations and expression. Together, these methods paint a complex picture of the TME but also identifies numerous avenues for future discovery and molecular investigation. These new approaches will guide future cellular therapy and the development of new treatments. The future integration of AI and machine learning will continue to make a tremendous impact on spatial transcriptomics and our approach to treating disease.

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, exhibits significant cellular and molecular heterogeneity. The advent of single-cell transcriptomic methodologies has significantly disclosed its intra-tumoral cellular diversity to an unprecedented level. Interactions between cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) are crucial for cancer progression and affect how tumors respond to current therapies.



 This study aimed to utilize single-cell data to address two main objectives: (1) to dissect the heterogeneous nature of HCC tumors by identifying tumor subclones and their molecular features, key transcription factors, and implicated pathways; and (2) to explore the intricate communication between tumor cells and immune cells, with a focus on the pathways that significantly influence tumor growth and metastasis.



 The tissue samples of HCC were obtained from nine patients undergoing surgery immediately from the operation theater after resection, with informed consent. Dissociated tumor single cells were subjected to scRNA-seq by 10X Genomics platform.



 Our analysis identified seven distinct tumor subclones, validating the presence of high tumor heterogeneity. Among these, one subclone, designated as SC6, exhibited particularly distinctive molecular characteristics. Further investigation revealed that NFE2L3 exhibited the highest activity score during the TFs analysis, indicating its significant regulatory role in SC6 cluster, and was intricately associated with pathways involved in extracellular matrix organization and immune regulation. Through cellular communication analysis, we discovered that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs) exhibited the highest communication intensity with SC6 cluster when acting as the source of ligands. Further investigation revealed critical ligand-receptor pairs, including some integrin family genes functioning as receptors. This interaction suggests that these integrins may engage with ligands secreted by TAMs or DCs within the TME, potentially promoting tumor cell proliferation and migration.



 Through comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq data, we elucidated the intricate heterogeneity within HCC, identifying distinct characteristics of various tumor subclones. Our investigation revealed key transcription factors that predominate in specific subclones. Additionally, we uncovered robust intercellular communication between tumor cells and myeloid cells.

        <tr id="Gliomas, including both glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and lower-grade glioma (LGG), present a substantial challenge in neuro-oncology because of genetic heterogeneity and unsatisfactory prognosis. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of gliomas using various bioinformatics approaches to identify potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on 1327 sequencing data samples alongside their relevant clinical information sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pertaining to glioblastoma (GBM), low-grade glioma (LGG), the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CCGA) and University of California Santa Cruz Xena (UCSC Xena) datasets. These tools were employed for gene expression profiling, survival analysis, and cell communication mapping. Spatial transcriptomics revealed the localization of mesenchymal (MES)-like malignant tumors, and drug sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate responses to quinpirole and meropenem. Additionally, the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) framework was utilized to gauge the responsiveness to immunotherapy. The MES-like malignant and monocyte/macrophage (mono/macro) cell subsets showed high hallmark scores, playing key roles in the tumor microenvironment. MES-like malignant marker gene scores correlated with overall survival across datasets, whereas mono/macro marker gene scores were significant in the TCGA-LGG and CCGA datasets. Key interactions between these cell types were found, especially with CD14-ITGB2, LGALS1-CD69, and APOE-TREM2. The mono/macro cell subset demonstrated better immune therapy responsiveness, as indicated by lower TIDE scores. Spatial transcriptomics revealed that MES-like malignant tumors are predominantly localized in four distinct regions, with the marker genes CHI3L1 and ADM confirming these locations. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed differential responses of the MES-like malignant cell subset to quinpirole and meropenem. Our results offer fresh perspectives on the differential roles of MES-like malignant and monocyte/macrophage cell subsets in tumor progression and immune modulation, providing novel insights into glioma biology.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly influences cancer prognosis and therapeutic outcomes, yet its composition remains highly heterogeneous, and currently, no highly accessible, high-throughput method exists to define it. To address this complexity, the TMEclassifier, a machine-learning tool that classifies cancers into three distinct subtypes: immune Exclusive (IE), immune Suppressive (IS), and immune Activated (IA), is developed. Bulk RNA sequencing categorizes patient samples by TME subtype, and in vivo mouse model validates TME subtype differences and differential responses to immunotherapy. The IE subtype is marked by high stromal cell abundance, associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes. The IS subtype features myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration, intensifying immunosuppression. In contrast, the IA subtype, often linked to EBV/MSI, exhibits robust T-cell presence and improved immunotherapy response. Single-cell RNA sequencing is applied to explore TME cellular heterogeneity, and in vivo experiments demonstrate that targeting IL-1 counteracts immunosuppression of IS subtype and markedly improves its responsiveness to immunotherapy. TMEclassifier predictions are validated in this prospective gastric cancer cohort (TIMES-001) and other diverse cohorts. This classifier could effectively stratify patients, guiding personalized immunotherapeutic strategies to enhance precision and overcome resistance.">

        <tr id="Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest. However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data. Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the studied methods. Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major health concern, with over 150,000 new diagnoses and more than 50,000 deaths annually in the United States, underscoring an urgent need for improved screening, prognostication, disease management, and therapeutic approaches. The tumor microenvironment (TME)- comprising cancerous and immune cells interacting within the tumor's spatial architecture- plays a critical role in disease progression and treatment outcomes, reinforcing its importance as a prognostic marker for metastasis and recurrence risk. However, traditional methods for TME characterization, such as bulk transcriptomics and multiplex protein assays, lack sufficient spatial resolution. Although spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows for the high-resolution mapping of whole transcriptomes at near-cellular resolution, current ST technologies (e.g., Visium, Xenium) are limited by high costs, low throughput, and issues with reproducibility, preventing their widespread application in large-scale molecular epidemiology studies. In this study, we refined and implemented Virtual RNA Inference (VRI) to derive ST-level molecular information directly from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue images. Our VRI models were trained on the largest matched CRC ST dataset to date, comprising 45 patients and more than 300,000 Visium spots from primary tumors. Using state-of-the-art architectures (UNI, ResNet-50, ViT, and VMamba), we achieved a median Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.546 between predicted and measured spot-level expression. As validation, VRI-derived gene signatures linked to specific tissue regions (tumor, interface, submucosa, stroma, serosa, muscularis, inflammation) showed strong concordance with signatures generated via direct ST, and VRI performed accurately in estimating cell-type proportions spatially from H&E slides. In an expanded CRC cohort controlling for tumor invasiveness and clinical factors, we further identified VRI-derived gene signatures significantly associated with key prognostic outcomes, including metastasis status. Although certain tumor-related pathways are not fully captured by histology alone, our findings highlight the ability of VRI to infer a wide range of "histology-associated" biological pathways at near-cellular resolution without requiring ST profiling. Future efforts will extend this framework to expand TME phenotyping from standard H&E tissue images, with the potential to accelerate translational CRC research at scale.">

        <tr id="Spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized our understanding of tissue organization by simultaneously capturing gene expression and spatial localization within intact tissues. However, analyzing these increasingly complex datasets requires specialized expertise across computational biology, statistics, and biological context. To address this challenge, we introduce the Spatial Transcriptomics AI Agent (STAgent), an autonomous multimodal agentic AI that integrates multimodal large language models (LLMs) with specialized computational tools to transform weeks-long analysis tasks into minutes of automated processing. Unlike conventional machine learning approaches that are limited to narrow, predefined tasks, STAgent leverages the emergent capabilities of multimodal LLMs – such as flexible reasoning, contextual understanding, and cross-modal integration – which allow it to adapt to novel data, execute multi-step analyses, and generate biologically meaningful insights with minimal human input. STAgent enables autonomous deep research through integrated capabilities, including dynamic code generation for complex analytical workflows, visual reasoning for interpreting spatial patterns, real-time retrieval of relevant peer-reviewd scientific literature, and synthesis of comprehensive, actionable reports. We applied STAgent to investigate the in vivo maturation of human stem cell-derived pancreatic cells (SC-pancreas) transplanted into immunodeficient mice. We generated single-cell spatial transcriptomics data spanning multiple developmental timepoints. STAgent autonomously (1) identified the maturation of initially scattered endocrine cells into well-defined islet-like structures, with predominantly peripheral α-cells surrounding β-cell cores supported by an expanding mesenchymal network; (2) revealed strengthening endocrine-endocrine cell interactions over time and, through context-aware gene set analysis, uncovered spatially resolved biological processes driving maturation; (3) unlike traditional analytical approaches, STAgent offers mechanistic explanations of spatial patterns, contextualizing findings with relevant literatures and developing cohesive insights into human pancreatic development. This agentic approach establishes a new paradigm in spatial transcriptomics analysis by substantially lowering the expertise barrier and reducing analysis time, accelerating biological and biomedical discovery.">

 Tumor cell heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment are fundamental questions that heavily influence the process of cancer development, disease progression, and the response to treatments. Knowledge of cancer biology facilitates understanding of pharmacological effects and mechanism of action to improve clinical outcomes. Spatial transcriptomics technology, particularly Stereo-seq, makes the groundbreaking advancement in cancer research with its outstanding performance with high capture efficiency and single cell resolution. It allows scientists to visualize and analyze the complexity of tumors at an unprecedented level of detail. In this study, we mapped tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment of fresh frozen section from colorectal cancer tissue (CRC) at a single-cell resolution with Stereo-seq v1.3 kit. We identified10 cell populations using cell2location, including B cells, fibroblasts, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, macrophages, mast cells and NK cells. In situ mapping and portion analysis of cell identification revealed a B-cell dominated area which was confirmed by H&E staining of adjacent section. To comprehensively understand the immune activities, we quantified the interactions among different cell types (by StereoSite framework), revealing biologically meaningful intercellular communications mediated by GZMA-PARD3 and CCR10- CCL28 between B cells and epithelial cells. Further pathway enrichment analysis indicated cooperated molecular activities and underlying functions in CRC, which showed interaction activities significantly associated with EGF or BMP signaling pathways. Patteren recognition method identified how functional units assocatied with pathways. Take EGF pathway as an example, results revealed CD4+ T cells and macrophages may coordinated to impact EGF pathway by communication activities. Analysis in this study showed that spatial transcriptomic data at single-cell resolution is vital for exploring intercellular communications, molecular activities, and functional units by providing spatial context. Stereo-seq possess the ability to efficiently gathering evidence of mode of action and resistance mechanims by deeply mapping the spatial profiling in TME. It paves the ways for drug development by removing uncertainties and reducing time and cost. Implementation of Stereo-seq workflow could not only offer impetus to solve unmet needs in area of oncological research, but also bring new findings from lab to patients faster.

        <tr id="Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease at the clinical, population, and molecular levels. Using key molecular markers, breast cancer can be classified into at least four major intrinsic subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like or triple-negative. These subtypes are associated with distinct risk factors, clinical behaviors, treatment responses, and outcomes. Recent research highlights the importance of the breast tumor microenvironment (TME) in shaping tumor evolution and cancer progression. Both tumor and TME cells within an individual patient often exhibit substantial intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), the extent of which may impact accurate tumor classification and treatment response, but has not been well characterized especially in women of African Ancestry. The goal of this study was to comprehensively investigate ITH of intrinsic subtypes and immune TME markers in breast cancer patients from an East African population. Specifically, we employed the Nanostring GeoMxTM platform to quantify 44 key breast cancer intrinsic and immune subtyping markers in spatially defined regions of breast tumors from 31 Kenyan breast cancer patients. We found that all 31 tumors exhibited some degree of ITH, with a third of them showing substantial ITH. Cell composition (epithelial vs. stromal), spatial location of TME immune cells (tumor-leading edge, proximity to tumor or stroma), and intrinsic subtype (specifically, basal-like vs. luminal A) all contributed significantly to ITH of these markers. When comparing results to those obtained from an in-situ multiplex staining platform InSituPlex (ultivue) and bulk Nanostring nCounter RNA expression, all generated from the same set of cases, we found that intrinsic or immune subtyping by bulk approaches, which is heavily influenced by the predominant subtypes within a tumor, may lead to inaccurate classification when substantial ITH exists. Similarly, sampling-based approaches like tissue microarrays (TMAs) or region-of-interest (ROI)-based assays are also likely to be subjective to inaccurate and inconsistent measurements of immune markers due to sampling bias. In low-resource settings, in-situ assays combined with multi-region scoring may offer a more accurate yet practical alternative to bulk or single-cell assays, which are often costly and technically challenging.

 Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) exhibit significant inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity, complicating diagnosis and treatment. Our previous work demonstrated that spheroids developed from patient-derived cells and HNSCC cell lines display distinct proliferative and migratory behaviors. We classified them as hyperproliferative and hypoproliferative spheriods. To uncover the molecular basis of this functional heterogeneity, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and advanced computational tools like CellChat. Our analysis revealed key signaling pathways, cellular interactions, and surface markers defining spheroid phenotypes, offering insights into their genetic and functional diversity.



 scRNA-seq was performed on hyperproliferative and hypoproliferative spheroids derived from the UMSCC-22B cell line. Spheroids were cultured, dissociated into single cells, and subjected to high-throughput scRNA-seq. Bioinformatic analyses identified differentially expressed genes, signaling pathways, and cellular states. CellChat was employed to analyze intercellular communication networks within spheroids. Ligand-receptor interactions were modelled to identify pathways mediating cross-talk between distinct cell clusters.



 scRNA-seq revealed distinct transcriptional profiles between the two spheroids. Hyperproliferative spheroids expressed genes related to cell division and growth, while hypoproliferative spheroids expressed genes linked to migration and invasion. Pathway analysis identified differences in angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumor microenvironment interactions. Midkine signalling(MDK-SDC) through basal cells was found to be the principal contributor to the proliferative advantage in hyperproliferative spheriods, supporting their role in tumor expansion and progression. While, Desmosomal signaling (DSC2-DSG2) through keratinocytes and fibroblasts was found to play a critical role in maintaining cellular adhesion and promoting migratory capacity in hypoproliferative spheroids. TCGA data linked MDK to advanced tumor stages, poor survival, and therapy resistance, while DSG2 and DSC2 were overexpressed in metastatic tumors. These findings highlight the distinct functional states of spheroids contributing to tumor heterogeneity.



 The balance between proliferation and migration in spheroids reflects tumor heterogeneity's dual role in cancer progression. Midkine-driven hyperproliferative spheroids anchor tumor growth, while desmosome-mediated hypoproliferative spheroids drive metastasis. Targeting Midkine or modulating desmosomal remodeling could inhibit growth and prevent dissemination, enabling patient-specific therapies.

 Background:
 The tumor microenvironment (TME) of primary breast tumors (PTs) and breast-to-liver metastases shows heterogeneous infiltration and interactions between tumor, immune, and stromal cells. Hepatic metastases exhibit a more immunosuppressive TME with fewer cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) relative to PTs, which may contribute to increased tumor growth and resistance to systemic therapies. To investigate the immune cell infiltration and immune-tumor interactions in PT and liver metastases, we utilized whole transcriptome analysis and immunofluorescence-based protein expression as part of spatial TME profiling.
 Methods:
 We identified 13 chemo-naïve PTs and 3 breast-to-liver metastases. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were used for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and spatial transcriptomics (ST) profiling with the 10X Genomics Visium CytAssist and Visium HD platforms. The H&E slides were manually annotated in collaboration with a board-certified pathologist, and ST data were deconvoluted using breast-specific scRNA-sequenced references and canonical marker labeling.
 Results:
 Our analysis of the 13 PTs and 3 breast-to-liver metastases revealed significant heterogeneity in tumor clusters, immune cell infiltration, gene set enrichments, and gene signatures between primary and visceral TMEs. Unsupervised clustering of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) HER2-negative (HER2) samples demonstrated considerable intratumoral and intertumoral variability, with differences in the expression of tumor markers (EPCAM, ER, PR, ERBB2, KRT14, KRT18), hypoxia-related signatures (HIF1a), and pro-angiogenic drivers (VEGF). Breast-to-liver metastases showed higher expression of pathways involved in proliferation, angiogenesis, and anti-apoptosis compared to primary tumors. Hepatic metastases were enriched for HALLMARK gene sets related to proliferation and metabolic pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, mTORC1 signaling, E2F targets, MYC targets, G2M checkpoint, mitotic spindle, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid metabolism when compared to primary tumors. In contrast, primary tumors were enriched for immune-related pathways (TNF-α, interferon-γ, inflammatory response, IL-6 JAK/STAT3), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), myogenesis, and angiogenesis gene signatures, which are consistent with their metastatic potential. Cellular profiling of liver lesions revealed higher myeloid suppressor cells (TAMs and MDSCs): CD8
 +
 ratio with shorter cell-cell distances relative to PTs suggesting a key role in immune evasion, tumor progression, and therapeutic resistance.
 Conclusions:
 ST data from primary and metastatic breast cancer samples revealed notable tumor heterogeneity, characterized by highly active metabolic and proliferative pathways, along with a higher abundance of myeloid cells.

 Metastatic bladder cancer (mBLCA) exhibits significant heterogeneity at the genomic, transcriptomic, molecular, and epigenetic levels, contributing to challenges in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. While 75% of mBLCA cases are urothelial carcinomas, 25% show divergent differentiation with variant histological features. This work characterizes intra-patient and inter-patient heterogeneity through comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analyses of a rapid autopsy cohort of 20 patients with multiple tumors, matched normal tissue, and cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Our findings provide critical insights into tumor heterogeneity, clonal evolution, metastatic seeding, and the tumor microenvironment.



 Using bioinformatics tools, we reconstructed clonal evolution trees from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of tumors and inferred migration patterns to determine metastatic seeding. COSMIC mutational signatures were examined to correlate histological subtypes with clinical history. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) revealed cell types and transcriptional heterogeneity using the human protein atlas and known marker annotations. To investigate alterations and clonality in tumors and their matched cfDNA, we used custom methodologies to evaluate mutations, CNAs, SVs, and rearrangements.



 The clonal evolution trees and bulk RNA-seq highlight cisplatin resistance in the plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma subtype, driven by upregulation of the DNA damage response pathway. Significant mutational heterogeneity (∼20-30% subclonal) emerges in later stages of tumor evolution, potentially contributing to therapy resistance. Additionally, a substantial proportion (60-70%) of structural variants arise later in tumor progression, particularly in driver genes. snRNA-seq revealed distinct clusters of epithelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and other cell types. cfDNA analysis captured over 80% of subclonal deleterious tumor mutations in BLCA driver genes. Nucleosome profiling of cfDNA helps distinguish mBLCA from healthy samples and identify key transcription factors to differentiate between variants.



 This comprehensive study of mBLCA, leveraging a rapid autopsy dataset, uncovers critical insights into variant histologies across multiple omics layers. Integrating cfDNA analysis captures intra-patient and inter-patient tumor heterogeneity, providing a holistic view of clonal dynamics. By elucidating the patterns of clonal evolution, this work advances our understanding of tumor progression and establishes a foundation for precision therapies targeting adaptive and evolving clones.

 The limited efficacy of surgical resection and high rate of tumor recurrence in glioblastoma underscores the urgency of better understanding tumor invasion in the central nervous system. High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial genomics, efficiently identify gene expression states of rare invading cells and microenvironmental interactions. We previously described cell state heterogeneity in glioblastoma by scRNA-seq and uncovered the contribution of immune cells to the heterogeneity. Yet it is unclear whether the cell states observed in clinical specimens are implicated in invading glioblastoma cells in the brain parenchyma. We hypothesized that the distance from the primary tumor site and the local microenvironment of invading cells might affect the invasion phenotype.



 To test this hypothesis, we developed an in vivo approach with mixtures of human glioblastoma spheroid lines for mouse intracranial xenografts. We validated this multiplex method with 20 patient-derived models and profiled, by scRNA-seq, in vivo models capable of infiltrating the brain parenchyma. We then used spatial transcriptomics to explore invasion routes and distribution of the invasive programs across the brain.



 By comparing cells in the contralateral invasive site to the primary tumor, we identified a set of genes upregulated in invading glioblastoma cells, significantly enriched with NPC-like and OPC-like programs we identified previously, as well as genes not associated with the predefined states. Next, we analyzed the program expressed by cells undergoing invasion along blood vessels; the up-regulated program was enriched with AC-like and OPC-like programs. As observed with contralateral invasion, the program seen in blood vessel invasion was distinct from the previously defined states. The ST analysis highlighted this distinction and detailed the characteristics of each program. The contralateral invasion signature was associated with neuronal and myeloid-specific regions in the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast, the blood vessel invasion signature was localized to vascular regions at the periphery of the primary tumor.



 Our study found that an abundance of OPC-like cells was linked to more efficient invasion into the opposite side of the brain, suggesting that these cells might play a crucial role in distal invasion. In addition, we observed that models with a MES-like expression profile exhibit local perivascular invasion. Our comprehensive approach, coupled with high-throughput transcriptome profiling, provides a detailed blueprint of invasion potential and the functional transcriptional programs that drive GBM invasion along different anatomical routes, offering new insights for potential therapeutic strategies against glioblastoma.

 Background:
 Tumoral heterogeneity has been widely acknowledged to influence clinical outcome of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). This study investigated spatial gene profiling of different pathological subtypes of early-stage invasive LUAD with Stereo-seq transcriptomics technique. The tumor microenvironment (TME) was decoded with cellular and molecular events at perspectives of tumoral activities and immune activities.
 Methods:
 We collected spatial RNA profiles of nine Stereo-seq chips (captured area of 1 x1 cm) from 4 invasive LUAD patients. Pathologist identified histological subtypes including lepidic adenocarcinoma (LP), acinar adenocarcinoma (AC) and other invasive adenocarcinoma like papillary adenocarcinoma (IA) on adjacent H&E images. Spatial data matrix was obtained based on pathological annotation accordingly. Spatially resolved gene expression of each subtypes was obtain based on pathological annotation to conduct high resolution analyses. TME functional units were calculated by analysis of cellular neighborhoods (CNs) based on cell compositions within resolution of bin 100 (window of 50um x 50um). Sub-populations of tumoral cells were stratified by molecular functions (GSEA and GSVA score) and stemness (CytoTRACE).
 Results:
 All pathological subtypes shared the identical 10 heterogeneous CNs and 5 tumoral clusters (TM) with various propotions. Tumor cluster 0 (TM0) and TM3 were identified as the malignant population with significant high stemness and significant high activities of MTORC1 signaling, TGF-BETA signaling, PI3K-ATK signaling and hypoxia. AC and IA were mainly composed of TM0 and TM3. Compared to TM0, TM3 had higher EMT activity. We further identified two immune-related CNs (CN4 and CN8) with significant high GSVA score of Interferon-Alpha response, Interferon-Gamma response and Inflammatory response. Spatial association showed that the lymphoid-cells-dominated CN4 was enriched in LP and IA and nearly absent in AC. Meanwhile, the myeloid-cells-dominated CN8 was enriched in AC. GSEA score showed that immune activity of CN4 was more intense in IA when compared to LP. Notably, TM0 mainly present in CN8, and TM3 mainly present in CN4. Therefore, the LP was speculated to reach an inert and statical status. TME of AC was featured as colocalization of myeloid cells and tumor cells with high stemness. TME of IA was featured as colocalization of lymphoid cells and tumor cells with high EMT activity.
 Conclusions:
 This is the first study to delineate the homogeneity of tumor cells and heterogeneity of immune cells among different pathological types of NSCLC.

        <tr id="Next generation cancer models, including organoids, neurospheres and cell lines, are significantly advancing our ability to study individual human tumors in vitro and to develop novel cancer therapeutics in settings that resemble in vivo conditions. However, recent questions have emerged as to the degree to which in vitro models may faithfully represent intra- and inter-patient cell state heterogeneity at the transcriptional level of single cells. The Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI), a global collaboration involving the NCI (NIH), Cancer Research UK, the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the Hubrecht Organoid Technology foundation, has generated a large repertoire of 665 patient-derived models of human cancers, including organoids, neurospheres and conditionally reprogrammed cells, with matching parental tumor and clinical annotations. We conducted a tumor-model fidelity analysis using bulk profiles from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and RNA-seq and confirmed strong cell-state concordance between each model and its parental tumor across most HCMI tumor-model pairs, thus showcasing models’ ability to retain key genetic, transcriptional and epigenetic attributes of their parental tumors. However, our analysis also identified divergent features in a subset (<8%) of models, potentially resulting in a loss of fidelity and challenging their translational use. To identify whether this discordance might be driven by ex vivo adaptations or selective evolutionary pressures from in vitro culture, we profiled a representative subset (n=13 pairs) of glioblastoma (GBM, n=7) and pancreatic cancer (PAAD, n=6) tumor-model pairs using single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq). Analysis of 132,593 nuclei (tumors: 66,054; models: 66,539) identified outlier GBM models undergoing proneural-to-mesenchymal (PTM) transition and highlighted serum culture media as a major associated factor of this process. Additionally, we found that divergences in selected PAAD (72,688 nuclei: tumors: 30,254; models: 42,434) pairs were linked to the complete loss of the rich tumor microenvironment cells in the original tumors and the in vitro expansion of select malignant subpopulations, as identified by network-based analysis of VIPER-inferred protein activity profiles. The observed divergences suggest that in vitro culture conditions can occasionally drive cellular reprogramming and alter phenotypic fidelity, resulting in varying degrees of state-specific transitions. However, the majority of the models (even those classified as outliers) are preserved for state-frequency in cellular subpopulations between tumors and models, and most if not all of the cellular states found in the parental tumor, thus faithfully representing intra-tumor heterogeneity. Taken together, these findings highlight the translational potential of the HCMI model repository and its translational relevance as an invaluable tool to support precision oncology.

        <tr id="Background Prostate cancer (PCa) presents substantial heterogeneity and unpredictability in its progression. Despite therapeutic advancements, mortality from advanced PCa remains a significant challenge. Understanding the intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for uncovering mechanisms driving tumorigenesis and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Methods We employed an integrative approach combining bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics to investigate interactions between FAP+ fibroblasts and tumor-associated macrophages in PCa. Key findings were validated using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining techniques. Results Analysis of 23,519 scRNA-seq data from 23 prostate samples revealed a pronounced accumulation of FAP+ fibroblasts in tumor tissues. Spatial transcriptomics and bulk RNA sequencing demonstrated strong associations between FAP+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages. Notably, tumor-specific intercellular signaling pathways, such as CSF1/CSF1R and CXCL/ACKR1, were identified, highlighting their potential role in fostering an immunosuppressive TME. Conclusion Our findings unveil a distinct pattern of crosstalk between FAP+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages in PCa, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets for advanced PCa.">

 Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive disease with poor overall survival rates that have not substantially changed in decades. A key feature underlying the lack of therapeutic success in GBM is its inherent morphological and phenotypic diversity. To better understand intra-tumor heterogeneity, single cell sequencing studies have delineated core transcriptional states to characterize GBM cell phenotypes. This study investigates the role of hypoxia in driving the establishment and transformation of GBM cell state. To characterize the spatial organization of cell states relative to hypoxia, spatial transcriptomics (ST) was performed on samples from GBM patients administered pimonidazole prior to surgery as part of a clinical trial. By overlaying serial pimonidazole-stained sections with ST, we constructed a hypoxia gene signature to identify hypoxic regions in ST. Our ST data was integrated with public datasets to create the largest global GBM dataset. In this dataset, we identified novel, ST-specific states that represent recurring cellular phenotypes. We used geographically weighted models to assess hypoxia’s spatial colocalization with previously defined cell states and our independently derived states. Finally, we investigated underlying mechanisms by which hypoxia may influence cell state using patient derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) cultured under hypoxic conditions. Using ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and bulk RNA-seq, we identified specific genes and chromatin regions differentially regulated under hypoxia. We find that hypoxia demonstrates remarkable spatial correlation with mesenchymal-like cell states, while states reminiscent of neural and glial lineages are notably absent in hypoxic regions. We also identify a leukocyte migratory phenotype strongly spatially correlated with hypoxia, which may indicate immune infiltration in these regions. Epigenetic profiling in GSCs identified specific genomic regions epigenetically regulated by hypoxia. Chromatin regions open under hypoxia with corresponding increased expression are enriched for known hypoxia-associated transcription factors. Conversely, chromatin regions closed and with corresponding decreased expression are enriched for neurodevelopment and differentiation transcription factors. These epigenetically regulated genes are strongly spatially correlated with hypoxic regions in patient ST data and are prognostic as a signature in data from TCGA. Together, our work demonstrates that hypoxia drives remodeling of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape in GBM. In patients, hypoxia and genes epigenetically regulated under hypoxic conditions associate with specific GBM cell states, suggesting that hypoxia-driven epigenetic remodeling may contribute to these state phenotypes and, consequently, to malignant phenotypes in tumors.

 Tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity plays a crucial role in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Advanced multi-omics spatial and single-cell technologies offer unprecedented resolution for dissecting TME complexity. However, the application of these technologies to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples remains underexplored. This study aims to demonstrate the capabilities of these technologies in analyzing FFPE samples, as well as to benchmark and cross-validate different platforms and assays, and deepen our understanding of TME heterogeneity at the single-cell level and its spatial context.



 We performed following assays including 1) High-plex multiple IHC platform: PhenoCycler Fusion (PCF) protein-level spatial analysis (n=10), 2) FFPE Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (FFPE scRNA-seq) (n=4) and 3) Bulk RNAseq RNA-level analysis with FFPE NSCLC samples.



 Firstly, to evaluate the PCF marker expression pattern, cell density of PanCK+PD-L1+ cell ratio (%) was compared to PD-L1 IHC TC score, which showed a high correlation. Further, By image co-registration between H&E with ML-based tumor/stromal classification and PCF PanCK-PD-L1 staining, PD-L1+ cell density in tumor cells specifically can be precisely calculated. To further evaluate the marker gene expression consistency, high gene expression concordance was observed across PhenoCycler Fusion (PCF), formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) data. This high concordance (average pearson r=0.84) validates the consistency and reliability of our multi-omics approach, ensuring that the data obtained from different sample types are comparable and robust. A diverse TME was identified, highlighting the complexity and heterogeneity of TME components. This diversity was evident in the range of immune cell subsets and cancer-associated stromal cells detected, underscoring the importance of comprehensive TME analysis even in small cohorts. In addition, FFPE scRNAseq enabled a deeper profiling at transcriptome level with a median gene recovery rate at 1130 genes per cell, which contribute to a more detailed cell lineage identification including small populations like Mast cells and neutrophils.



 Overall, the study demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of PCF in evaluating PD-L1 expression and the TME. The high concordance across multi-omics approaches and the detailed transcriptome profiling provided by FFPE scRNAseq highlight the robustness of these latest methodology on FFPE samples. Despite the limited sample size, the diverse TME identified emphasizes the need for comprehensive and personalized TME analysis. These findings provide a foundation for further investigations into the TME.

        <tr id="The tumour microenvironment is composed of a complex cellular network involving cancer, stromal and immune cells in dynamic interactions. A large proportion of this network relies on direct physical interactions between cells, which may impact patient responses to clinical therapy. Doublets in scRNA-seq are usually excluded from analysis. However, they may represent directly interacting cells. To decipher the physical interaction landscape in relation to clinical prognosis, we inferred a physical cell–cell interaction (PCI) network from ‘biological’ doublets in a scRNA-seq dataset of approximately 18,000 cells, obtained from 7 treatment-naive ovarian cancer patients. Focusing on cancer-stromal PCIs, we uncovered molecular interaction networks and transcriptional landscapes that stratified patients in respect to their clinical responses to standard therapy. Good responders featured PCIs involving immune cells interacting with other cell types including cancer cells. Poor responders lacked immune cell interactions, but showed a high enrichment of cancer-stromal PCIs. To explore the molecular differences between cancer-stromal PCIs between responders and non-responders, we identified correlating gene signatures. We constructed ligand-receptor interaction networks and identified associated downstream pathways. The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks and trajectory analysis revealed distinct transcription factor (TF) clusters and gene modules that separated doublet cells by clinical outcomes. Our results indicate (i) that transcriptional changes resulting from PCIs predict the response of ovarian cancer patients to standard therapy, (ii) that immune reactivity of the host against the tumour enhances the efficacy of therapy, and (iii) that cancer-stromal cell interaction can have a dual effect either supporting or inhibiting therapy responses.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer, a significant cause of cancer-related mortality, often exhibits drug resistance, highlighting the need for improved tumor models to advance personalized drug testing and precision therapy. We generated organoids from primary colorectal cancer cells cultured through the conditional reprogramming technique, establishing a framework to perform short-term drug testing studies on patient-derived cells. To model interactions with stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, we combined cancer cell organoids with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a cell type implicated in disease progression and drug resistance. Our organotypic models revealed that CAFs promote cancer cell proliferation and stemness primarily through HGF-MET paracrine signaling and activation of Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs). Disrupting these tumor-stromal interactions reduced organoid size while limiting oncogenic signals and cancer stemness. Leveraging this tumor model, we identified effective drug combinations targeting colorectal cancer cells and their tumorigenic activities. Our study highlights a path to incorporate patient-derived cells and tumor-stromal interactions into a drug testing workflow that could identify effective therapies for individual patients.">

 Human diseases affect various cell types within the local niche, but the multicellular responses of human diseases have not been collectively assessed across organs. Here, we categorize multicellular responses of human diseases based on a remapped human cell atlas, incorporating 12 million single-cell transcriptome profiles acquired from an automated data collection pipeline. Additional curation expands the collection up to 46 million cells, covering 160 disease conditions across 49 distinct organ identities. From the re-aligned atlas of single-cell transcriptome data, we constructed a hierarchical cell classification framework comprising 32 major cell types and 165 cell subtype annotations. Systematic profiling of disease and organ association patterns of cellular subtype reveals archetypes of human diseases repeatedly found across organs, including a multicellular phenotype highly specific to the tumor microenvironment. The universal cell atlas could serve as a reference for unbiased deconvolution of spatial transcriptome datasets, revealing spatial distribution patterns associated with immunotherapy responses. Collectively, our study provides foundational resources for cross-tissue cell type annotation, presents a comprehensive multicellular overview of disease-associated responses across human tissues, and highlights multicellular responses in tumor microenvironments.

 Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but remains largely ineffective in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). A hallmark of PDAC is local immunosuppression, driving cytotoxic T cell exclusion and deactivation, undermining immune-mediated tumor control. Better understanding of the cellular crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and identifying stromal and immune populations shaping this immunosuppressive landscape is critically needed. Oncogenic KRAS activation in PDAC cells promotes recruitment and proliferation of tumor-supporting stromal cells while excluding cancer-targeted cytotoxic T cells. Local immunosuppression is driven by interactions between subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and resident myeloid cells. Previous efforts to reverse immunosuppression by targeting individual stromal populations have largely failed, highlighting the complexity of stromal interactions in the TME. The stromal diversity of PDAC complicates investigating paracrine signaling involving multiple cell types. To address this, we use in vivo mouse models that recapitulate human disease, alongside a novel tumor explant system enabling short-term culture of intact human or murine PDAC tissue. These explants retain histopathological architecture and cellular diversity, providing a medium-throughput platform for testing drugs and mechanistic hypotheses in the native TME. Preliminary data show that Smoothened inhibition (SMOi) reduces myCAF proliferation and activity but drives CD11b-positive myeloid cell expansion in vivo. We hypothesize local immunosuppression in PDAC is sustained by a delicate balance between myCAFs and myeloid cells, collectively hindering T cell infiltration. Single-cell RNA sequencing of control vs. SMOi-treated murine PDAC identified stromal subpopulations maintaining immunosuppression and revealed specific myeloid subtypes emerging after SMOi. Strikingly, combining SMOi with anti-Gr1 or CCR1 inhibition (CCR1i) markedly increased cytotoxic T cell numbers—up to 20-fold—within the TME. We are now exploring whether these T cells’ activity can be further enhanced using additional immunomodulatory agents. Testing therapeutic combinations in the same TME allows us to identify synergistic effects that may inform future PDAC immunotherapy. Our work elucidates complex immunosuppressive mechanisms in PDAC, leveraging a novel tumor explant system and in vivo models. Our ultimate goal is to develop translatable regimens that neutralize local immunosuppression, enabling cytotoxic T cells to infiltrate, proliferate, and effectively attack cancer cells.

 Background:
 Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a smooth muscle-derived tumor with significant heterogeneity and limited treatment options for recurrent/metastatic disease. A lack of targetable driver mutations and prognostic and predictive biomarkers have hampered the care of patients with LMS. There is a great need to better understand the biology of LMS and develop novel therapeutics. Advances in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have allowed for better understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity in diverse cancer subtypes. However, tissue dissociation during this process leads to loss of spatial context. Spatial gene expression analysis builds upon scRNA-seq and has the potential to yield information about tissue organization, cell-cell interactions, niches, and cell states. To date there have been limited application of spatial transcriptomics to sarcoma.
 Methods:
 We performed single nucleus multiome (snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq) on a cohort of 16 primary, untreated LMS samples including 12 soft tissue (STLMS) and 4 uterine (ULMS) tumors. We then designed a custom 480-gene panel using the differentially expressed genes from clusters identified in snRNA-seq data to be able to identify spatial relationships between these clusters and to assess these clusters on a larger scale. We utilized the 10x Genomics Xenium platform. This was applied to LMS tissue microarrays (TMAs) comprising a total of 326 tissue cores from 127 unique patients. Matched primary and metastatic samples from the same patient were available for 33 patients.
 Results:
 Analysis of scRNAseq data identified 2 distinct subtypes: a dedifferentiated subtype with mesenchymal features (MES) and a differentiated subtype with enrichment of smooth muscle cell markers (SMC). Integration of chromatin accessibility data from snATACseq showed enrichment of nuclear factor I (NFI) transcription factor (TF) motifs in the MES and AP-1 motifs in the SMC group. Whole genome sequencing did not reveal an obvious genomic etiology for these subtypes. Spatial transcriptomics was able to identify these 2 subtypes in a larger cohort of tumors. Consistent with snRNAseq data, we find that most tumors had almost exclusively either MES or SMC cells. We assessed spatial relationships between these subtypes and infiltrating immune cells. This revealed an enrichment in immunosuppressive macrophages and exhausted T cells in MES tumors compared to SMC tumors. Analysis of matched primary and metastatic tumors demonstrated that the subtype (MES or SMC) generally remains consistent between different sites of disease.
 Conclusions:
 We identify 2 novel LMS subtypes (MES and SMC) driven by distinct TFs. Spatial transcriptomic analysis confirmed the presence of these 2 subtypes in a larger cohort and demonstrated that MES tumors are associated with a more immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

 Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are highly heterogeneous and aggressive cancers with diverse histological subtypes, molecular profiles, tumor microenvironments (TMEs), and clinical behaviors. Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), a hallmark of RCC, arises from distinct subclones within the same tumor that vary histopathologically and molecularly. To elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying RCC tumorigenesis at single-cell resolution, we examined 155 tumor specimens from 78 cases, encompassing clear cell RCC (ccRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC), chromophobe RCC (chRCC), and rare subtypes. We utilized 80 single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and 55 single-nucleus ATAC sequencing (snATAC-seq) datasets alongside advanced spatial biology techniques, including 27 Xenium In Situ, 12 Visium spatial transcriptomics (ST), and 7 co-detection by indexing (CODEX) samples. The connection of matched bulk proteogenomic data, clinical annotations, and histopathological evaluations from H&E staining further enhanced our spatial multimodal investigation. From single-nucleus sequencing of over half a million nuclei, we identified specific transcriptional programs and chromatin accessibility patterns among RCC subtypes, including HIF pathway dysregulation in ccRCC and MET pathway activation in pRCC. We also identified markers and constructed signature scores for rare but high-grade phenotypes, such as the aggressive rhabdoid and sarcomatoid features in ccRCC. Spatial analyses confirmed the utility of these feature-associated signatures for detection, quantification, and potential therapeutic targeting. Furthermore, we characterized the spatial organization and tumor-TME interactions, providing critical insights into spatially diverse ITH in RCC. Notably, a Grade-4 ccRCC sample exhibited three distinct tumor subclones and regions of necrosis characterized by Xenium, CODEX, and Visium profiling. Among these, a rhabdoid-associated subclone showed tumor-intrinsic signatures of elevated cell cycle activity and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), distinguishing it from conventional ccRCC subclones and indicating higher metastatic potential. We further revealed a unique macrophage subpopulation closely interacting with the rhabdoid subclone, forming an immunosuppressive niche that likely contributes to immune evasion, resistance to immunotherapies, and disease recurrence. Collectively, our spatial multimodal findings delineate the molecular signatures and mechanisms underlying RCC heterogeneity and aggressive features. By linking spatially distinct subclones to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance, this study provides valuable insights for developing personalized and effective therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for RCC patients.

        <tr id="Objectives The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). This study aims to investigate the cellular composition of the TME in LUAD and assess the role of the MDK-NCL signaling pathway. Methods We employed a multi-omics strategy to investigate LUAD, combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics (ST), and bulk RNA-seq datasets. Publicly available scRNA-seq data and ST data were utilized. scRNA-seq data underwent quality control, dimensionality reduction, and clustering to characterize cell populations and identify malignant epithelial subtypes using the Seurat and inferCNV packages. Spatial transcriptomics data facilitated the identification of distinct tumor niches, while immune infiltration and ligand-receptor interactions were analyzed using MCPcounter and Niches. Experimental validation was performed via real-time PCR and western blotting on paired LUAD and adjacent normal tissue samples. Results scRNA-seq revealed the presence of multiple immune and stromal cell populations, with malignant epithelial cells being subdivided into six clusters. The MDK-NCL axis demonstrated high activity in malignant cells, showing strong interactions with immune and stromal components. Spatial transcriptomics revealed nine distinct tumor niches, with MDK-NCL signaling notably upregulated at the tumor-immune interface, highlighting its role in establishing an immunosuppressive microenvironment. In both the TCGA-LUAD cohort and in-house cohort, MDK and NCL were significantly upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels in tumor samples compared to normal tissues. High MDK-NCL expression in the TCGA-LUAD cohort correlated with increased TMB, MSI, and reduced immune cell infiltration. Elevated levels of immune checkpoint genes, including PD-1 and CTLA-4, in patients with high MDK-NCL expression suggested a potential resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Moreover, patients with high MDK-NCL expression exhibited poorer survival outcomes, underscoring the pathway’s role in tumor progression and immune evasion. Conclusion Our findings reveal that LUAD cells use the MDK-NCL signaling pathway to shape the TME, suppressing immune activity and promoting malignancy in epithelial cells. This study highlights the MDK-NCL axis as a potential therapeutic target for LUAD, particularly for patients with high MDK-NCL expression.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest cancers, with a five-year survival rate of 13%. The tumor microenvironment (TME) in PDAC includes a heterogeneous population of cells. In genetically engineered mouse models, the TME evolves alongside the formation and progression of epithelial precursor lesions to cancer. However, the evolution of the TME in human samples has not been thoroughly characterized, primarily due to limited access to pre-malignant pancreatic tissue. Leveraging a collaboration with Gift of Life Michigan, an organ donor organization, we previously reported that precursor lesions are abundant in the normal human pancreas (Carpenter et al., Cancer Discovery, 2023). To date, we have collected over 100 human pancreata, a dataset that enables us to map the characteristics of these lesions and their surrounding microenvironment across variables such as age, sex, and race. Here, we aim to model the co-evolution of the stroma and neoplastic epithelium during tumor progression. We utilized spatial transcriptomics technology with the 10x Visium platform, analyzing over 20 human pancreata during the discovery phase. We applied a spatially aware clustering approach to delineate distinct tissue domains across normal, tumor-adjacent, and tumor samples. We leveraged a previously established single-cell RNA-seq atlas (n=41) to deconvolute cell-type fractions and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles within each spatial transcriptomics spot. As a result, we identified distinct epithelial structures (e.g., Acinar, Ducts, PanINs, tumor) as well as stromal domains (e.g., tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), fibrotic regions). We hypothesized that stromal gene expression is influenced by the proximity to and the density of different epithelial structures. Therefore, we employed a kernel density estimation approach to model gene expression in stromal cells, specifically fibroblasts and macrophages, as a function of epithelial-specific density. This analysis uncovered distinct characteristics of the stroma surrounding precursor lesions compared to tumor stroma, emphasizing spatially regulated gene expression programs that likely drive TME remodeling in PDAC. Future directions include performing cell-cell interaction analysis to further elucidate epithelial-stromal crosstalk, complemented by in vitro functional experiments to validate the pro- or anti-tumorigenic roles of the identified markers. This work lays the foundation for spatially resolved insights into PDAC biology, informing therapeutic strategies targeting the TME.

 Cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of death and financial burden on public health worldwide. Despite advances in detection and treatments, there is still a significant level of uncertainty in predicting how an individual's cancer will respond to treatment due to tumor heterogeneity among different patients and multiple subclones from the same individual. A more comprehensive understanding of cancer cell populations, their molecular interactions, and their microenvironment can offer valuable insights into optimal treatment strategies and patient stratification. This can be achieved through the integrated detection of both RNA and protein targets, enabling a deeper exploration of the molecular mechanisms driving cancer.
 Here, we analyzed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human tissue sections from diverse tissue types using spatial multi-omics technologies from 10x Genomics. A new add-on capability enables visualization and analysis of protein expression for key immuno-oncology markers including markers for immune cell typing, cell structure, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as immune checkpoint markers (e.g., PD-1, PD-L1, LAG-3, and VISTA). Simultaneous spatial profiling of 480 genes and 28 proteins, integrated with H&E imaging, provided detailed insights into tissue architecture, tumor origins, immune cell infiltration, and the immune status of the tumor microenvironment.
 The combined RNA and protein profiling method is a powerful approach for validating RNA-based findings and providing definitive evidence at the functional biological level. Protein data also offers critical insights into the expression and function of different isoforms that are challenging to discern at the RNA level. For instance, isoforms such as CD45RA and CD45RO, which arise from alternative splicing of the PTPRC gene, are often indistinguishable using RNA profiling alone due to the shared exonic sequences in their transcripts. However, protein-level analysis can differentiate these isoforms and enables a more precise understanding of their distinct roles in the immune response, including the delineation of naïve and memory T-cell subsets.
 Furthermore, RNA expression does not always directly correlate with protein levels, underscoring the importance of integrating both data types. For instance, discrepancies between RNA and protein expression were observed for β-catenin, encoded by the CTNNB1 gene, across tissues. β-catenin plays a pivotal role in tumor progression through its dual functions in cell adhesion and signaling. By integrating RNA and protein data, researchers can uncover the complexities of post-transcriptional regulation, subcellular localization, and their combined influence on cancer progression, providing deeper insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

In this study, we have identified transcriptionally distinct types of mutation-harboring precancerous cells in our spontaneous, somatic mouse model recapitulating human GBM evolution as well as in tumor-free SVZ tissues from patients. These precancerous cells emerge via oligodendrocyte lineage specification, exhibiting unique transcriptional programs involving dysregulated translations and extracellular matrix remodeling. Subsequently, they give rise to heterogeneous tumor cell populations by activating multiple programs crucial for gliomagenesis.

        <tr id="Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a complex biological pathway that facilitates cellular plasticity, is used by tumor cells to enable metastasis and drug resistance. Our functional understanding of the impact of EMT on cancer has been limited by the lack of effective tools to ablate tumor cells as they become mesenchymal. In a recent study published in Nature, Perelli and colleagues used elegant genetically engineered lineage tracing and ablation strategies to track and eliminate tumor cells as they undergo EMT in pancreatic cancer. In a two-pronged approach, they queried the functional consequences of ablating EMT tumor cells before pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) formation or in advanced PDAC tumors. These experiments collectively revealed that epithelial tumor cells only progress to low-grade lesions with minimal proliferative potential, while mesenchymal tumor cells undergo EMT early on to become malignant and metastasize. Profiling of mesenchymal tumor cell lineages revealed an altered chromatin landscape that leads to chromosomal instability (CIN) and disease progression. CIN is facilitated through complex structural rearrangements and chromothripsis, ultimately driving increased tumor heterogeneity and enhanced proliferation in EMT cells. This work reveals that EMT is an important driver of tumor heterogeneity and progression as a downstream consequence of CIN and provides mechanistic insight into how cellular plasticity can lead to genomic changes that drive disease progression.">

        <tr id="Background The differentiation characteristics of neutrophils within the gastric cancer (GC) tumor microenvironment (TME) and their interactions with malignant gastric epithelial cells require further investigation. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) in immunotherapy remains inadequately explored. Methods We integrated two single-cell transcriptome datasets comprising 12 samples, including gastric primary tumors, non-tumor tissues, and metastatic tumors, to profile the epithelial cells and TANs atlas within the TME and examine their interaction modules. In addition, these data were integrated with the bulk transcriptomic including the Cancer Genome Atlas - Stomach Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-STAD) and Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG) datasets to analyze the expression levels of neutrophil-associated genes across the tumor-associated neutrophil subsets. Results We analyzed 3,118 gastric epithelial cells and 2,365 TANs from all samples. Epithelial cells were classified into ten subclusters, while TANs were grouped into five subclusters. In gastric primary tumors, epithelial cell subtypes included primarily MUC16 + and stem-like populations. In metastatic tumors, the epithelial cell subset with high CXCL5 expression was a characteristic subtype. TANs mainly interacted with epithelial cells via the LGALS9-CD45 and CD46-JAG1 pathways. And RGS2 was highly expressed in N4, a tumor-associated neutrophils subcluster characterized by high MMP9 expression, highlighting its potential as an immunotherapy target. Conclusion TANs exhibit robust interactions with gastric malignant epithelial cell subsets. Furthermore, RGS2, which is highly expressed in N4, could serve as a promising target for immunotherapy.

 The tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) in solid tumors is a complex ecosystem consisting of diverse interactions between cellular populations. Deeper investigation into the TIME reveals a prominent role of immune cells in regulating tumor progression- a novel phenomenon that has encouraged the evaluation of the crosstalk between cell types. The development of spatial omic technologies has thus enabled the exploration of these nuances at previously inaccessible resolutions, but the currently available platforms come at the cost of introducing bias, excluding molecular information, and incompatibility with single cell technologies. Here, we leverage a photoactivatable (PA) dye Janelia-Fluor-646 in combination with a digital light processing (DLP) microscope to address these issues by developing a platform that enables the spatially guided isolation of cell populations from a region of interest (ROI) for downstream multiomic and single cell analyses. As proof of concept, we show that ROIs identified via immunofluorescence could successfully be barcoded in mouse spleen and tumor sections using the dye and distinguished from the background by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). We also demonstrate the ability to extract high quality DNA, RNA, and protein- as well as maintain high cell viability post-sorting. We have also developed a pipeline for the analysis of the sequenced RNA to identify differential patterns of gene expression present in immune cells from spatially distinct regions. Moving forward, we hope to establish this as a platform for immune landscape analysis within the TIME to uncover unique targets that could be explored within the context of tumor-immune interactions as well as immunotherapeutic development. Our findings will also help us generate the first single-cell atlas of niche-specific immune cells.

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in tumor progression, immune evasion, and therapeutic responses. Among its key components, endothelial cells (ECs) are crucial regulators of angiogenesis, immune cell trafficking, and metabolic adaptations. This study integrates single-cell and transcriptomic analyses to identify tumor-specific endothelial cell signatures in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and stratify tumors into three distinct molecular subtypes. These subtypes exhibit unique immune landscapes and biological characteristics, including pathway activation and differential responses to immunotherapy and targeted treatments. Using machine learning, we developed a robust prognostic scoring model to predict patient outcomes and therapy responsiveness, which was validated across independent cohorts. Our findings highlight the critical role of endothelial cells in modulating the TME and underscore the potential of targeting EC-specific molecular features to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy and optimize personalized cancer treatment.

 The ability to stain and image tissue at high-plex over an entire slide in a single round enables insights into tissue architecture and the molecular mechanisms of immune and disease processes at unprecedented throughput. Here we investigate a whole slide tissue section of high-grade colon adenocarcinoma, a hot tumor that contains prominent clusters of PD-L1 expression scattered throughout, using single-step high-plex staining and imaging at single-cell resolution followed by the analysis of single-cell phenotypes, tissue segmentation and spatial proximity and nearest neighbor analysis.



 A standard pathology slide was stained in one round with a 13-plex immune-oncology panel then a 21.7 x 18.5 mm area imaged in one round with the Orion™ spatial biology platform (RareCyte). The panel consisted of Hoechst/nucleus, autofluorescence, Ki-67, CD3e, CD4, CD163, CD8a, PD-L1, PD-1, FOXP3, CD68, CD20, Pan-CK, and Vimentin. Analysis was performed on the resulting OME.TIFF file with Phenoplex™ (Visiopharm) using the following pipeline: tissue segmentation into epithelial, necrotic and stromal regions of interest; cell segmentation using the Visiopharm Blueprint APP for DAPI nuclear detection; and phenotyping and spatial biodistribution analysis using the Guided Highplex Workflow.



 Data revealed intricate architecture and cellular transitions as tumor cells express varying levels of PAN-CK, with a subset proliferating, and PD-L1 clusters within the lamina propria. Leukocyte clusters are seen interacting with PD-L1+ macrophages and, at higher zoom level, the proximity can be measured of infiltrating T and B cells near the tumor cells. A variety of spatial distance-metric analyses were performed. As an example, neighbor analysis within the stromal ROI showed that PD-L1+ macrophages had a different neighborhood of immune cells within their vicinity compared to PD-L1- macrophages.



 These data highlight the importance of sufficient plex, resolution and whole slide context to derive reliable spatial biomarkers of potential prognostic value. The ability to generate such rich data in just hours across a whole section with multiplexed biomarker quantitation makes this approach suited to multi-patient clinical studies. Deep-learning based image analysis enables deeper insights into the TME of cancer samples and enables researchers to robustly and accurately quantify and classify tissue samples to understand biology of disease.

 Advanced melanoma is an aggressive cancer with a high metastatic potential often resulting in melanoma brain metastases (MBM). The complexity of the MBM tumor microenvironment (TME) impacts tumor progression and therapy response, leading to poor outcomes. Our study integrates spatial transcriptomics profiles with tissue morphology annotations of MBM and clinical data to investigate the TME landscape in relation to treatment and patient outcomes.



 We performed spatial transcriptomics on 21 MBM samples collected after various treatment strategies. All samples were preserved in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks and profiled using the Visium Spatial Gene Expression kit (10X Genomics) with a 6.5x6.5mm Visium Capture slide. All sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq6000 platform (Illumina) with an average of 71,391 reads per spots. H&E slides were annotated by our study pathologist (DL) to enable pathology-guided cluster analysis. Spatial transcriptomics data analysis was conducted using Seurat R pipeline which involved data quality check, normalization, integration, cell type annotation and deconvolution, and clustering. Further differential gene expression analyses were performed between different identified tumor clusters or between clinical groups, leading to the identification of enriched pathways and cell-cell interaction patterns.



 Our phenotyping of 25,208 spots revealed the presence of diverse cell populations, including neurons, melanoma, plasma, endothelial, stromal, and myeloid cells. We identified 8 distinct functional clusters characterized by specific gene expression and activated pathways. These include 5 tumor clusters with different immune infiltration or expression profiles, identifying differences in cell metabolism and heterogeneity in the TME. Importantly, we found MBM from patients exposed to radiation were significantly enriched for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathway and genes related to cell adhesion. We further showed a reduced immune response in patients received radiation compared those who did not, and we noted that an active immune response was generally positively correlated with survival.



 Our study is the largest spatial analysis of MBM reported to date. Advances in spatial technologies provide novel insights into the structure and composition of MBM TME. Our findings highlight the importance of spatial context in understanding MBM biology and the potential of spatial transcriptomics in advancing precision oncology.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal adult brain tumor. The cellular heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in the complexity of treatment and poor survival. GBM is typically classified into 3 molecular subtypes-Classical, Mesenchymal, and Proneural-associated with EGFR, NF1, and PDGFRA genetic drivers, respectively. Yet, the role of these driver mutations on the GBM TME is not fully understood. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA-sequencing of genetically engineered mouse GBM models incorporating human-relevant EGFRvIII, PDGFB, and NF1 driver mutations to systematically characterize the genotype-immunophenotype relationship of the three GBM subtypes. Murine genetic GBM models at the single-cell level effectively mimic the inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity found in human counterparts. Our analysis revealed that PDGFB-driven tumors were more proliferative and enriched for Wnt signaling interactions, while EGFRvIII-driven tumors showed an elevated interferon signaling response. Moreover, Nf1-silenced tumors displayed higher myeloid abundance, myeloid immunosuppressive interactions involving Osteopontin, Treg infiltration, and expression of immune checkpoint molecule Ctla4. Overall, we established a human-mouse analytical platform for genotype-aware target discovery and validation, which offers promising new avenues for more effective, personalized treatments in GBM.">

        <tr id="Abstract Motivation The analysis of cell migration using time-lapse microscopy typically focuses on track characteristics for classification and statistical evaluation of migration behaviour. However, considerable heterogeneity can be seen in cell morphology and microscope signal intensity features within the migrating cell populations. Results To utilize this information in cell migration analysis, we introduce here an R package CellRomeR, designed for the phenotypic clustering of cells based on their morphological and motility features from microscopy images. Utilizing machine learning techniques and building on an iterative clustering projection method, CellRomeR offers a new approach to identify heterogeneity in cell populations. The clustering of cells along the migration tracks allows association of distinct cellular phenotypes with different cell migration types and detection of migration patterns associated with stable and unstable cell phenotypes. The user-friendly interface of CellRomeR and multiple visualization options facilitate an in-depth understanding of cellular behaviour, addressing previous challenges in clustering cell trajectories using microscope cell tracking data. Availability and implementation CellRomeR is available as an R package from https://github.com/elolab/CellRomeR.">

        <tr id="CAR-T cell therapies are revolutionizing the treatment of refractory and relapsed haematological malignancies, but many patients do not exhibit long-term responses, and these therapies are less effective against solid tumors. Poor persistence of CAR-T cells in patients is associated with therapeutic failure, highlighting the need to identify strategies promoting in vivo expansion. Here, we developed an in vivo competitive screening method to identify genes whose inactivation confers a selective advantage to CAR-T cells. Inactivation of 50 genes in a heterogeneous population of T cells expressing an EGFR-targeting CAR revealed that disruption of REGNASE-1, SOCS1, PTPN2, and P16/NK4A conferred a selective advantage to CAR-T cells in human lung tumor-bearing mice. Consistently, inactivation of these genes improved tumor eradication by CAR-T cells. Interestingly disruption of other genes, described to improve CAR-T cell function in other contexts, had a negative impact in this orthotopic lung tumor model. Further evaluation of long-term effects in a subcutaneous model, highlighted SOCS1 ablation as the most promising strategy for in vivo CAR-T cell amelioration. These results support the importance of evaluating CAR-T cell editing strategies in tumor-specific models and highlight the versatility of our screening approach as a pre-clinical tool for context-specific studies on CAR-T cells amelioration.">

        <tr id="Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by alternating periods of activity and remission. This study investigates whether the cellular environments of quiescent (inactive disease) and normal tissues show similarities or differences, exploring potential residual effects from disease and tissue recovery patterns. While active CD can typically be characterized by high neutrophil density, whereas quiescent tissues present less pronounced inflammatory markers. This study leverages multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) data to examine the distributions and patterns of various nuclei subtypes in quiescent versus normal tissues, aiming to determine how similar or different these tissues are in the absence of active inflammation. In our study, we analyze four tissue samples labeled as normal and five as quiescent from CD patients, as determined by a pathologist. We use rigid and deformable registration of MxIF images to analyze these tissues in a unified space and classify the nuclei into 13 subtypes. Using a KD tree, we identify the 10 nearest neighbors for each nucleus, building a combined distance-weighted neighborhood matrix representing both normal and quiescent tissues. We projected these neighborhoods into 2 dimensions using t-distributed stochastic nearest neighbor(t-SNE), clustered them, and calculated the enrichment for each subtype between normal and quiescent states within each of 20 and 40 clusters. In the 20-cluster analysis, we find monocytes enrich in one cluster and leukocytes enrich in two clusters for normal and quiescent tissues respectively. For the 40-cluster analysis, we observe monocytes, macrophages, and leukocytes enrich in one cluster each in normal tissues, and in the quiescent condition, one cluster enriched with enteroendocrine cells, and two clusters enriched with leukocytes. The results were statistically significant as determined by a chi-squared test (p < 0.01). These differences suggest a possible association with the tissue state and its microenvironment dynamics between normal and quiescent CD.">

 Oligonucleotide therapeutics, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are promising tools for targeting oncogenic pathways in cancer. However, their impact on tumor microenvironment (TME) architecture and cellular phenotypes within cancer tissues remains insufficiently understood. This study integrates oligonucleotide-based treatments with advanced spatial phenotyping to explore their effects on cancer tissues at a high-definition, single-cell scale.



 Cancer tissues treated with oligonucleotide therapeutics were analyzed using multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and spatial transcriptomics. Cellular phenotypes, including immune and stromal cell populations, were characterized in situ to assess changes in the TME. High-resolution imaging and transcriptomic profiling were used to localize therapeutic effects, while computational analysis integrated phenotypic and molecular data to uncover spatially resolved mechanisms.



 Oligonucleotide treatment led to distinct spatial alterations in the TME, including reprogramming of tumor associated macrophages and increased infiltration of cytotoxic T cells in peritumoral regions. Spatial transcriptomics revealed suppression of target oncogenes, alongside upregulation of immune activation pathways in responsive regions of the tissue. Notably, these effects were localized to specific niches, suggesting cell-type-specific and spatially restricted therapeutic responses.



 This study highlights the power of integrating oligonucleotide therapeutics with spatial phenotyping to uncover their impact on the TME in cancer tissues. The findings provide valuable insights into the spatial dynamics of oligonucleotide therapy, paving the way for more effective design and deployment of these treatments in oncology.

        <tr id="Adenomyosis, characterized by clinical intractability, significantly impacts female fertility and life quality due to the absence of definitive diagnostic markers and effective treatment options. The invagination theory is a primary hypothesis for adenomyosis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, a spatial transcriptional landscape of adenomyosis with an evident invagination structure is mapped from the endometrial invaginating site to ectopic lesions utilizing spatial transcriptomics and single‐cell RNA sequencing. In addition, the authors employ bulk RNA sequencing deconvolution to assess the significance of core spatial ecotypes, use histological techniques to target specific cell types, and conduct in vitro experiments for validation. At the invagination site, SFRP5+ epithelial cells promote endometrial proliferation and angiogenesis through secretion of IHH. During the invading process, ESR1+ smooth muscle cells (SMCs) facilitate invasion by creating migratory tracts via collagen degradation. Within deep lesions, CNN1+ stromal fibroblasts induce fibrosis by undergoing a fibroblast‐to‐myofibroblast transition (FMT) in response to pathologic profibrogenic signals in the microenvironment of lesions. This work offers an in‐depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathological processes of adenomyosis with invagination. Furthermore, this work introduces the first transcriptomics web source of adenomyosis, which is expected to be a valuable resource for subsequent research.">

        <tr id="One of the leading causes of tumor cell heterogeneity is the complex nature of the tumor immune microenvironment involving crosstalk between different signaling pathways of cancer cells and immune cells. For cancer cells to grow into a primary tumor and then metastasize into secondary tumors, they must avoid or overcome the attack of different types of immune cells, including macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and T lymphocytes. For example, cancer cells can polarize macrophages from “tumor killing” to “tumor promoting” type using specific signaling molecules. Such tumor immune crosstalk is dependent on the clonal and sub-clonal heterogeneity in genomic, transcriptomic and protein signaling networks across different cancer cell sub-populations, immune cells and its surrounding microenvironment. Since structural aberrations affect gene dysregulation, the study of the 3D- genome organization in single cells can help in better understanding of disease progression and prognosis. The genome is organized and packaged in a highly structured manner inside the nucleus of mammalian cells and exhibits dynamic reorganization throughout disease progression. Understanding this 3D organization at the single-cell level with high spatial resolution is crucial for immune-oncology disease research such as investigating tumor-immune cell interactions.
 In this abstract, we present a novel jebFISHTM protocol on the PaintScapeTM platform that can be used to investigate immune cell modulated differences in global 3D genome organization among different localized and metastatic breast cancer cell lines at single cell, sub-population and population level. Using a genome wide panel of chromosomal targets on an onco-immune co-culture system involving different breast cancer cell lines and CD4+ T-cells or macrophages, we will show disruption in chromosome territory, radius of gyration, chromosomal instability between localized and metastatic breast cancer cells at single cell and sub-population level. We observed signatures of specific 3D genome structural alterations and interchromosomal interactions in cancer cells and/or immune cells, related to the effect of different types of immune response. We will show how the 3D architecture of key genomic loci and its associated regulatory elements belonging to major cancer signaling pathways exhibit specific signatures including differential folding, chromosomal instability, differential interchromosomal interaction and structural variation patterns at single cell, sub-chromosomal and sub-population level. We envision this study will improve our understanding on breast cancer tumor immune microenvironment and provide deeper insight into the underlying genomic heterogeneity of single cancer cells and sub-populations which might help to design better treatment options in the future.

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Immunotherapy has demonstrated promise in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), but certain patients encounter limited benefits, highlighting the need for immunosuppressive biomarkers. Extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA) promotes amplification of MYC-paralogs (MYC, MYCN and MYCL), driving cross-resistance in SCLC. Here, we aim to investigate whether ecDNA-mediated MYC-paralogs amplification (ecMYC+) represents immunosuppressive features in SCLC.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Bulk RNA sequencing data were retrieved from public database and paraffin-embedded samples. The overexpression and amplification of MYC-paralogs were identified using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Imaging mass cytometry and multiplex immunohistochemistry were used to characterize spatial distribution of tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). The copy number of MYC-paralogs was investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry were performed in SCLC cell lines.


RESULTS
The mean copy number of ecDNAs and the frequency of ecMYC+ cell lines were higher in SCLC than that in the other lineages (SCLC 22/47 vs others 15/282). In ecMYC+ SCLC, multiple immune-related pathways were downregulated while nucleotide metabolism processes were upregulated. Inhibition of nucleotide metabolism induced ecDNA elimination, along with activated antigen presenting pathways. Highly dispersed MYC-paralogs amplifications were detected in resected treatment-naïve SCLC samples. Through the resolution of 103,341 cells from 24 pathological regions, we observed higher expression of MKI67, VEGFA, FAP and FOXP3 and reduced T cell infiltration in ecMYC+ samples. Moreover, ecMYC+ samples exhibited elevated cellular neighborhoods dominated by Ki67+ tumors, with reduced spatial interaction with immune cells.


CONCLUSIONS
Extrachromosomal amplification of MYC-paralogs shapes suppressive TIME, identifying potential subgroup of immunotherapy resistant patients.">

        <tr id="Cervical cancer represents a significant global health challenge, with complex cellular and molecular mechanisms driving its progression from HPV infection to invasive malignancy. This study employed an integrated approach combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (stRNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize the tumor microenvironment (TME) across different stages of cervical cancer development. Through analysis of samples from normal cervix, HPV-infected normal cervix, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and invasive cervical cancer, we identified distinct cellular populations and their dynamic changes during disease progression. Our findings revealed significant heterogeneity in immune cell populations, particularly highlighting the role of SPP1+ macrophages that were substantially enriched in cervical cancer compared to precancerous and normal tissues. Cell-cell communication networks and spatial mapping demonstrated that SPP1+ macrophages interact extensively with immune cells through the SPP1-CD44 signaling axis. This interaction contributes to an immunosuppressive microenvironment through modulation of T cell function and promotion of tumor cell survival. Furthermore, high expression of SPP1 correlated with advanced tumor stages and poor overall survival in cervical cancer patients, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Our comprehensive characterization of the cellular landscape and intercellular communication networks in cervical cancer progression provides valuable insights for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the TME, particularly through disruption of the SPP1-CD44 axis. These findings establish a foundation for more effective personalized approaches to improve clinical outcomes in cervical cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal cancer of the central nervous system, presenting substantial treatment challenges. The current standard treatment, which includes surgical resection followed by temozolomide and radiation, offers limited success. While immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have proven effective in other cancers, they have not demonstrated significant efficacy in GBM. Emerging research highlights the pivotal role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in supporting tumor growth, fostering treatment resistance, and shaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Preclinical studies show promising results for therapies targeting TAMs, suggesting potential in overcoming these barriers. TAMs consist of brain-resident microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages, both exhibiting diverse phenotypes and functions within the tumor microenvironment. This review delves into the origin, heterogeneity, and functional roles of TAMs in GBM, underscoring their dual roles in tumor promotion and suppression. It also summarizes recent progress in TAM-targeted therapies, which may, in combination with other treatments like immunotherapy, pave the way for more effective and personalized strategies against this aggressive malignancy.">

 Cutaneous melanoma develops from precursor cells that progress to melanoma in situ (MIS) and eventually to invasive disease. In metastatic tumors, cells switch from a melanocytic to an undifferentiated, and neural crest (NC)-like state, which is associated with metastasis and therapeutic resistance. However, it is unclear whether these cell states or gene expression changes occur at the premetastatic stage or if they are associated with features of the local tumor microenvironment (TME). We analyzed a cohort of 62 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma (stages 0-III), using cyclic multiplex immunofluorescence imaging (CyCIF), and spatial transcriptomics to assess the molecular and TME changes that occur during the transitions from normal to precursor lesions, MIS and invasive melanoma. The loss of MART1 was associated with increased NGFR expression and elevated proliferation (KI67) in thicker tumors compared to thin (<1mm) lesions. Various tumor cell states coexisted in close proximity within early-stage, untreated melanomas. These tumor states were not arranged by depth of invasion but were associated with specific immune and stromal cell niches. Using CyCIF, we quantified the spatial heterogeneity of tumor cell states at whole-slide, microregion, and single-cell levels by calculating spatial entropy. We found that samples with a range of spatial entropy values contained both regions of high and low local neighborhood Shannon entropy at the single cell level. High spatial heterogeneity at the protein level was associated with enrichment of interferon gamma and alpha pathway transcripts. We also identified that transcriptomic heterogeneity within a single primary melanoma sample could be just as varied as across the entire cohort, with microregions showing distinct morphologic and spatial features. To understand the gene expression changes leading to intratumoral heterogeneity, we applied a self-organizing map to the spatial transcriptomic data to determine a developmental trajectory from melanocytic atypia to invasion. We discovered that tumor cells in invasive regions followed two developmental branches, characterized by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, interferon response pathways, and dedifferentiation signatures. These developmental branches also showed differences in the local TME composition and the depth of invasion. Our multi-omic analyses reveal that a spectrum of tumor states exists even in early-stage primary cutaneous melanomas, suggesting an association between these tumor states and TME niches.

        <tr id="Studying the spatial distribution of cell types in tissues is essential for understanding their function in health and disease. A widely used spatial feature for quantifying tissue organization is the pairwise neighbor preference (NEP) of cell types, commonly referred to as co-occurrence or colocalization. Various methods to infer NEP have proved their utility in spatial omics studies, but despite their broad usage, no clear guidelines exist for selecting one method over the other. In this paper, we deconstruct frequently used methods into their underlying analysis steps and evaluate their optimal combination. We studied the methods on two aspects: (1) their discriminatory power to distinguish different tissue architectures and (2) their ability to recover the directionality of NEPs. We compared existing as well as our in-house developed method (conditional z-score (COZI)) and compared their performance using in silico tissue simulations and demonstrated its biological applicability in a myocardial infarction dataset. Overall, our study serves as a comprehensive guide for users and method developers in spatial omics analysis and offers a novel approach (COZI), which outperforms existing methods, to performing NEP analysis.">

        <tr id="Background Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (eCCA) is a rare but refractory cancer with dense desmoplasia. Prognosis-associated stromal cells in eCCA remain poorly characterized. Here, we profiled the tumor cellular composition and identified prognosis-related stromal signatures by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in eCCA. ECCA patients were further stratified into different categories based on identified stromal signatures. Methods Using scRNA-seq, we profiled the transcriptomes of 37,498 individual cells from eight eCCA biopsies, including five tumor tissues and three paired adjacent normal tissues. Bulk RNA sequencing (bRNA-seq) was also performed on 43 eCCA tumor tissues. Stromal cell composition and heterogeneity were examined through differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analyses. By assessing the expression levels of marker genes in bRNA-seq data, the correlation of stromal cell clusters with survival was explored. The GSVA scores of the cell-specific signature genes of the prognosis-related stromal cell subtypes were calculated and used to stratify eCCA patients. Results The results revealed that tumor stroma in eCCA were composed of hematopoietic progenitor-like cells (HPLCs), fibroblasts (Fb), Schwann cells (Sch), endothelial cells and immune cells. Prognosis-associated stromal cell subpopulations included MKI67 + HPLC, TMEM158 + C3-Fb, FOXP3 + regulatory T cells (Treg), SLIT2 + Sch, TPSD1 + C2-mast cells (MC) and CTSG + C3-MC. Based on these stromal signatures, the eCCA tumors were categorized into three classes: proliferative Group 1 with enrichment of MKI67 + HPLC, inflammatory and fibrotic Group 2 with enrichment of TPSD1 + C2- MC, FOXP3 + Treg and TMEM158 + C3-Fb, and neuronal Group 3 with enrichment of SLIT2 + Sch and CTSG + C3-MC. ECCA patients in Group 3 had a better prognosis when compared to Group 1 and 2, reflecting different impact of stromal subtypes on tumor progression. Conclusion Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals prognosis-related stromal signatures that potentiate the stratification of eCCA into proliferative, inflammatory and fibrotic, and neuronal phenotypes, which has important implications on molecular classification and exploring therapeutic targets in eCCA.

 Spatial Multiomics allows for context-based study of the tumor microenvironment (TME). TME consists of diverse cells that collectively influence tumor progression, therapeutic response, and immune activation. CD8 T-cells, essential for antitumor immunity, often become exhausted in the TME. Recent studies show that PD1+ TCF1+ stem-like CD8 T-cells retain differentiation potential and can be rejuvenated through cytokine signaling and immune checkpoint modulation. This detailed spatial profiling of RNA and protein expression in the TME is crucial to understanding immune cell function, activation, and differentiation. Here we introduce a protease-free workflow for RNAscope™ Multiplex Fluorescent v2 assay combining RNA in-situ hybridization (ISH) and protein immunofluorescence to study cell marker proteins (CD8, PD1) with RNA targets (TNFA, TCF7, IFNG) in a tumor microarray (TMA). The Manual Multiplex Protease-Free workflow enables simultaneous RNA and protein visualization without enzymatic disruption, preserving antigen integrity and tissue morphology. Using this Multiomics assay we can study CD8 T-cell differentiation and activation. Co-detection of TNFA, TCF7, and IFNG transcripts with CD8 and PD1 proteins provides insights into specific T cell phenotypes and their activation/exhaustion status. Data reveal robust co-expression patterns of these targets, particularly in the tumor-cell neighboring stromal and immune cells in breast, cervical and stomach cancers, reflecting immune activation and exhaustion across distinct TME niches. This methodology lays a foundation for refining immunotherapeutic strategies targeting PD1+ TCF7+ CD8 T-cells, enhancing effector functions, and advancing precision oncology interventions.

Here, Ding and colleagues introduce multiomics and ecological spatial analysis (MESA), an ecology-inspired framework that integrates spatial and single-cell expression data to quantify tissue diversity across multiple scales. MESA both identifies distinct cellular neighborhoods and computes a variety of diversity metrics alongside the identification of diversity "hotspots". Applied to human tonsil tissue, MESA revealed previously undetected germinal center organization, while in spleen tissue of a murine lupus model, MESA highlights increasing cellular diversity with disease progression. Importantly, diversity hotspots do not correspond to conventional compartments identified by existing methods, presenting an orthogonal metric of spatial organization. In colorectal cancer, MESA's diversity metrics outperformed established subtypes at predicting patient survival, while in hepatocellular carcinoma, multi-omic integration identified significantly more ligand-receptor interactions between immune cells compared to single-modality analysis. This work establishes cellular diversity within tissues as a critical correlate of disease progression and underscores the value of multi-omic integration in spatial biology.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the highest mortality rate among major cancers, with over 50% of patients having liver metastases at diagnosis. Given that conventional T-cell based immunotherapies have been ineffective against PDAC liver metastases, it is vital to elucidate the mechanisms regulating tumor immunity within the hepatic microenvironment to enhance anti-tumor T cell. Notably, PDAC cells exhibit exceptional plasticity and intrinsic heterogeneity, contributing to the evolution of immunosuppressive primary and early liver PDAC metastases. Our study leverages an array of congenic PDAC clones with varying degrees of immunogenicity to delineate the signaling pathways driving primary and liver immunosuppression.



 We investigate the growth kinetics of PDAC clones both in vitro and in vivo, alongside their transcriptomic variations. Using model antigens (chicken ovalbumin), we assess how different clones modulate the immune microenvironment to elicit antigen-specific adaptive anti-tumor responses. Transcriptomic profiling informs CRISPR-based knockout and overexpression strategies to uncover intrinsic gene contributions to primary anti-tumor immunity in vivo. Additionally, we have developed stable PDAC liver metastasis models through portal vein injection to evaluate each clone’s metastatic efficiency and associated immune landscape within the hepatic microenvironment.



 In vivo engraftment of PDAC clones revealed differential infiltration of CD4+/CD8+ T cells and neutrophils. While all OVA+ PDAC clones triggered antigen-specific immune responses, only immune-sensitive tumors were eradicated, whereas immune-insensitive tumors persisted. Despite OVA expression, all clones successfully established liver metastases following intraportal injection. RNA-seq analysis identified upregulation of key pancreatic development regulators, including PDX1 and RBPJ, in immune-insensitive clones. CRISPR knockout of these transcription factors in vivo demonstrated altered immune cell composition and reduced tumor growth in immunocompetent mice expressing OVA.



 Using diverse PDAC models, we created tumors with immune heterogeneity and altered transcriptional profiles. We identified validated immune-altering cytokines (CXCL1 and CSF3) and immunomodulatory roles of PDX1 and RBPJ. Immune-insensitive clones evaded antigen-specific immunity in both subcutaneous and liver metastasis models, while immune-sensitive clones were eradicated subcutaneously but gained protection in the liver. Ongoing studies confirm the phenotypes of CRISPR-KO clones and delineate the immunomodulatory roles of these transcription factors in liver metastasis.

Increasing evidence suggests that GBM’s aggressiveness, invasiveness, and therapy resistance are driven by glioma stem cells (GSCs), a subpopulation of tumor cells that share molecular and functional characteristics with neural stem cells (NSCs). GSCs are heterogeneous and highly plastic. They evade conventional treatments by shifting their state and entering in quiescence, where they become metabolically inactive and resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. GSCs can exit quiescence and be reactivated to divide into highly proliferative tumor cells which contributes to recurrence. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating the biology of GSCs, their plasticity, and the switch between quiescence and mitotic activity is essential to shape new therapeutic strategies. This review examines the latest evidence on GSC biology, their role in glioblastoma progression and recurrence, emerging therapeutic approaches aimed at disrupting their proliferation and survival, and the mechanisms underlying their resistance to therapy.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a treatment-refractory malignancy with a dismal prognosis. Targeting cancer cell plasticity—the capacity to adapt to cell-extrinsic pressure via non-genetic mechanisms—is a promising therapeutic strategy, yet cell states within PDAC harboring high plasticity remain poorly understood. Using genetically engineered mouse models driven by oncogenic KrasG12D and loss of p53 (“KPC” model), we profiled primary PDAC tumors using single-cell RNA sequencing and single cell ATAC sequencing. We find that the KPC model harbors a basal state, which harbors transcriptional signature that aligns with the “basal” signature in human PDAC and is linked to poor prognosis and chemoresistance. The basal state co-expresses both epithelial and mesenchymal programs and has a distinct epigenetic landscape with accessible chromatin across gene sets that mark cancer cell states with divergent phenotypes, suggesting that this cell state is primed for cell state switching. To functionally interrogate the basal state in PDAC progression, we developed a novel lineage-tracing and ablation system. Lineage-tracing experiments revealed that the basal state has a robust capacity for differentiation into epithelial and mesenchymal states, indicating that the basal state is functionally plastic and acts as a source of fixed malignant states. Strikingly, targeted elimination of the basal state over short time periods resulted in tumor collapse, underscoring a critical role in tumor maintenance. Further, we found that the basal state is highly dependent on KRAS activity, with acute KRAS inhibitor treatment leading to a selective depletion of the basal state. Taken together, our data indicates that PDAC harbors a striking dependency on the basal state and encourages therapeutic approaches aimed at eradicating this critical subset of cancer cells.

 The efficacy of treating colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases is hindered by significant tumor heterogeneity, both within and between tumors. This diversity stems from varied cell populations and complex interactions in the tumor microenvironment, necessitating a deeper understanding of spatial organization and cellular communication patterns.



 We examined 23 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 11 patients, comprising primary lesions and matched liver metastasis (6 with synchronous and 5 with metachronous metastases) using NanoString 6K CosMx Spatial Molecular Imaging (SMI). Pathologists selected optimal fields of view at tumor invasive fronts. Image processing, cell segmentation, and feature extraction utilized an in-house CosMx SMI pipeline with the Cellpose algorithm. Following quality control, the remaining cells underwent unsupervised clustering with differential gene expression analysis and cell-to-cell interaction analyses performed using the Seurat R package.



 Analysis of 105, 624 high-quality cells revealed 23 distinct clusters, categorized as ten epithelial tumors, three cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), two endothelial cells, five immune cells (T cell, Monocyte, Macrophage, SPP1+ Macrophage, and Plasma cell), alveolar cells, hepatocytes, and low complexity cell populations. We identified significant differences in gene expression between colon and liver CAFs, with liver CAFs displaying upregulation of 92 genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Enhanced communication between CAFs, T cells, and macrophages was observed in liver metastases, with specific ligand-receptor pairs (SPP1-ITGA4/ITGB1, LGALS9-P4HB, LGALS9-CD44, CXCL12-CXCR4) enriched in the metastatic microenvironment.



 Our findings demonstrate distinct spatial heterogeneity and intercellular communication networks in CRC liver metastases. The identification of liver-specific CAF gene expression profiles and unique ligand-receptor interactions provides new insights into metastatic mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

 Recurrence and metastasis following curative treatment remain significant challenges in colorectal cancer (CRC). Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are pivotal in the dissemination of cancer, leading to distant metastases and eventual recurrence. Despite their importance, the cellular lineages driving these processes in CRC remain poorly defined. POU5F1, a transcription factor associated with stemness, is highly expressed in recurrent CRC tumors and is linked to poor prognosis and a high incidence of liver metastasis.



 We developed a patient-derived cancer cell model, termed isolated tumor-derived cancer cells, cultured as two-dimensional organoids (2DOs). These 2DOs retain tumor heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment interactions, providing a robust platform for investigating treatment-resistant lineages. Using EGFP-reporter 2DOs, POU5F1-expressing cells were isolated and characterized through drug sensitivity assays, single-cell RNA sequencing, immunocytochemistry, and epigenetic analyses. Therapeutic studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of targeting key pathways.



 POU5F1-expressing cells were highly enriched in blood samples from relapsed CRC patients as CTCs. These cells exhibited cancer stem cell properties, including self-renewal and differentiation, and demonstrated a high capacity for liver metastasis in vivo. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that POU5F1-positive cells generate heterogeneous populations enriched in the Wnt signaling pathway. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the co-expression of POU5F1 and CTLA4, with epigenetic analysis showing demethylation at transcriptional start sites of both genes, implicating epigenetic regulation in their aggressiveness. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor XAV939 effectively suppressed adhesion and survival of POU5F1-positive cells in vitro. Remarkably, early administration of XAV939 completely inhibited liver metastasis induced by these cells in vivo.



 POU5F1-expressing cells are critical drivers of CRC metastasis and recurrence, exhibiting stem-like properties and treatment resistance. Their enrichment in Wnt signaling and CTLA4 expression identifies actionable therapeutic targets. Our findings highlight the potential of Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors like XAV939 to prevent CRC metastasis and recurrence, paving the way for improved therapeutic strategies in high-risk patients.

        <tr id="The study of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) provides critical insights into the biological mechanisms underlying metastasis. This study aims to demonstrate the applicability of an integrated DEPArray-based phenotypic analysis combined with transcriptomic characterization to investigate the biology of CTCs isolated from 10 patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The transcriptional profiles of CTCs were consistent with both the cancer type and epithelial characteristics. Gene set enrichment analysis identified pathways associated with synapse organization and calcium channel activity. Furthermore, distinct gene expression profiles were linked to specific metastatic sites, particularly bone metastases. We also report a rare and understudied population of CTCs, characterized by the co-expression of epithelial and leukocyte markers, observed exclusively in patient-derived samples and not in blood samples from healthy volunteers spiked with SKBR-3 and MCF-7 cell lines. This suggests that these double-positive CTCs (dpCTCs) may have a specific role in the metastatic process. The transcriptomic characterization of these rare CTCs enhances our understanding of their biology and potential involvement in metastasis. As a pilot study, our findings underscore the potential of CTC-based transcriptomics as a valuable tool for advancing clinical and biological understanding of MBC, particularly regarding metastatic mechanisms and organotropism. Moreover, it provides preliminary insights into dpCTCs, a poorly characterized population that may play a pivotal role in metastasis but remains largely unexplored. These findings could pave the way for developing targeted therapies aimed at the pathways driving metastasis and for improving patient monitoring through CTC profiling.

 A deeper understanding of the intricacies between tumor microenvironments (TMEs) and immune cell infiltrates is critical for creation of next generation immune modulating therapies. We previously validated a clinical grade, 17 plex tumor immune landscape assay which characterizes T cells, B cells, myeloid cells, plasma cells, and tumor cells across five major cancer types. This assay was developed on the Orion platform, which images up to 18 markers concurrently and allows for same slide hematoxylin and eosin (H and E). Using the Orion platform, we characterized the TME through two approaches: cellular neighborhoods and clustering based on H and E and segmented fluorescent immunohistochemistry data. Our findings elucidate innovative strategies for leveraging high dimensional data from Orion to uncover clinically useful insights, opening new avenues for understanding mechanism of response or resistance in next generation immune oncology (IO) clinical trials



 We designed a mFIHC assay (Granzyme B, Ki67, CD3e, CD20, CD4, CD163, CD8a, CD56, PDL1, PD1, LAG3, FOXP3, CD11b, CD138, SOX10, Cytokeratin and Hoechst) to evaluate expression of immune markers on non small cell lung cancer, breast carcinoma, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma. After the initial evaluation, we validated the mFIHC assay for clinical trial use with automated staining (IntelliPath FLX) and imaging (Orion). Image analysis was conducted using HALO technologies.



 HALO analysis revealed distinct tumor immune microenvironments in the examined tissues. Microenvironment data were assessed by analyzing immune cell infiltration alongside immune activation markers. Our analysis revealed unique cell clusters in these microenvironments.



 Our clinically validated 17 plex mFIHC assay, combined with advanced spatial algorithms, offers improved characterization of the TME. We expect these novel algorithms to contribute to gaining novel insights into tumor biology and development of next generation IO therapies.

 Colorectal cancer is the second most fatal cancer worldwide, accounting for 9% of all reported cancer deaths, and is the number one cause of death among people under the age of 50. Rapid technical advances in the field of spatial biology are allowing us to gain new insight into colorectal cancer biology and patient heterogeneity, which can help to guide the development of immunotherapies. Using a combination of modalities such as sequential multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) and spatial transcriptomics (STx) on a colon cancer sample we determined the spatial distribution, phenotype, function, and a cytokine and chemokine profile within the colon cancer tissue.



 5 um FFPE sections were prepared from a colon cancer sample exhibiting moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of T3, N0 staging. mIF was performed using Lunaphore COMET with a 20-antibody panel, followed by H&E staining and imaging. An adjacent section was used for STx with the 10x Genomics Visium CytAssist platform. Data was analyzed with Lunaphore Horizon®, 10x Genomics Loupe Browser software and PredxBio SpaceIQ™ unbiased cell typing, microdomain discovery and network biology platform that co-analyzes mIF and STx datasets.



 The tumor showed an aberrant growth pattern and a highly proliferated crypt region. Three distinct microdomains in the tumor tissue were discovered: one with high levels of PD-L1+ cells, a second with high levels of NK cells and a third with low levels of infiltrating cells in the lumen and crypt. There was significant presence of VISTA+ and IDO1+ cells throughout the lumen. These cells interacted with CD4+ and CD8+ cells which were found to be present in both lumen and crypt regions. PD-L1 was prominent in the cells found in both lumen and crypt. Finally, NK cells were abundant throughout the lumen and in regions adjacent to the crypt.



 Using multimodal spatial imaging and spatial co-analysis of mIF and STx data, we were able to elucidate relationships between different cell types in a complex tumor tissue and assign context to their activities. Despite high levels of NK cells, indicative of a possible active anti-tumor immune response, the tumor has developed an immune evasion mechanism due to the presence of cells expressing high levels of the anti-tumor immune response markers such as PD-L1, IDO1, and VISTA. Based on these results, therapies targeting more than one immune checkpoint protein may yield improved response due to an abundance of the existing NK cells. The transcriptomic profiling reveals a complex relationship between various cytokines secreted by different cell populations which alter the landscape of the tumor microenvironment, facilitating the emergence of an immunosuppressive phenotype.

        <tr id="Intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) poses a challenge for treatment decisions, made more complex by its heterogeneous nature. Growing evidence highlights the critical role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), in cancer initiation, progression, and response to treatment, underscoring the importance of profiling cancer cells but also the TME within their spatial context. Here, we present single-cell in situ transcriptomic and spatial proteomics results from 300 intermediate-risk PCa prostatectomy samples. Multiple regions of the prostate, including regions of the index lesion, secondary lesions, regions of benign and normal were sampled then analyzed using Bruker’s CosMx SMI platform for a 6000-plex RNA assay in a subset of patients; in addition to proteomic profiling using the GeoMx DSP platform. Clustering assigned cells into 15 cell types based on their transcriptional profiles. Each cell type was tested for significantly different proportions in tumor versus non-tumor samples. The cell type with the greatest bias had a 9-fold greater proportion in tumor samples (adjusted P < 0.01). ERG, largely associated with the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in PCa, was most specifically expressed in cells of this type. Conversely, the cell type with the greatest bias towards non-tumor samples (3-fold greater proportion, adjusted P < 0.01) is characterized most specifically by the expression of MSMB, which encodes an immunoglobulin binding factor previously found to have decreased expression in PCa. Other evidence of intratumoral heterogeneity was found in samples that are not dominated by these stereotypical cell types. For example, a relatively higher-grade sample from an index tumor possessed high proportion of the tumor-dominant cell type whereas a relatively lower-grade sample from the same tumor did not. Similarly, the tumor and non-tumor samples arising from the same patient showed similar cell type composition, highlighting inter-patient heterogeneity. Moreover, we identified proteins with significantly different expression in tumor versus non-tumor samples. In the TME, EpCAM and CD56 were significantly overexpressed and underexpressed in tumor versus non-tumor regions, respectively (adjusted P < 0.01). In the epithelium, cleaved caspase-9, which initiates the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis, was the most significantly underexpressed protein in tumor samples (adjusted P < 0.01). However, the expression of the mRNA encoding caspase-9 is not highly correlated with the expression of cleaved caspase-9, highlighting the added benefit of protein expression profiling. Taken together, this multi-modal spatial analysis of multiple samples from the same PCa patients facilitates a detailed understanding of early PCa for biomarker discovery and pathways of therapeutic intervention.

 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents a major medical challenge due to its aggressive progression and a dismal 5-year overall survival rate of only 7%. While SCLC initially responds well to chemotherapy, the rapid relapse and emergence of therapy-resistant tumors remain critical barriers to effective treatment. We hypothesized that therapy response is associated with genome evolution, which, in turn, influences transcriptional plasticity. This study aims to decipher the clonal evolution and transcriptomic adaptations in response to chemotherapy in SCLC.



 We established over 100 patient-derived xenotransplant models from clinical SCLC specimens, capturing diverse genetic features and clinical characteristics. A representative subset of 33 models was selected to replicate clinical scenarios in mice, modeling the effects of platinum-based chemotherapy and evaluating tumor responses under controlled conditions. Whole-exome sequencing and single-cell transcriptome profiling were performed to investigate genomic evolutionary trajectories and transcriptional plasticity in therapy-naïve and relapsed tumors.



 Xenotransplant models accurately reflect patient responses to chemotherapy. To our surprise, several models from relapsed patients retained sensitivity to treatment. Chemotherapy-resistant models maintain their tumor clones, whereas sensitive models show dynamic shifts from a common ancestral clone with emerging subclones shaped by mutations associated with platinum damage, APOBEC activity, and defective DNA damage repair. The genomic landscape, defined by subclonal mutations and copy number alterations, strongly impacts transcriptomic patterns. Specifically sensitive models post-chemotherapy reveal a strong shift of transcriptional programs reflecting adaptive plasticity as a consequence of genome evolution.



 Here we provide an in-depth functional in vivo characterization of clonal adaptions in SCLC under therapy. Chemotherapy drives the selection of subclones with favorable genomic features, which in turn impact the broader transcriptomic landscape. Our data provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms of therapy resistance.

 Background:
 Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that engage in direct cytotoxic responses against malignant cells and promote pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironments. While studies have predominantly focused on conventional NK cell subsets, recent findings uncovered adaptive and tissue-resident (TR) subsets with unique functional properties. The influence of distinct NK cell subsets on tumor immunobiology and clinical outcomes remains unknown.
 Methods:
 Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of primary, therapy-naïve tumors from 276 patients across 14 cancer types, as well as 39 patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), was accessed through publicly available datasets. We employed systematic computational analyses to phenotype and examine intra-tumoral NK cells. Gene signatures for NK cell subsets were applied to bulk RNA-sequencing from 212,105 tumor samples to delineate their associations with clinical outcomes using the Caris CODEai database.
 Results:
 Six main subsets of NK cells were identified in solid tumors, including conventional CD56
 dim
 and CD56
 bright
 NK cells, alongside adaptive, TR adaptive, TR CD56
 bright
 , and TR CD56
 bright
 /adaptive subsets. Across cancer, TR adaptive NK cells emerged as the most prognostic subset, with high infiltration conferring significantly longer overall survival (HR[95% CI] = 0.68[0.66-0.69], p < 0.001) than conventional CD56
 dim
 and CD56
 bright
 subsets. This was also observed in cohorts of head and neck, non-small cell lung, and esophageal cancers, particularly those treated with ICB. Notably, elevated TR adaptive NK cell infiltration was more prognostic than high tumor mutational burden in these settings. This was most apparent in ICB-treated head and neck cancers (HR = 0.48[0.41-0.57], p < 0.001 vs HR = 0.90[0.76-1.04], p = 0.16). Additionally, TR adaptive NK cells were strongly correlated to the infiltration of CD8
 +
 T cells and B cells in tumors. Underlying these observations, our scRNA-seq analyses demonstrated that TR adaptive NK cells exhibit the highest immunomodulatory activity of all subsets, expressing high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (
 CCL3
 ,
 CXCL13
 , and
 IFNG
 ) and low levels of immunosuppressive cytokines (
 TGFB1
 ). Mechanistically, this activity was linked to the upregulation of transcription factors associated with NK cell activation, function, and persistence and downregulation of genes related to stress response and exhaustion. Interestingly, scRNA-seq from paired pre- and post-ICB-treated tumors revealed a unique expansion of cytotoxic
 GZMB
 + TR adaptive NK cells after treatment.
 Conclusions:
 TR adaptive NK cells represent a novel subset of NK cells that may drive anti-tumor immune responses, particularly in the context of ICB treatment. Features of this unique population may be harnessed to design more effective NK cell-based therapies against solid tumors.

 Dynamic adaptations in cancer cell-state due to therapy is a growing concern. Despite multimodal clinical therapy, tumor cells surpass treatment resulting in frequent relapses in rapidly decreasing timeline. We have shown that, in accordance with therapy pressure associated tumor microenvironment, progressive disease (PD) cells exhibit reversible lineage transformation and unparalleled plasticity. However, our understanding of the genetic determinant(s) and/ or mechanism(s) that coordinate cancer cell plasticity is a far reach. Herein, we investigated the crucial cancer cell phenotypic switching in response to therapy pressure. Using a panel of 14 well characterized human neuroblastoma (NB) cells derived during diagnosis (Dx) and PD, we investigated the association of retinal degeneration protein 3 (RD3) status (ELISA) to their migratory and invasive capabilities (transwell assay), clonal expansion (BrDu), EMT (E-CAD, N-CAD, Vimentin, SLUG), metastatic state (Ron-β, MMP-9, MMP-2), stemness maintenance (CD133, CD117, CD114, Oct3/4, Sox2, NANOG, CD54, NOTCH1) and cellular dedifferentiation (β-3 tubulin, NF-L, GFAP, GAP43) (immunoblotting). Further, to investigate the function of RD3 in coordinating cancer cell plasticity, we utilized six select NB cells, three derived during Dx and three derived during PD, representing both primary and metastatic tumors. These patient derived cells were reverse engineered for stable expression of RD3 in RD3- PD cell lines; stable silencing of RD3 in RD3+ Dx cell lines and were subjected to end-point readouts as above. RD3 loss in PD correlated with the increased cellular migration, invasion, metastatic potential, EMT and stemness maintenance. Directed simulation experiments with stable restoration and silencing systems clearly identified the function of RD3-loss in cancer cell plasticity by regulating stemness (ALDH, CD133), EMT (Vimentin, E-CAD, N-CAD), metastasis (Ron-β, MMP-9), pluripotency maintenance (Oct3/4, Sox2, NANOG), dedifferentiation (β-3 tubulin, NF-H, GFAP, GAP43) and clonal expansion (BrDu). Our findings for the first time identified the defined function and relevance of RD3 in regulating cancer cell EMT, stemness and pluripotency maintenance, metastatic state and prompting differentiation. Crucially, our findings recognized therapy pressure directed RD3 loss dictates cancer cell lineage transformation to cancer stem cells. These outcomes together pave way to develop novel and effective molecular-targeted maintenance therapeutic strategy for patients presented with therapy defying progressive disease.

 Esophageal adenocarcinoma is a prevalent and serious disease, ranking eighth globally, with a low survival rate of 15-25% and a rising incidence in the United States. However, the occurrence of brain metastasis in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is rare, affecting only approximately 2-6%. Despite its rarity, brain metastasis in EAC is associated with a poor prognosis, compounded by the limited availability of effective treatment options. Due to the infrequent occurrence of brain metastasis in EAC patients, our understanding of the tumor composition in these cases and how they differ from those in primary sites remains limited. To address these gaps, we analyzed the tumor microenvironment of brain metastasis tumors and their matched primary tumors using spatial transcriptomic data generated by the 10x Xenium Analyzer. By employing a brain tumor panel, an immune panel, and a custom panel, we characterized the tumor microenvironment, including neuronal and immune cell populations present in these samples. Overall, primary samples contained a higher proportion of immune cells such as macrophages, T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, plasma cells, and mast cells, compared to brain metastases, which had a greater composition of neuronal cells. We additionally investigated the oncogenic expression patterns at the single-cell level within these matched samples, revealing areas with high ERBB2 and EGFR expression density within malignant cell populations. Notably, brain metastasis samples contained a higher proportion of malignant cells co-expressing ERBB2 and EGFR than primary samples, suggesting clonal evolution during disease progression from primary to metastatic sites. Our findings indicate that ERBB2 and EGFR amplifications may represent potential targets for therapeutic interventions in these patients. These findings enhance our understanding of brain metastasis in EAC, offering insights into the tumor microenvironment that may guide future therapeutic strategies and improve clinical management for this previously understudied metastatic type.

 Molecular subtyping of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has converged on basal-like and classical subtypes with the former being associated with worse prognosis. Sequencing-based tools have emerged to bring PDAC subtyping closer to incorporation into clinical practice. We sought to test the utility of PDAC subtyping using a cohort of patient tumor samples in a clinical setting. For 29 patients with resectable PDAC, two formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks were sequenced from each patient tumor sample (total n=58 blocks) using Nanostring nCounter. 18/58 (31%) of tumors had inconsistent PurIST-based basal-like or classical labels between the two blocks. Two tumors were selected for digital spatial transcriptomics based on having either consistent or inconsistent subtype labelling. Regions of interest (ROI) were selected to capture a diverse range of cellular compartments within the tumor microenvironment including tumor, stroma, immune cells, tumor buds and neurons. ROIs were sequenced across two and three FFPE blocks from the subtype consistent and inconsistent tumors, respectively. Gene expression was segmented by PanCK positive (epithelial) and negative (non-epithelial) signal. Across all ROIs (n=35), PanCK+ segments showed higher expression of basal-like (p=1.9e-7) and classical (p=4.2e-9) genes compared to PanCK- segments. For the subtype-consistent (classical) tumor, all ROIs (n=13) across two blocks showed predominate classical gene expression in the PanCK+ segment. In the subtype-inconsistent tumor that originally had blocks labelled PurIST classical and intermediate, ROIs (n=22) taken across three blocks showed 50, 60 and 83% of ROIs having higher basal-like expression, while remaining ROIs had predominant classical gene expression, and log2 fold change basal-like vs. classical (median) gene expression ranged from -2.4 (T-cells) to 1.3 (tumor and stroma) across ROIs. Overall, the classical gene signature was positively correlated with GATA6 expression (rho=0.40, p=3.2e-4) across all ROIs and PanCK segmentations. While these data support the notion of subtyping expression being specific to the tumor epithelial component, nearly one-third of patient samples had different subtype labels depending on which area of the tumor epithelium was captured. We demonstrate the ability for spatial transcriptomics to resolve subtype heterogeneity and the contributing cellular compartments, providing potential to better understand how aggressive disease develops and could be treated.

 Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most prevalent and lethal cancer types worldwide. However, our understanding of the transition from normal-appearing tissue (NAT) to adenomatous lung premalignant lesions (aPMLs) and LUADs, particularly within a spatial context, remains limited. This study aims to address this gap by systemically analyzing the pathologic continuum of NAT > aPML > LUAD using spatial transcriptomics (ST).



 High-resolution spatial profiling was conducted on 56 samples from 25 patients with paired aPMLs and LUADs using the Visium ST platform. Non-negative matrix factorization was conducted to identify transcriptional programs for each sample, following clustering analysis to define consensus metaprograms across the cohort. Additionally, spatial molecular imaging was performed on an expanded cohort of 188 cores arranged into eight tissue microarrays using the Xenium in situ platform with a customized lung cancer gene panel to establish a single-cell spatial atlas of the disease continuum and systemically investigate spatial organization, cellular neighborhoods and interactions.



 Eight distinct metaprograms (MP1∼8) were identified, distinguishing stromal (MP2), myeloid (MP4), lymphoid (MP6), and epithelial (MP3, MP5) compartments. Additionally, metaprograms were identified for the lung capillary bed (MP7), stressed cellular state (MP8), and mosaic cellular patterns (MP1). These metaprograms correlated strongly with pathological annotations and captured fine tissue structures like lymphoid aggregates. LUADs and aPMLs showed distinct MP profiles, with MP3 and MP6 being highly abundant in LUADs, while MP1, MP4, MP5 and MP7 were more abundant in aPMLs. Specifically, we observed positive correlations between MP3 and MP6, as well as between MP4 and MP5 in sample distributions, indicating co-evolution of tumor and immune microenvironments during disease progression. Xenium data complemented these findings by revealing distinct compositions of microenvironmental cellular states and tumor neighborhood structures across aPML and LUAD lesions. A total of 44 cell states were defined. Specifically, NK cells were depleted in aPMLs and LUADs compared with NAT, accompanied by an enrichment of regulatory T cells and myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the latter. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cellular subsets, including IL1B+ macrophages and IL6+ inflammatory CAFs were more abundant in tumor neighborhoods of aPMLs compared to LUADs, potentially contributing to the pre-malignant to malignant transition.



 This study offers a comprehensive molecular and cellular landscape of aPML and LUAD, laying a crucial foundation for future mechanistic studies aimed at early disease interception.

 The tumor microenvironment consists of different cell populations, whose interactions contribute to tumor heterogeneity and plasticity and pose challenges to therapy efficacy and prognosis prediction. Breast cancer is one of the highly heterogeneous diseases, and estrogen receptor (ER) positive subtype, the most common one, shows worse prognosis once metastasized. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is emerging as a powerful tool that offers valuable insights into spatial complexity of tumor microenvironment as well as the cell interactions underpinning tumor heterogeneity. In this study, we aimed to examine tumor heterogeneity of ER positive metastatic breast cancer by applying our geographic information science (GIS)-augmented ST analysis pipeline. Visium datasets were prepared from four metastatic liver tumors from xenograft mouse model and twelve primary and metastatic bone tumors from human patients, including three matching pairs. We integrated geospatial tools, such as multivariate spatial association analysis, with spatial omics data structures to check degree of auto-correlations and visualize localizations of single gene or gene sets. We further compensated for multi-cellular resolution of our spatial data via cell type mapping and deconvolution of cell type proportion (STdeconvolve). We identified hotspot regions displaying extensive co-localization between estrogen response gene set and lipid metabolism gene sets in the fulvestrant-treated metastatic liver tumors from xenograft mouse model. These hotspots were not concentrated in the same area within the tumor and differed by gene sets, suggesting intra-tumor metabolic heterogeneity of the endocrine responsive cells. Our primary samples from human patients showed similar pattern of co-occurrence between estrogen response and metabolic programs as well as cell-cycle related gene sets. On the other hand, mutual exclusivity was observed for estrogen response with immune-related gene sets and metastasis-related ones (epithelial mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis). Compared to primary tumors, metastatic bone tumors showed inter-tumor heterogeneity as such consistency in spatial pattern was obscured. Deconvoluting cell type proportions mapped a higher proportion of mature luminal cells in endocrine responsive hotspots, whereas cancer associated fibroblasts and pericytes were prevalent in the hotspots of metastasis-related gene sets. Our study fully utilized the potential power of ST data by delineating the tumor microenvironment in relation to intra-tumoral heterogeneity as well as cell type proportions. Findings from our study support the development of strategies to target different endocrine resistant cell populations with a combination of metabolic and metastasis-related signaling inhibitors.

        <tr id="Tumor microenvironment (TME) is characterized by complex cellular composition and high molecular heterogeneity. Characterizing the metabolic interactions between different cells in the TME is important for understanding the molecular signatures of tumors and identifying potential metabolic vulnerabilities for tumor treatment. In this research, we develop a single-cell spatial metabolomics method to profile cell-specific metabolic signatures and cell-cell metabolic interactions using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). Different low-molecular-weight metabolites and lipids including glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, taurine, phenylalanine, glutathione, fatty acids, phospholipids, etc. were successfully detected and imaged after optimizing cell culture conductive slides, cell washing, and fixation procedures. Subsequently, we carried out single-cell spatial metabolomics on H460 large-cell lung cancer cells, HT-29 colorectal cancer cells, A549 lung cancer cells, HUH-7 liver cancer cells, and cancer-fibroblasts coculture system. We revealed that the metabolic profiles of both cancer cells and fibroblasts were altered after cell coculture. Glutamate and aspartate significantly increased in fibroblasts after coculture with cancer cells, corresponding to their indispensable roles in the creation of pro-cancer microenvironment. In addition, we discovered that the expressions of fatty acids and phospholipids in tumor cells and fibroblasts were also changed after cell coculture, which is closely related to the competition for energy and nutrient metabolites between different cells. We anticipate this single-cell analysis method to be broadly used in the investigations of diverse cellular models and cell-cell metabolic interactions.">

        <tr id="Cell therapies have been groundbreaking for B-cell lymphomas but optimizing efficacy for solid tumors remains challenging. Lack of consensus on potency measures, unknowns about novel engineering strategies, and product heterogeneity drive extensive characterization to discover product-specific mechanisms of action (MoAs). This process is costly and limited by variable results from simple molecular assays and need to infer relationships between data from disparate technologies. Thus, we created a multi-modal technology with which to establish a multi-functional, longitudinal cellular characterization workflow. With a single sample input, this workflow evaluates multiple live phenotypes from the same individual cells across tens of thousands of cells at once. We leveraged TALL-104 cells before validating compatibility with clinical-stage cell therapies with AIC100 - a Phase 1 CAR-T product targeting thyroid cancer (NCT04420754). Cellanome’s technology enables multi-modal evaluation of live, cellular behavior at the resolution of single cells or single-cell interactions. Within an 8-lane flow cell, tens of thousands of single TALL-104 cells were enclosed with K562 target cells in bio-compatible hydrogel compartments called CellCage™ enclosures (CCEs). These CCEs enable longitudinal monitoring of single TALL-104 cells interacting with K562 cells for hours to days with time-lapse imaging. During this period, imaging-based evaluation of surface markers, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxicity are integrated from the same single T-cells. Our analysis pipeline links target cell death to single T cells in CCEs, enabling cell killing to be studied with unprecedented resolution. Similar to flow cytometry via CD107 as a surrogate for killing, with Cellanome’s technology, we could identify cytotoxic T cells (∼85%). Uniquely, we can directly evaluate killing by single TALL-104 cells and further segment them into groups. Group 1 consists of strong killers (killing 100% of targets), Group 2 of medium killers (50-99%), and Group 3 of weaker killers (0-49%). We next characterized single AIC100 cells enclosed with HeLa as targets and observed that, unlike TALL-104 cells where Group 2 was the largest, for AIC100, Group 3 was the largest, suggesting distinct killing mechanisms. Thus, we asked whether AIC100’s heterogeneous composition of CD4 / 8 cells impacts product efficacy. We configured this workflow to test killing by ∼100 combinations of CD4:CD8 AIC100 cells in a single experiment. Preliminarily, more killing occurred in CCEs containing a mixture of CD4 and CD8 T cells relative to CCEs containing only CD4 or CD8 cells. We are continuing to identify the optimal CD4:CD8 compositions for greater potency. We envision multi-modal characterization of clinical products with our platform, pre and post-patient infusion, will inform efforts to advance cell therapies for solid tumors.

 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal brain cancer. Standard of care treatments (SOC) are limited to surgery, radiation and chemotherapies, providing an average overall survival of only ∼16 months. Tumor heterogeneity and cellular plasticity are major contributions to treatment resistance in this disease. We constructed an integrated patient-level and cohort-level framework and analyzed single-nucleotide RNA sequencing data in matched primary and recurrence specimens to understand tumor heterogeneity, evolution, and drug resistance in SOC treated GBM patients (N=23). Patient-level tumor analysis revealed distinct tumor cell transcriptional subclones representing widespread intra-patient heterogeneity. Tumor evolution analysis from primary to recurrence revealed diverse treatment responses representing sensitive, intrinsic resistant, and acquired resistant subclones. Further characterization of tumor subclones and clustering analyses indicated that tumor heterogeneity under SOC treatments was linked to diverse biological mechanisms including neural development and oncogenic pathways, contributing to varying levels of subclonal resistance. Our analysis also highlighted intrinsic resistance was prominent as primary tumors often harbored substantial proportion of resistant tumor cells. This insight on resistant status at cell level then allowed us to compare resistant to sensitive cells and identify both established and potentially novel mechanisms of SOC resistance that were not always obvious in the comparison between primary and recurrence samples. These included activation of PI3K/AKT, MAPK, TGF-β, EMT, and WNT signaling pathways. Taken together, our novel analytical strategy revealed complex tumor heterogeneity and evolution landscape in SOC treated GBM, offering insights on potential mechanisms driving these phenomena and providing a resource for further exploration and development of therapeutic strategies.

 Although esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, there is little knowledge about its tumor heterogeneity affecting treatment response. To decipher transcriptomic heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME) from a therapeutic perspective, we conducted CITE-seq and immunostaining by Hyperion in ESCC with or without chemotherapeutic stimuli.
 Tumor biopsies of ESCC were sequentially collected by endoscopy from 3 patients during chemotherapy treatments. CITE-seq samples were processed with Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ Reagent Kit v2 (10 x Genomics) and TotalSeq Universal Cocktails (BioLegend) as per the manufacturer′s recommendations, respectively. Cell-to-cell interaction analyses in CITE-seq and neighborhood analyses in Hyperion were performed.
 Clinical responses of 3 patients for ESCC tumor biopsies were PD, SD, and PR, respectively. Cell annotation analyses in TME components revealed that populations of myeloid cells exhibited an overall decrease during the treatment across three patients, while the decrease in myeloid cell populations was more pronounced in the PR patient. The cluster analyses in epithelial cells exhibited 6 unique subclusters, which were transcriptionally characterized in proliferation, EMT, inflammation, and metabolic pathways. In spatial analyses, the epithelial cells in the PD patient adhered tightly to each other, while the epithelial cells in the SD or PR patient clustered relatively mixed with immune and stromal cells. In SD or PR patients, furthermore, varieties of T cell populations were more accumulated in response to the chemotherapy treatments compared to the PD patient. Neighborhood analysis and cell-cell interaction analysis together identified cell type pairs that showed consistent changes in physical and molecular perspectives. In PD patient, dendritic cell (DC)-macrophage pair was enriched in the proximity of each other, and also increased molecular interactions after chemotherapy. In contrast, activated T-Treg pair was depleted and decreased molecular interactions. Interestingly not just activated T-Treg interaction decreased, but proliferating T cells were also depleted from the tumor.
 We conducted integrative analyses with cutting-edge technologies to determine temporal dynamics of TME landscape in ESCC during chemotherapy treatment. Our observations may indicate that chemotherapy increased DC-macrophage interaction to suppress antigen presentation by DC, which suppressed T cell activation and proliferation. The mechanism might contribute to the chemotherapy resistance. These findings will shed light on the molecular insights to deeply understand complexity of the TME networks for chemotherapy resistance in ECSS.

 The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in ovarian cancer (OC) progression and prognosis, while also contributing to biological differences between primary and metastatic tumors. This study examines OC TMEs to uncover associations with clinical prognosis and tumor biology by analyzing paired primary and metastatic tumors from the same patients.



 This study focused on 57 stage-IIIC/IV OC patients treated at the Mayo Clinic, all of whom underwent surgical debulking and adjuvant therapies. All patients provided informed consent, and the study received IRB approval. A tissue microarray (TMA) was specifically designed and constructed, containing paired primary and metastatic tissue cores from the same patients. 147 tissue cores from the constructed TMA were profiled using a 35-antibody panel, with 17 antibodies for cell phenotyping and 18 for functional state characterization. Profiling was performed using Cell DIVE, a multiplexed imaging solution at the single-cell level developed by Leica Microsystems. After cell segmentations and classifications, detailed spatial niche and regional analyses were performed at the single-cell level. Immune cell populations, as well as their TME distributions, were characterized to conduct prognostic associations and contrast primary and metastasis differences.



 A total of 1,292,988 total cells (after excluding low-density signals and ambiguous classifications) were analyzed, with a median of 8,033 cells per core. Using spatial neighborhood analysis, 12 distinct spatial niches were identified with specific cell types and/or unique functional states. Among these, a macrophage- and fibroblast-enriched niche at the tumor-stroma interface was associated with improved overall survival (p=0.008). Another rare Treg-enriched niche, along with other immune cells, demonstrated protective effects, particularly in patients with residual macroscopic tumors after debulking surgery (p=0.05), while no significant effects were observed in those without visible residual disease (p=0.8). When comparing primary and metastatic tumors, metastatic lesions exhibited significantly increased tumor mass (p=2e-4) and a notable reduction in helper T cells (p=0.04) in tumor areas, as well as significantly increased fibroblast cells in tumor-stroma interfacing regions (p=0.002), reflecting distinct immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting shifts.



 This study reveals spatial and cellular differences in primary and metastatic OC TMEs, distribution differences linked to prognosis and surgical outcomes. These findings emphasize the potential of spatially resolved TME profiling to refine adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapeutic strategies.

 Pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma (PPC) is a rare and aggressive subtype of non-small cell lung cancer characterized by the presence of both epithelial and sarcomatoid components. We conducted multi-omics analyses on surgically resected specimens from nine primary PPC cases to explore characteristics of this tumor at molecular level.



 Whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing on bulk tumor specimens to identify mutational profiles. Spatial transcriptomics using the Digital Spatial Profiler was employed to analyze gene expression separately for epithelial and sarcomatoid tumor components. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was conducted on three cases to explore intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution. Gene signature based on extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling was developed and validated in public lung cancer datasets to assess its association with tumor aggressiveness and prognosis.



 Mutational analyses revealed MET exon 14 skipping in two cases and an ALK-EML4 fusion in one case, while no EGFR mutations were observed. We found various differential expressed genes (DEGs) between components. Further analysis (GSEA and Transcriptional factor scoring) revealed there was a common enrichment trend observed among pathways related to MYC, such as those involved in cell proliferation, division, and the cell cycle. On the other hand, significant differences were observed in pathways related to cancer invasion and cell-cell interactions, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and hypoxia. identified an atypical cell population bridging epithelial cells and fibroblasts, which we defined as sarcomatoid cells. The clusters defined as epithelial tumor cells and sarcomatoid cells showed upregulation of DEGs corresponding to the respective component identified through spatial transcriptomics. Trajectory analysis visualized tumor evolution, suggesting a transition from epithelial tumor cells to sarcomatoid cells. A consistent upregulation of seven ECM remodeling-related genes was observed in both tumor components compared to normal lung tissue. When applied to a GEO lung adenocarcinoma cohort, this gene signature was associated with more aggressive histological subtypes (P < 0.01). Survival analysis using TCGA demonstrated that high ECM remodeling signature scores correlated with significantly poorer prognosis (P < 0.01).



 This study provides a comprehensive molecular analysis of PPC, revealing both shared and distinct features between its components. The trajectory analysis supports the hypothesis of a common cellular origin for these components and highlights the transition to a more aggressive sarcomatoid phenotype. These findings provide new insights into the biology of PPC and identify potential therapeutic targets to address its intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution.

        <tr id="Purpose
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particularly aggressive subtype of breast cancer, with approximately 30% of patients eventually developing brain metastases (BM), which result in poor outcomes. An understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) at both primary and metastatic sites offers insights into the mechanisms underlying BM and potential therapeutic targets.


Materials and Method
Spatial RNA sequencing (spRNA-seq) was performed on primary TNBC and paired BM tissues from three patients, one of whom had previously received immune checkpoint inhibitors before BM diagnosis. Specimen regions were categorized into tumor, proximal, and distal TME based on their spatial locations. Gene expression differences across these zones were analyzed, and immune cell infiltration was estimated using TIMER. A gene module analysis was conducted to identify key gene clusters associated with BM.


Results
Distinct gene expression profiles were noted in the proximal and distal TMEs. In BM, the proximal TME exhibited neuronal gene expression, suggesting neuron-tumor interactions compared to tumor, and upregulation of epithelial genes compared to the distal TME. Immune cell analysis revealed dynamic changes in CD8+ T cells and macrophages across the tumor and TME zones. Gene module analysis identified five key modules, including one related to glycolysis, which correlated with patient survival. Drug repurposing analysis identified potential therapeutic targets, including VEGFA, RAC1, EGLN3, and CAMK1D.


Conclusion
This study provides novel insights into the transcriptional landscapes in TNBC BM using spRNA-seq, emphasizing the role of neuron-tumor interactions and immune dynamics. These findings suggest new therapeutic strategies and underscore the importance of further research.">

 Cholangiocarcinoma is an aggressive biliary adenocarcinoma with limited treatment options. Stromal infiltration and intratumoral heterogeneity in this tumor type prevents identification of actionable dependencies from bulk-tissue profiles. While cholangiocarcinoma illustrates these challenges, they are common across many other aggressive tumors.To address these challenges, we introduce a single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) framework for prioritization of drugs to treat heterogeneous tumor cell subpopulations. Single-cell analyses can bypass limitations of sample size in a precision medicine approach by providing large tumor cell “cohorts” even from individual patients, with the advantage that cell subpopulations can be effectively distinguished. Unfortunately, >80% of genes in each cell profiled by scRNA-Seq are typically undetectable, limiting discoverability of therapeutic targets and drug sensitivities. The VIPER algorithm addresses this by inferring the transcriptional activity of a protein from expression of its downstream target genes. By then identifying aberrantly activated proteins, each cell can be matched to an empiric database of cell line drug perturbation RNA-Seq, ranking drugs which empirically inhibit the proteins aberrantly activated in each cell. We refer to this approach as single-cell OncoTreat.Analysis of tumor cells across six patients by this approach has revealed three distinct sub-phenotypes of cholangiocarcinoma cells, with conserved proteomic signatures, and distinct predicted drug sensitivities. A seventh patient recapitulated these phenotypes, with drug predictions validated in a low-passage, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. The top-ranked drug by integrated analysis of all tumor cells was plicamycin, which at sub-cluster level only two of three clusters were predicted to respond to. Conversely, dacinostat was inferred to be active against all three tumor-cell sub-phenotypes. Tumor growth studies in PDX demonstrated growth rate control with both plicamycin and dacinostat, but much improved survival time with dacinostat, outperforming gemcitabine + cisplatin standard of care. Post-treatment scRNA-Seq confirmed predicted subpopulation-specific effects, such that dacinostat depleted all three tumor sub-phenotypes, while plicamycin depleted only the two predicted, allowing the third to reconstitute a treatment-resistant tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first report of dacinostat as an HDAC inhibitor effective in cholangiocarcinoma treatment, in vivo. Ultimately, this approach suggests promising candidates for follow-up trials in cholangiocarcinoma, and is highly generalizable to elucidate complementary dependencies of other aggressive, heterogeneous tumors.

 Understanding cellular behavior within the context of the tumor-immune microenvironment is essential to developing next-generation cancer therapies and advancing precision medicine. The inherent challenges of this problem reflect the complexity of human biology - patient and tissue heterogeneity, a multitude of interacting signaling pathways, dynamic short- and long-range interactions between the tumor and the immune system, and the intrinsic limitations of measurement techniques. Machine Learning foundation models trained on multimodal patient data present an opportunity to grapple with this complexity and push the field forward leveraging recent advances in spatial biology.



 A custom multimodal transformer was trained on 1399 primary resections from lung cancer patients profiled via H&E, CosMx spatial transcriptomics, whole-exome sequencing, and a custom multiplex immunofluorescence panel. To our knowledge this is the largest extant spatial transcriptomics dataset, comprising more than 40 million cells. The transformer was trained via self-supervised learning to predict expression of each CosMx panel gene for a single cell, conditioned on both spatially proximal and patient-level data from all modalities. This training task induces the model to learn fundamental rules that govern cell state and cell-cell interactions within the context of disease. The resulting model, Celleporter, can generate gene expression in a “virtual” cell at a particular location within real or simulated patient tissue. Counterfactual simulations with modified patient data can be used to predict the effects of genetic alterations, gene expression changes, or external interventions on the tumor-immune microenvironment.



 Celleporter accurately predicted spatial gene expression patterns from sparsely sampled data, resolving the limitations of traditional experimental approaches. Virtual cell simulations reproduced distinct biological states, such as cytotoxic and naïve transitions of CD8+ T cells within and outside tumor regions and reproduced foundational immunology, including the relationship between MHC-I and T cell activation. Comparative analyses across patient cohorts identified immune-suppressive mechanisms in STK11-mutant tumors resistant to immunotherapy. Perturbation simulations highlighted therapeutic targets predicted to restore cytotoxic activity in STK11-mutant tumor microenvironments.



 This study demonstrates that a self-supervised foundation model trained on large-scale multimodal patient data can learn fundamental aspects of cancer immunology, and accurately reproduce the impact of the tumor-immune microenvironment on cell state in a patient-specific manner. This flexible system for interrogating cell and tissue biology has direct application to patient stratification and target discovery.

        <tr id="Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy. Traditional clinical staging systems have limited value in prognostic evaluation and treatment guidance, often failing to capture the profound impact of intratumoral diversity on patient outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides new perspectives on the cellular makeup and conditions in tumor tissues, with promising implications for functional classification and personalized therapeutic strategies in esophageal cancer.In this study, we integrated scRNA-seq data with bulk RNA-seq profiles from esophageal cancer tissues to construct a comprehensive cellular atlas, focusing on the transcriptional characteristics of epithelial cells. Malignant epithelial cells were identified based on copy number variation (CNV) features using inferCNV analysis. Their developmental states and regulatory mechanisms were further characterized via transcription factor activity inference (SCENIC) and pseudotime trajectory analysis (Monocle). Based on marker genes of malignant epithelial subpopulations, we developed a multi-gene risk scoring model using data from the TCGA and GEO (GSE53624) cohorts. The model’s predictive value for immune landscape, mutational features, and drug sensitivity was also evaluated. Additionally, qRT-PCR was conducted to quantify the expression levels of model genes in ESCC tissue samples, further evaluating their biological relevance. Functional roles of the key gene HMGB3 were validated in vitro through CCK-8 proliferation assays, Transwell invasion assays, and colony formation assays following gene knockdown in ESCC cell lines.At the single-cell level, we identified ten major cell types and six distinct malignant epithelial subclusters, which exhibited pronounced heterogeneity in cell cycle states, transcriptional regulatory networks, and differentiation trajectories. High CNV scores and the enrichment of specific transcription factors (e.g., FOXC1, E2F1, RUNX1) suggested a proliferative and immune-evasive phenotype. A six-gene prognostic model (HMGB3, CHORDC1, CTSD, BTG2, MT1E, PHYHD1) showed strong predictive accuracy for overall survival in the TCGA and GSE53624 cohorts. Furthermore, the risk score showed a significant correlation with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, increased tumor purity, and the activation of certain immune-related pathways. Analysis of drug sensitivity suggests that patients classified as low-risk could respond better to various targeted therapies and chemotherapeutic agents, underscoring their potential clinical relevance. Functional assays revealed that HMGB3 knockdown markedly suppressed ESCC cell proliferation, invasion, and colony formation, supporting its oncogenic role in esophageal cancer progression.This study systematically characterized epithelial cell heterogeneity in esophageal cancer at single-cell resolution and established a risk model based on malignant epithelial markers that effectively predicts prognosis, immune status, and potential drug response. Combined with experimental validation, our findings highlight the pivotal role of HMGB3 in ESCC progression and provide a novel theoretical and practical framework for functional tumor classification and individualized treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="End stage breast cancer often presents with oligometastatic tumors and lacks effective treatment options. Previous studies leveraged post-mortem tissue procurement (also called rapid autopsy) programs to collect tumors shortly after death for profiling by bulk whole exome sequencing (WES). This has revealed substantial heterogeneity in the genomes of metastatic estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and triple-negative breast cancers. In order to understand the heterogeneity of both the genotypes, transcriptional phenotypes, and evolution of these tumors, we collected multi-site metastatic tumors from two end-stage ER+ breast cancer patients enrolled in the LEGACY rapid post-mortem tissue procurement trial. Metastatic tumors were profiled using WES and single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). We reconstructed high resolution phylogenies for each patient using the mutation called from the snRNA-seq reads to determine the subclonal architecture of cancer cells. Based on the mutation patterns, the gene expression profiles, and the subclonal architecture, we found that the tumors in each patient were divided into two distinct subtypes. A majority of the tumors were grouped into a subtype characterized by a high intra-tumor heterogeneity, with many cell lineages shared widely across metastasis, indicating extensive and undirected dissemination. The cancer cells of this subtype exhibited an EMT gene expression signature. In contrast, the second tumor subtype observed was rare and demonstrated little intra-tumor heterogeneity, a proliferative gene expression signature, and an interferon response signature present widely across cells in the microenvironment. Across all tumors, macrophages comprised the majority of the immune cells. Low diversity tumor macrophages exhibited strong activation of multiple interferon signaling pathways compared to high diversity tumor macrophages. Interestingly, these macrophages expressed a mixture of M1 and M2 polarization markers as STAT1, SOCS1, ISG15, ISG20, MX1, MX2, OAS1, OAS3 that did not correspond to classical M1 or M2 polarization states. This contrast demonstrates that multi-site metastatic tumors and their microenvironment adopt dichotomous states, which may contribute to the difficulties in treating progressive disease. It also underscores the need for a comprehensive and personalized late-stage therapeutic strategy to target the diversity of existing tumor phenotypes.

 Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) represents an alternative vascularization mechanism contributing to cancer progression and treatment resistance. Despite its clinical significance, the spatial and molecular relationships between VM networks and immune components remain poorly characterized in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
 Methods: We conducted a comprehensive spatial analysis of treatment-naïve, surgically resectable advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens (n=4), encompassing both EGFR-mutant and wild-type variants. High-dimensional spatial phenotyping was performed using PhenoCycler-Fusion multiplexed immunofluorescence technology, enabling precise visualization and quantification of vasculogenic mimicry (VM) architectures and immune cell infiltrates at subcellular resolution. Complementary molecular characterization of discrete tumor microenvironmental regions was achieved through GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling platform. Spatial transcriptomics analysis was subsequently employed to validate primary observations and elucidate region-specific transcriptional signatures.
 Results: Through high-dimensional spatial analysis, we identified a previously undescribed vessel-like population characterized by CD31-VEGFR1+PanCK+ expression, representing vasculogenic mimicry (VM) structures in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Comprehensive spatial mapping revealed distinct topographical relationships between VM networks and immune cell populations, including CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, as well as functionally diverse macrophage subsets (CD68+, CD206+, iNOS+, and HLA-DR+). Molecular characterization through digital spatial profiling demonstrated enhanced transcriptional heterogeneity at the tumor margin, with significant enrichment of pathways involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and hypoxia response (FDR < 0.01). Integration of spatial transcriptomics with an established 70-gene VM signature revealed a core set of 10 genes operating at the intersection of VM and ECM remodeling programs. This gene module, predominantly expressed at the tumor-stromal interface, represents a previously unrecognized regulatory hub coordinating VM formation through ECM modification.
 Conclusions: Our integrated analysis reveals a novel VM phenotype in NSCLC and identifies a core gene signature linking VM formation to ECM remodeling at the invasive front. These findings provide new insights into tumor-stromal-immune interactions and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting the VM-ECM-immune axis.

 MOSAIC (Multi-Omics Spatial Atlas in Cancer) is a multicenter clinical omics study aimed at deciphering cancer biology. We systematically profile thousands of cancer samples, focusing on spatial transcriptomics and single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) data across multiple tumor types.Here, we present the MOSAIC Window initiative, our first open science dataset. This multi-omics dataset can be leveraged to explore tumor heterogeneity and biomarker discovery within the tumor microenvironment (TME).



 The MOSAIC Window dataset includes 60 samples from patients with Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (n = 15), Ovarian cancer (n = 15), Diffuse-large B-cell Lymphoma, Mesothelioma and Glioblastoma (n = 10 each).Each sample underwent Visium spatial transcriptomics, Chromium Flex snRNAseq, bulk RNAseq, whole-exome sequencing, and hematoxylin-eosin histology scans. We collected extensive clinical information, including age; gender; BMI; risk factors; cancer treatments; clinical, pathological and molecular information; and progression-free and overall survival.We applied strict quality control metrics in each data modality which we are reporting. Tumor heterogeneity was measured using snRNAseq and spatial transcriptomics integration. First, scANVI method was used on snRNAseq data to identify and annotate sub-populations cells from the TME. For cancer cell population, shared nearest neighbour (SNN) modularity optimization based clustering algorithm was used to separate clusters of cancer cell sub-populations. Differential expression analysis was used between these sub-populations to generate references. Then, cell type deconvolution was performed using cell2location and the references generated from snRNAseq data.



 The analysis of the spatial distribution of sub-population of cancer cells revealed distinct sub-populations of cancer cells, corresponding to different molecular sub-clones and/or TME cell composition (niches). Our computational approach highlighted significant variability in intra-tumoral heterogeneity across cancer types and patients. Samples ranged from having a single homogeneous niche to multiple distinct niches, each characterized by specific malignant cell subtypes and their associated TME, highlighting the interplay between these two compartments, which we are detailing and quantifying. These results provide important insights into potential mechanisms of treatment resistance, biomarker discovery, patient subgroup identification, and potential combination treatment strategies.



 The open science MOSAIC Window dataset demonstrates how integrating spatial and single-nuclei data provides key insights understanding of intra- and inter-patient tumor heterogeneity, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies. Data is accessible on demand on EGA.

 High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor treatment outcomes. Although transformative for some cancer types, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been only marginally successful at best in HGSC. Comprehensive interrogation of the cellular and molecular features of the tumor and immune microenvironment (TIME) of HGSC cases with varying responses to ICI could provide novel insights into the potential drivers of therapeutic response.



 We applied 10x Genomics Visium Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) to archival tissue sections from 10 patients treated with ICI (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) with varying degrees of response. Integrated cluster analysis of 39,147 ST features using Louvain optimization resulted in 20 integrated clusters. Molecular annotation using GSEA, ESTIMATE, and CIBERSORTx was performed on individual clusters to assess spatially resolved cellular transcriptional states within the cohort and by ICI response.



 Bioinformatics analysis of marker gene data from each group (responder or non-responder) provided insights into cell types for each cluster defined by transcriptional states. Major cell type populations by cluster included tumor, immune, fibroblast, epithelial, and smooth muscle. Cluster 1 cell type of both responders and non-responders is molecularly defined by known HGSC genes including CD24, WFDC2, SLPI, and MUC1. Non-responders also expressed CRIP1 and ELF3, which are associated with metastasis and cancer cell stemness, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis across the entire cohort identified distinct immune-related pathways, including allograft rejection, IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling and interferon responses, corroborating the immune cell deconvolution findings from CIBERSORTx. Interestingly, clusters 6 and 8 for both groups seem to represent a specialized population of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs), marked by expression of LYZ, APOE, APOC1, GPNMB. However, in responders, we observed upregulation of antigen presenting genes, including LYZ, C1QA, C1QC, CD74, and CXCR4. In contrast, non-responders had high expression of immunosuppressive macrophages including MMP9 and IFI30 within the LAM compartment. Non-responders demonstrated higher immune composition scores in several clusters, predominantly for M0 and M2 macrophages, which are associated with immunosuppressive phenotypes. In contrast, responders displayed a more immune-activated profile, with increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells, activated CD4+ memory T cells, and activated NK cells. Notably, M2 macrophages were more abundant in the tumor cluster of non-responders, indicating a more immunosuppressive TME.



 These results underscore the heterogeneity within the tumor and immune microenvironments in HGSC tumors that may uncover novel markers or targets of response to ICI.

 Glioblastoma (GBM) remains an untreatable disease. Understanding of GBM’s infiltrative biology at the resection margin is limited, despite causing disease recurrence and progression. To address this, we generated a high-throughput single-nucleus (sn)RNA-seq and snATAC-seq multi-omic dataset from six tumors with distinct genomic drivers and combined it with spatial transcriptomics to characterize the unique molecular phenotype of GBM near the margin. By contrasting GBM-specific biology in matching “Core” vs. “Margin” dissections, we define unique, shared “GBM infiltration” and chromatin accessibility signatures near the margin. We prioritize EGFR as a top differentially expressed and accessible “Margin” marker across GBM subtypes, show its dynamic expression along a core-to-margin infiltration trajectory, and validate its role in migration through CRISPR/Cas9 deletion in two patient-derived models. ChIP-seq studies further corroborate preferential TEAD1 binding at EGFR’s accessible regulatory elements. This validated multi-omic dataset enables further studies into tumor and microenvironment biology in the context of residual GBM disease.

 Background:
 Colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most prevalent cancer globally, remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality. Genomic and epigenomic plasticity during CRC progression, particularly metastasis, poses significant challenges to effective treatment. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) reflect the heterogeneous genetic and morphological composition of cancer cells, enabling ex vivo disease modeling. This study investigates the epigenomic makeup of human primary and metastatic CRC to advance precision epigenetic therapies.
 Methods:
 We analyzed 45 organoid models, including 40 CRC organoids (from primary tumors and liver/lung metastases) and 5 generated from healthy colonic tissue. Using integrative epigenomic profiling, including chromatin accessibility, chromatin state mapping (via six histone modifications), and 3D genome conformation, we constructed a comprehensive CRC epigenomic landscape.
 Results:
 Our analysis of CRC patient-derived organoids revealed a core set of accessible genomic regions shared across all organoids, irrespective of tumor location or metastatic status. This conserved chromatin signature highlights common regulatory pathways in CRC during disease progression. Unsupervised clustering based on epigenomic features revealed four distinct CRC subtypes, encompassing both primary and metastatic models. Notably, organoids derived from liver and lung metastases did not cluster by metastatic site, underscoring epigenomic convergence. Subtype D comprised 57.1% (8/14) of primary tumors, while subtypes B and C contained 47.3% (9/19) of liver metastases and 42.8% (3/7) of lung metastases, respectively. KRAS mutation status further stratified subtypes, with wild-type KRAS observed exclusively in subtypes A and B, while KRAS-mutant variants were enriched in subtypes C (6/7) and D (4/10). Histone modification patterns, defined by six marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, H3K36me3, and H3K9me3) revealed subtype-specific regulatory chromatin landscapes. Three-dimensional chromatin interactions were mapped, and genome-wide interaction contacts are used to identify various chromatin structures that may influence metastatic capacity.
 Conclusions:
 This study highlights distinct and shared epigenomic signatures in CRC PDOs, offering novel insights into tumor progression and metastasis. Integrative chromatin analysis provides a framework for identifying epigenetic biomarkers and epigenome targeting strategies.

        <tr id="Biological systems exhibit remarkable heterogeneity, characterized by intricate interplay among diverse cell types. Resolving the regulatory processes of specific cell types is crucial for delineating developmental mechanisms and disease etiologies. While single-cell sequencing methods such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq have revolutionized our understanding of individual cellular functions, adapting bulk genome-wide assays to achieve single-cell resolution of other genomic features remains a significant technical challenge. Here, we introduce Deep-learning-based DEconvolution of Tissue profiles with Accurate Interpretation of Locus-specific Signals (DeepDETAILS), a novel quasi-supervised framework to reconstruct cell-type-specific genomic signals with base-pair precision. DeepDETAILS’ core innovation lies in its ability to perform cross-modality deconvolution using scATAC-seq reference libraries for other bulk datasets, benefiting from the affordability and availability of scATAC-seq data. DeepDETAILS enables high-resolution mapping of genomic signals across diverse cell types, with great versatility for various omics datasets, including nascent transcript sequencing (such as PRO-cap and PRO-seq) and ChIP-seq for chromatin modifications. Our results demonstrate that DeepDETAILS significantly outperformed traditional statistical deconvolution methods. Using DeepDETAILS, we developed a comprehensive compendium of high-resolution nascent transcription and histone modification signals across 39 diverse human tissues and 86 distinct cell types. Furthermore, we applied our compendium to fine-map risk variants associated with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a progressive cholestatic liver disorder, and revealed a potential etiology of the disease. Our tool and compendium provide invaluable insights into cellular complexity, opening new avenues for studying biological processes in various contexts.">

 Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) offer new opportunities to model various cancers. However, their application in prostate cancer (PCa) has been hampered by poor success rates and overgrowth of cell types which are not representative of the patient samples. Here, we aimed at modulating culture conditions and investigating in vitro-associated cellular heterogeneity to identify refined PCa PDO culture conditions.



 A cohort of 164 diverse samples was obtained from 162 PCa patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, prostatic biopsies, transurethral resection of the prostate or the bladder or metastasis biopsy/resection. Out of this cohort, PDOs were established in various extracellular matrices (ECM: Matrigel, Collagen I, Collagen IV, Laminin-I, or no ECM) and medium compositions. PDOs were characterized using IF, IHC, and FISH. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on 11 tumor and organoid samples, followed by unsupervised clustering, trajectory inferring, cell type annotation, and CNV analysis. Published spatial and bulk transcriptomic data were re-analyzed to validate specific markers. A prostate PDO scRNA-seq atlas was generated by integrating three published PDO datasets (Huang 2023, Song 2022, McCray 2019) together with our newly-generated data.



 Out of 5 ECM conditions, an ECM-free culture system increased the take-rate of PDOs with luminal-like (CK5-, CK8+, AR+) and PCa features (AMACR+, PTEN-), while standard Matrigel-based culture conditions yielded basal-like benign organoids (CK5+, AR-, AMACR-). Cellular composition of organoids generated in ECM-free conditions differed significantly from those generated in Matrigel, with minimal overlap observed in their transcriptomic profiles. ECM-free PDOs comprised cell populations associated with known PCa signatures, exhibited transcriptomic resemblance with their respective parental tumors, and maintained patient-specific epithelial populations. Furthermore, we defined organoid cell type signatures and identified markers discriminating between several types of benign cells (basal, hillock, club, transitioning) versus tumor cell populations ex vivo and in situ. Finally, our integrative single-cell atlas highlighted that Matrigel-based organoids derived from primary PCa are essentially composed of benign epithelial cells, irrespective of the dataset or the malignant nature of the tissue of origin. In contrast, ECM-free conditions preserved heterogenous tumor-like cell populations with higher inferred copy-number variations and were enriched in intermediate club-like cell populations.



 ECM-free PCa PDOs exhibit improved fidelity and in vitro-enriched cell populations, while aberrant benign lineage programs are associated with Matrigel culture. Our work contributes to significantly enhancing the potential of PDOs in PCa research.

 Glioblastoma or GBM is an aggressive brain cancer with a 5 year survival rate below 10 percent. Glioma stem cells or GSCs drive GBM formation, growth, and resistance. Previously, analysis of 17,601 phase contrast images from 15 GBM patients revealed that neurodevelopmental GSCs form smaller, uniform clusters, while mesenchymal and injury-response GSCs exhibit complex, irregular growth patterns. This new study examines the spatial distribution and local cellular niche of GSCs along a neurodevelopmental gradient in primary GBM. We develop a geospatial map of GSCs in relation to other cell-types, identifying community patterns of organization.



 We profiled 14 primary, treatment-naive GBM tissue sections (5 micrometer thick) on a spatial transcriptomics platform (Xenium), utilizing a custom 414 gene panel to score the GSC, GBM and other cell signatures. We segmented cell boundaries using both Baysor and Proseg algorithms and performed hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of tissue sections post-Xenium run. We performed spatial clustering using SpaGCN and Banksy, followed by spatial distribution and spatial point pattern analysis (Ripley’s, Moran’s I).



 Across the 14 tissues, we segmented 5, 705, 825 cells and annotated each cell with a cell-type label using pre-defined gene sets. This resulted in 15.2 percent GSC-like cells, 9.0% oligodendrocytic-OPC-like, 8.7% astrocytic-mesenchymal-like, 6.7% neuronal-like, 15.0% immune, 7.1% endothelial, and the rest of the cells showing mixed signatures. In total we identified 110-140 spatial clusters, which we classified into 8 domains by grouping highly correlated spatial clusters using Pearson correlation.
 All cell-types were differentially distributed both proportionally and spatially. Domains with highly correlated grouped clusters exhibited distinct spatial arrangements of cells as well. For instance, GSC-like cells were confined to unique spatial domains with specific geometric properties across cellular hierarchies. Likewise, immune and endothelial cells displayed enrichment in preferred domains, with some co-localized with GSC-enriched regions while others were devoid of these cell types. Therefore, we find that these geospatial topology maps could identify spatial enrichment patterns and distributional trends.



 This study deciphers GBM’s geospatial topology, where annotated cell-types are mapped to specific niches. Though the ultimate aim of the study will be to eliminate GSC-like cells in GBM, we posit that by revealing cell community patterns, we aim to shift therapeutic strategies from targeting single cells or molecules to biomarkers that address entire cell communities within which these GSCs are spatially and functionally connected to. This framework lays the groundwork for future biomarker discovery and therapeutic interventions in GBM.

 Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies have markedly improved the prognosis for patients with stage III & IV metastatic melanoma by prolonging progression-free and overall survival rates. However, the variability in immune evasion and resistance mechanisms presents significant challenges to the clinical efficacy of ICIs. This project aims to define drivers of immunotherapy response and resistance by employing advanced genomic, single-cell mRNA analyses, and spatial profiling techniques on tissue biopsies from metastatic melanoma patients.



 In this study, we developed a framework to analyze response and resistance, both intrinsic and acquired, via immune features in the tumor microenvironment in a standardized, uniformly processed, and deeply clinically annotated cohort of metastatic melanoma patients (n=61) treated with ICB as part of the human tumor atlas network (HTAN) initiative. From the tumor samples, we conducted single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and for a subset of the samples high-resolution spatial imaging (including protein mIHC, CODEX, and transcriptomics MERFISH). Standardized processing and data pipelines allowed for integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and spatial features to elucidate characteristics and mechanisms in tumor microenvironment and their relationships with resistance.



 Studies of the pretreatment samples demonstrated that CD4 and CD8 T cells, particularly TCF7+ CD8 T cells, are significantly more prevalent in responders to immunotherapy. Conversely, macrophages, especially Angio-TAMs, show higher levels of enrichment in non-responders. Moreover, the presence of B cells and follicular dendritic cells in non-lymph node biopsies supports the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures within the TME. Three levels of immune enrichment were identified through spatial analysis, and samples with more immune enrichment tend to have better responses. We also identified 10 recurrent cellular neighborhoods (RCNs) and found that RCN2,4, and 7 with high lymphocyte infiltration are significantly more enriched in responders than non-responders. In addition, RCN4 is associated with immune infiltration while RCN7 is TLS-like.



 Our findings indicate that patients with low immune infiltration exhibited enrichment of macrophages associated with the hypoxia and angiogenesis phenotypes, while patients with high immune infiltrates displayed enrichment in lymphocytes, particularly TCF7+ CD8+ T cells, confirming previous findings and indicating a robust T cell-mediated immune response. This project integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and spatial features to elucidate shared tumor and microenvironmental states and their relationships with resistance, and guide more personalized and effective treatment strategies for metastatic melanoma.

 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is the cellular environment in which cancer cell exist and is made up of a combination of stroma cells and extra cellular matrix (ECM), secreted biomolecules, including cytokines, from both stroma cells and tumor cells. The TME composition drives tumor growth and drug resistance. We previously established a 96-wells based bioprinted glioblastoma (GBM) model that includes a neurovascular unit (NVU) made up of endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. We demonstrated its applicability for drug screening by using high content imaging system to measure tumor size and vascular integrity. We then performed single cell RNA sequencing on this bioprinted NVU-GBM model. We used the single cell transcriptomics data to investigate ligand-receptor interactions between stroma and GBM cells, to find molecular pathways that potentially drive tumor growth and be targets for pharmacological intervention as anticancer drugs. We identified 50 ligand-receptors pairs and selected those with genes exclusively expressed in GBM cells but not in the stroma cells, to minimize potential toxic effects of drugs to the non-cancer cells. We performed a drug screen of 34 compounds targeting many of these receptors on the GBM cells, and identified 15 compounds that reduced GBM cells growth, with minimal effects on vascular integrity. This result demonstrates a promising pharmacogenomics approach to using bioengineered tumor growth tissue models that include the TME, integrated with single cell transcriptomics, to find actionable pharmacological targets that inhibit tumor growth without affecting the stroma cells.

 Background:
 Follicular lymphoma (FL) exhibits considerable variability in biological features and clinical trajectories, compounded by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) populated with nonmalignant immune cells. In this study, we comprehensively characterized FL by integrating multi-omics data that considered both tumor cells and microenvironmental components. This analysis revealed four subtypes of FL, each exhibiting distinct biological characteristics and differing clinical behaviors.
 Methods:
 Our study included 1,203 samples, 53 bulk transcriptomic samples from our center, 1,150 samples from public databases, and five single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) cohorts. The Ecotyper algorithm was employed to identify immune cell states. Unsupervised clustering analysis using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was performed to identify distinct FL subtypes based on cellular infiltration.
 Results:
 A total of 30 unique cell states were identified from nine annotated cell populations (B cells, plasma cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, Tregs, NK cells, Tfh, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells). Validation was performed across three independent scRNA-seq and bulk transcriptomic cohorts to ensure robustness. Four distinct B cell states were identified, each exhibiting unique gene expression profiles and varying prognostic implications. B cell S2 and S3 were associated with adverse outcomes. Notably, PRDM15 in B cell S2 had the most significant prognostic impact, remaining an independent adverse prognostic factor even after adjustment for m7-FLIPI. Mutational profile analysis demonstrated distinct mutation patterns across B cell states: mutations in CCND3, SPEN, and ARID1A were enriched in B cell S1; CREBBP and STAT6 mutations were prominent in B cell S2; and IRF8 and BCL2 mutations were observed in B cell S4, while no significant mutation enrichment was detected in B cell S3. Similarly, immune cells of the same type yet in different states exhibited functional and clinical heterogeneity. Four subtypes of follicular lymphoma characterized by distinct tumor cell states and varying immune infiltration were identified through unsupervised clustering analysis. FLE1 exhibits characteristics of a "cold tumor" with a high abundance of B cell S2. In contrast, FLE2 and FLE3 show moderate immune infiltration, while FLE4 is marked by abundant immune infiltration and elevated expression of immunosuppressive checkpoint molecules, resembling an "inflammatory" tumor phenotype. Prognostic analysis indicates that FLE1 has the most unfavorable prognosis, followed by FLE4.
 Conclusions:
 Our study stratifies FL patients based on the heterogeneity of tumor cells and the immune microenvironment, proposing an immune-based classification for FL. Targeting CREBBP and PRDM15 may offer promising new strategies for the clinical management of patients exhibiting a "cold tumor" phenotype.

 The development of metastatic disease is a conserved feature across most solid organ malignancies and accounts for the majority of cancer-related deaths. While adaptations within the local immune microenvironment of primary tumors are well-appreciated hallmarks of tumor progression, there remains much unknown about the specific impact of metastasis on both local and systemic immune responses. Here, we present an analysis of changes in the adaptive immune response to tumors during metastasis and clonal selection. Our group previously developed a syngeneic melanoma mouse model of spontaneous lymph node metastasis, performing nine generations of in vivo serial passaging to select for metastatic phenotypes. As previous work suggests, we find that tumors undergo clonal selection during metastasis using lentivirus integration mapping to measure clonality. Even amidst reduced genomic diversity, we find that metastases exhibit comparable or increased transcriptomic diversity when compared to primary tumors. In light of this discordance between genomic and transcriptomic diversity, we ask whether the immune response, especially T cells, exhibit similar dynamics. Performing both bulk and single cell T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, we find that T cell clonality mirrors the reduced clonal diversity of metastatic tumors both in the total T cell compartment and specifically in regulatory T cells. Through paired investigation of evolution of tumors and the responding immune cells, we develop a model of tumor-immune coevolution in which reduced tumor clonality selects for narrower T cell repertoires; yet, diverse tumor transcriptional profiles support the differentiation of a variety of T cell subsets that are advantageous for tumors including regulatory T cells and exhausted CD8+ T cells. We further perturb this dynamic by evolving new metastatic cell lines in the absence of T cell pressure, finding unique evolution of metastatic pathways when the immune system is altered, impairing metastasis when reimplanted into immunocompetent mice. This model of tumor-immune coevolution establishes the importance of ongoing, dynamic communication between the host and tumors throughout metastatic progression.

 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is known to be an essential component in the response to multiple therapeutics, including immunotherapies. The TME is comprised of the tumor itself, infiltrating immune cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM has been shown to play a critical role in tumorigenesis, affect the efficacy of certain treatments, and regulate anti-tumor immunity. However, methods to study ECM have typically been limited to single-marker studies or have used dissociated methods which lose spatial context. Additionally, fluorescence-based approaches to study the ECM are challenging due to the auto-fluorescence properties of multiple ECM components. We chose to utilize the multiplex capabilities of Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) for its ability to detect up to 40 different proteins via metal-tagging and absence of auto-fluorescence. We selected and validated 40 markers which we believe play an integral role in ECM, including structural proteins as well as immune markers and metabolic enzymes. This 40-plex panel was validated using a tissue microarray (TMA) comprised of various healthy and diseased tissue samples such as Lung, Colon, Breast, Prostate, Kidney, and Liver and their respective tumor counterparts. After staining, our results underwent rigorous analysis through a multi-step image comparison of our staining results to those in the current literature, ensuring our staining was specific. We found significant differences in the protein expression of various ECM markers between the healthy tissue and their tumor counterpart. We found structural variations of multiple ECM proteins between the normal tissue and tumor tissue. However, the expression patterns of these ECM elements were not uniform between tumor types, with overexpression of HAPLN1 in breast cancer while decreased in colon cancer. The included immune markers allow for spatial studies to examine the role of ECM in regulating immune responses, such as CD8+ T-cell infiltration. Additionally, we found that tumors from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients exhibit significant ECM heterogeneity. We used a patch-based analysis approach to examine the ECM phenotypes of a cohort of 35 NSCLC patients. Preliminary assessment demonstrates unique clusters of ECM phenotypes have a utility for predicting patient outcomes. Further analysis of this cohort will be presented. Overall, we present a highly-multiplexed IMC panel which allows for detailed assessment of the ECM.

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), defined by a lack of hormone receptors and lack of HER2 amplification, is the deadliest subtype of breast cancer. TNBC kills 1 in 3 patients and while promising new drugs based on PARP inhibition and anti-PD1 immunotherapy can extend survival in selected patients, 30-40% of patients relapse or fail therapy. Increasing evidence suggests that TNBC tumors harbor stem-like tumorigenic cancer cells with high plasticity, capable of replenishing cancer cell populations and linked to adverse outcomes. Unfortunately, the phenotypic diversity, microenvironmental contexture, and functional significance of these cells remain poorly understood and available marker genes are not specific, precluding rational drug development.



 We created a multimodal single-cell RNA-seq atlas of 80 TNBC patients, including clinical covariates such as BRCA1/2 mutations, race/ethnicity, and prior treatment status. We then defined differentiation-associated malignant cell states using a novel interpretable deep learning approach for determining single-cell potency. We subsequently interrogated geospatial features, including localized microenvironments of less differentiated malignant cells, and linked them to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response.



 Our quantitative analysis shows that TNBC is enriched in cancer cells with high developmental potency as compared to other breast cancer subtypes, consistent with its aggressive phenotype. Critically, we observed a strong association between enrichment of high potency cells and resistance to ICI treatment across human and mouse bulk expression data, both within TNBC and across other cancer types, a finding that we experimentally validated in a murine model of TNBC. In scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data, we defined striking relationships between less differentiated cancer cells and context-dependent T cell states indicative of strong immunosuppressive capability. In line with this, we found that knockout of genes associated with immature cancer cells promotes TNBC cell killing by T cells in a co-culture CRISPR screen. Ongoing experiments include perturbations of novel therapeutic targets emerging from this work, with the goal of improving immunotherapy responses and ultimately extending patient survival.



 We anticipate that our approach will expand our understanding of developmental landscapes in TNBC and lead to new opportunities for developing targeted drugs in this devastating disease.

        <tr id="Accumulating research suggests that Epstein-Barr Virus-positive Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (EBV+DLBCL) is associated with immune dysfunction and tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity. While the prognostic role of the TME in EBV-DLBCL is established, its impact on EBV+DLBCL survival remains unclear. Here, we integrated 10X Visium spatial transcriptomics (ST) with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map TME heterogeneity in EBV+DLBCL. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses identified PD-1/PD-L1 signaling as a hallmark of EBV+DLBCL’s immunosuppressive TME. Functional validation using the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor BMS202 revealed dose-dependent suppression of proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in EBV+Farage cells, with TLR4 emerging as a downstream effector showing EBV-status-dependent regulation. These findings not only link TME-driven PD-1/PD-L1 activation to EBV+DLBCL’s poor prognosis but also provide preclinical evidence for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade as a therapeutic strategy.

        <tr id="Purpose Bladder cancer (BC) is characterized by high heterogeneity, with non-muscle-invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive (MIBC) stages differing significantly in clinical behavior and outcomes. The transition from NMIBC to MIBC involves extensive tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling, particularly in endothelial cells (ECs), which drive angiogenesis and modulate immune and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. However, the precise roles of ECs in this progression remain poorly defined. Methods Public single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from 47 BC patients were analyzed to characterize endothelial cell heterogeneity and functional states across NMIBC and MIBC. Computational tools such as CellChat were applied to reconstruct cell–cell communication networks, focusing on pathways related to angiogenesis, immune crosstalk, and ECM remodeling. Results Twelve major cell types were identified, with endothelial cells exhibiting distinct transcriptional profiles between NMIBC and MIBC. NMIBC-associated ECs promoted adhesion and migration through HMGB1 and CXCL12 signaling. In contrast, MIBC was enriched in an ADAM10+ endothelial subset associated with vascular remodeling and activation of Wnt signaling via CTNNB1. Key ligand-receptor interactions highlighted the dynamic roles of ECs in TME modulation during BC progression. Conclusions This study reveals stage-specific endothelial cell phenotypes and signaling networks in BC. The identification of an MIBC-specific ADAM10+ endothelial subset underscores its potential role in driving tumor progression and highlights opportunities for stage-adapted vascular-targeted therapies. These findings advance our understanding of BC pathogenesis and provide the foundation for novel therapeutic strategies.

 Deciphering the changes in the tumor and tumor microenvironment (TME) that accompany metastatic disease progression is essential if we are to identify potential new anti-cancer treatments. In particular, a complete understanding of how cancer subclones and TME evolve over time from primary disease to death, both independently and in relation to one another, and of the impact of therapies such as immunotherapy (IO) on TME composition and architecture, remain lacking. In this work, we sought to profile the changes in both cancer-cell intrinsic genomic immune evasion and TME that accompany lung cancer progression from diagnosis to death. To do this, we applied multiple orthogonal methods (whole-exome sequencing; RNAseq; imaging mass cytometry) to >500 longitudinally collected primary, pre-mortem metastatic, and postmortem metastatic tumor samples from 23 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) co-recruited to the UK national TRACERx (TRAcking Cancer Evolution through therapy [Rx], NCT01888601) and PEACE (Posthumous Evaluation of Advanced Cancer Environment) autopsy studies. Samples covered multiple organ sites and were derived from both patients who did and did not receive IO, allowing analysis of the differential impact of treatment on end-stage disease profiles. Sequencing analyses suggest that heterogeneous mechanisms of immune evasion develop at distinct metastatic sites, and between metastases and the primary tumor. Profiling of TME indicated a global reduction in immune cell densities in metastatic compared to primary tumor samples and a skewing towards cytotoxic and terminally differentiated CD8 T cell subtypes. Previous work had identified four major TME architectures in primary NSCLC, based on the abundance and location of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, including a neutrophil-rich TME found to be associated with metastasis. In this work, we identified new TME classes found in metastatic samples, including those dominated by myeloid cells in the stroma. Two new TME classes, predominantly comprised of post-mortem metastatic samples from IO-treated patients, were significantly enriched in tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic CD8 T cells compared to other classes. TMEs of regions within the same metastasis were found to be more similar to each other than to those of primary tumor regions. Using computational approaches to track cancer subclones, we reconstructed metastatic migration histories for each patient and found that the TMEs of source and target metastases in a met-met migration pair were more similar than those from pairs of metastases from the same patient without a direct migration path. Our findings provide insights into the relationships between genetic immune evasion and immune cell infiltration across the lung cancer disease course.

 Metastatic bladder cancer (BLCA) is an aggressive disease complicated by the emergence of variant histological subtypes and variable responses to treatment. Understanding the heterogeneity that exists both between these histological subtypes and within individual BLCA tumors is imperative in advancing precision medicine for BLCA.



 The University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center metastatic BLCA rapid autopsy program is a first-of-its-kind program collecting both primary and metastatic tumor samples from advanced BLCA patients, with a focus on aggressive variant subtype tumors. To explore intra-tumoral heterogeneity of both tumor and stromal compartments, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, in combination with matching bulk DNA and RNA sequencing, was performed on 15 tumors from 9 patients. The resulting dataset totaled 39,888 cells across a variety of histological subtypes: conventional urothelial carcinoma (UC), UC with squamous differentiation (UCSD), and plasmacytoid UC (PUC).



 Our unique snRNAseq dataset, the first in either metastatic or variant subtype BLCA, was used to dissect genomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity within BLCA tumors. On a genomic level, we observe subclonal copy number variations (CNVs) in BLCA driver genes in almost all (8/9) patients. Furthermore, we observe varying levels of intra-tumoral transcriptomic heterogeneity, where metastatic survival time is positively associated with tumor heterogeneity. Despite this heterogeneity, particular pathways define the epithelial transcriptomics of variant histological subtypes, including the upregulation of cell cycle and DNA repair upregulated in PUC tumors, which is validated in both bulk RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry of a larger UW/FH BLCA rapid autopsy cohort. Investigation of the tumor microenvironment revealed that PUC tumors may be more immune-hot than UC, with increased B- and T-cell infiltration, while UCSD tumors have immunosuppressive microenvironments enriched in tissue-associated macrophages. Interestingly, these differences across subtypes are supported by changes in inter-cellular signaling between epithelial and fibroblast cells and the immune cells.



 These findings lay the groundwork for development of precision medicines for histological subtypes in BLCA by revealing heterogeneity and immune microenvironments that underlie disease aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance.

 Prostate cancer (PCa) is a heterogeneous disease both within and across individuals. Genomic alterations, epigenetic changes, and interactions with cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to different states in tumor cells. Single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) can provide insights into the transcriptional heterogeneity of tumor cells and cell types in the TME. However, most scRNAseq studies are limited by small sample sizes. Here, we performed the first gene program association study in PCa to identify gene modules and immune cell types associated with intra-tumoral heterogeneity and metastasis.



 14 datasets were merged to create a harmonized scRNAseq atlas. Copy number inference and boosted gradient tree models were trained to identify the tumor cells. Celda was used to identify co-expression modules. Linear mixed effect models were used to associate modules with clinical phenotypes. Finally, a transformer model similar to RoBERTa for annotation of PCa datasets was developed and validated in 2 independent datasets.



 We compiled an atlas of 560, 492 cells from 128 PCa patients with localized primary PCa, Castration resistant PCa (CRPC), and metastatic PCa from 7 different sites. 166 co-expression modules were identified across 106, 998 tumor cells. 2 cell-cycle modules were consistently upregulated across all metastatic sites while prostate lineage and antigen presentation modules were consistently downregulated. Different metastatic sites exhibited unique module expression patterns. For example, a module of FOLH1 and SPON2 was upregulated specifically in brain metastasis while erythroid modules were found in liver metastasis. 4 different modules were significantly higher in neuroendocrine prostate cancers (NEPC). Each NE tumor was not monolithic but expressed a unique combination of these modules. A novel subtype of NEPC tumors was identified which predominantly expresses the HES1 module instead of the canonical NE module. We developed a novel scoring system to identify NEPC tumors in bulk RNA-seq data using a combination of NE-associated modules which performed better than previously established gene set signatures (AUC = 0.938). Within the TME, we detected a T-cell cluster signified by heat shock protein genes enriched in African American PCa patients than European American patients. Furthermore, a transformer neural network was developed for automated annotation of scRNAseq PCa datasets which achieved a 91% accuracy in validation datasets.



 We generated a comprehensive atlas of cells from PCa, characterized novel gene programs that defined tumors cells in localized and metastatic samples, identified a novel subtype of NEPC, and developed a robust computational tool to predict these states in new studies. These findings can potentially be used clinically to stratify high-risk patients with localized disease.

 Metastasis is responsible for approximately 90% of cancer-related deaths, yet current therapies fail to effectively address this critical challenge. The tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), plays a pivotal role in metastatic progression by driving extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and immune evasion. Within metastatic CAFs (mCAFs), we identified a key protein that regulates these processes and developed Akos, a small molecule that selectively inhibits this protein, reprogramming the TME to disrupt the metastatic cascade. This study evaluates the preclinical efficacy, specificity, and safety of Akos across multiple solid tumor models.



 Primary stromal cell cultures were obtained from needle biopsies of primary tumors from patients with advanced/metastatic cancer (mCAFs), non-metastatic cancer (CAFs), and non-cancerous patients (BAFs). Protein expression was validated through gene profiling, immunohistochemistry, and western blot. In vitro assays were conducted to assess Akos’ ability to inhibit mCAF-mediated tumor cell invasion, proliferation, and EMT marker expression. In vivo xenograft models of prostate, breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers were utilized to evaluate Akos’ effects on tumor growth, weight, and metastatic spread. A spontaneous metastasis assay, replicating the full metastatic cascade, was employed to evaluate its anti-metastatic potential. Toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to assess systemic safety and drug stability.



 Akos demonstrated significant in vitro efficacy, inhibiting mCAF-driven tumor cell invasion and proliferation while reducing EMT marker expression. In in vivo xenograft models, Akos reduced tumor volume by 50-fold and tumor weight by 30-fold compared to untreated controls. In the spontaneous metastasis assay, Akos completely blocked 100% of metastatic foci across all tested models. Toxicology studies confirmed Akos’ safety profile, with no significant off-target effects observed, while pharmacokinetics showed stable systemic exposure.



 These findings position Akos as a promising therapeutic candidate for targeting the TME to address the unmet need in metastatic cancer treatment. By inhibiting a key protein in mCAFs, Akos effectively disrupts the processes driving metastatic progression, offering a novel approach to halting the spread of cancer. The observed efficacy across multiple tumor types, combined with its favorable safety profile, supports further clinical investigation of Akos as a first-in-class therapeutic for metastatic solid tumors. These results underscore the potential of targeting the TME to improve patient outcomes and advance the standard of care in oncology.

With the rapid development of single-cell sequencing technology, we can now delve deeper into the cellular composition and dynamic changes within the tumor microenvironment, revealing cellular interactions and their potential roles in tumorigenesis.In this study, we systematically analyzed comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing data from 25 colorectal cancer and 10 adjacent normal tissue samples. We explored the characteristics and biological significance of tumor cell subpopulations, performed quality control, dimensionality reduction, and cell type identification, and further investigated epithelial cell copy number variations, cell communication, and pseudotime analysis. Subsequently, Boruta feature selection algorithm was combined to identify prognosis related genes. The expression patterns, clinical significance and biological effects of PRSS22 were validated in vitro.Our analysis found an epithelial cell subcluster with high expression of PRSS22 exhibited high proliferation and migration abilities, and it was also associated with the dysregulated immune microenvironment. After further experimental verification, we proved the high expression patterns and clinical significance of PRSS22. Downregulation of PRSS22 in CRC cells resulted in a reduction of proliferation, migration and invasion.Our study has identified a cell subcluster that is closely linked to progression, immune dysregulation and prognosis in CRC, and we have also identified PRSS22 as its hub gene that has great potential to become a new immunotherapeutic targets target for CRC.">

 The combination of sitravatinib, nivolumab, and ipilimumab offers a novel approach to enhance immunotherapy outcomes in advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). To explore the immunomodulatory and resistance mechanisms underlying this triplet therapy, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on tumor samples collected longitudinally from 12 patients across treatment timepoints. Transcriptomic data from 70,526 cells, including 58,331 tumor microenvironment (TME) cells, revealed dynamic shifts in cellular composition and transcriptional states during therapy. Analysis of TME cells identified eight major cell types, with notable increases in T cells and reductions in myeloid and endothelial cells post-treatment. Baseline T cell abundance correlated with improved clinical response, while fibroblast enrichment predicted resistance. Tumor cells were classified into ten transcriptionally distinct clusters, including a treatment-resistant population (C8) enriched in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, and glycolysis signatures. These signatures correlated with shorter progression-free survival in the trial cohort and worse survival outcomes in an external TCGA ccRCC dataset. T cell states showed a transition from cytotoxic to exhausted phenotypes in non-responders and end-of-treatment samples, suggesting a role for T cell dysfunction in resistance. Similarly, myeloid cells exhibited a shift toward immunosuppressive phenotypes, characterized by M2-like macrophages and inhibitory signaling pathways. These findings elucidate resistance mechanisms to the triplet therapy, highlighting EMT-driven tumor cell states and immunosuppressive TME dynamics as key contributors. The identification of a tumor-specific C8 signature provides a potential biomarker for predicting poor responses and tailoring therapeutic strategies. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed to optimize patient selection and therapeutic outcomes.

 High-risk Group 3 and Group 4 and recurrent medulloblastoma patients have a dismal prognosis, and emerging targeted therapies have not yielded promising results. While CAR T cell therapy has achieved unprecedented success in treating hematologic malignancies, translating this approach to solid tumors has been challenging due to tumor heterogeneity and the immunosuppressive microenvironment. To overcome these obstacles and address the urgent need for new treatments, we aimed to develop an enhanced multi-specific CAR T cell product targeting the antigens GPC2, GD2, and B7H3, which are described to be highly expressed across cancers, notably in tumors of neuroectodermal origin. We first conducted a comprehensive analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data to validate the expression of GPC2, GD2, and B7H3 on medulloblastoma samples. Protein expression of these targets was confirmed on medulloblastoma cell lines and PDX models, and confirmation on patient samples using flow cytometry-based Quantibrite analysis is currently ongoing. Based on these findings, we generated tri-specific CAR T cells using the STASH select platform - a method for enriching cells containing multiple genetic modifications via a single selection marker - and performed phenotypic and functional assays in vitro and in vivo. Our initial results show that the selected tri-specific CAR T cells effectively control pooled populations of tumor cells expressing each of the antigens individually or in combination. However, we observed that the phenotype and function are dominated by the CAR with the highest level of tonic signaling, which decreased the overall efficacy of the tri-specific CAR T cells. By implementing downregulation of MED12, we found that the tri-specific CAR T cells demonstrated increased proliferation upon stimulation and enhanced cytotoxic efficacy in repeated stimulation assays, indicating exhaustion resistance. Further T cell engineering, including overexpression of cJUN and in vivo evaluations of antitumor activity in different mouse models are ongoing. In conclusion, our tri-specific CAR T cell product targeting GPC2, GD2, and B7H3 represents a promising novel therapeutic approach to overcoming T cell-intrinsic (exhaustion) and extrinsic (antigen heterogeneity) limitations in treating high-risk medulloblastoma. Ongoing studies aim to further assess their effectiveness and potential for broader clinical application.

 Background:
 The groundbreaking neoadjuvant ICB clinical trials have established beyond doubt that ICB before surgery will become the new standard of care for metastatic melanoma. Importantly, the shift from radiographic to pathologic response scoring offers an unprecedented window of opportunity to interrogate a goldmine of ‘on-treatment’ biospecimens. To date, single-cell profiling and region-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) have highlighted the importance of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and stem-like T-cells as positive predictors of ICB response. However, the molecular mechanisms by which tumor infiltrating lymphocytes communicate and organize multicellular immune hubs within the spatial context of the tumor ecosystem remains poorly understood.
 Methods:
 To identify robust biomarkers of response to neoadjuvant ICB, we assembled a cohort of 58 stage III melanoma patients treated with neoadjuvant ICB [24 ipilimumab-nivolumab (IPI-NIVO), 21 NIVO-relatlimab (RELA), 13 PD1 mono] and deployed transformative technologies and computational methods, including single-cell FFPE sequencing, multiplexed FISH single-cell ST (MERFISH 305 genes), digital pathology, 3D open-top light-sheet imaging and AI-based computational pathology, to decipher the complex neoadjuvant ICB tumor ecosystem in response to therapy. We also developed 2 critical computational tools, SCIRA (Spatial Cellular Interaction and Receptor Activation), to compute receptor-ligand (R-L) interactions in whole slide images, and GC-SCAN (graph-based spatial clustering against noise), a graph-based algorithm that quantifies locally clustered structures from spatial -omics data.
 Results:
 Our results showed that the quantity and size of hyper-expanded germinal center/TLS, with increased GC: non-GC B-cell ratio, plasma cells and spatially resolved stem-like T-cells are strongly associated with response. IPI-NIVO elicited significantly stronger GC proliferation compared to NIVO-RELA and PD1 monotherapy, suggesting anti-CTLA4 can robustly induce germinal center/TLS proliferation. SCIRA spatial R-L analyses revealed the critical chemokine R-L interactions that organize the GC- and T-cell zones in response to therapy. Lastly, 3D light-sheet imaging revealed remarkable morphologic heterogeneity in 3D, with interconnected GC-TLS networks that are indicative of long-range molecular gradients.
 Conclusions:
 Our investigations herein have provided a comprehensive characterization of the immune architectures, cellular communications and 3D large-scale morphologic organizations of the TME that drive response to neoadjuvant ICB therapy. We believe the results of this study will enable the development of robust predictive biomarkers to guide the design of next generation combination ICB therapies in the clinical trial setting for melanoma and other cancer types.

 Glioblastoma remains a highly malignant, inevitably recurring brain tumor with dismal prognosis. Tumor progression is influenced by cellular interactions between the tumor and its microenvironment, yet quantitative data on these interactions, particularly under standard of care therapy, remains sparse. We utilized spatial, single-cell, multiome profiling to map therapy-induced changes in the architecture of >700 paired glioblastoma samples derived from 101 patients at diagnosis and recurrence. This approach categorized patients into groups reflecting specific evolutionary responses to therapy, with implications for prognosis and treatment. Favourable outcomes were linked to shifts towards enriched perivascular, oligodendrocyte-progenitor-like niches with deep tissue infiltration of activated immune cells, whereas poor outcomes correlated with shifts towards an immunosuppressive mesenchymal environment with poor immune infiltration. Finally, while mutations in EGFR/PTEN, or MGMT-promoter methylation influenced tumor evolution, we also identified a defined subset of patients that were more responsive to lomustine after early recurrence. Our findings offer a framework to stratify patient treatment based on tumor and microenvironmental evolution.

        <tr id="Background Neuroblastoma, the most common pediatric extracranial solid tumor, has heterogeneous clinical outcomes ranging from malignant progression to spontaneous regression. With the highest frequency of the elusive spontaneous regression, low-risk INSS Stage 4S neuroblastoma represents an ideal model for mechanistic investigation. Spontaneous regression is often accompanied by tumor differentiation, but the mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unclear. Methods Single-nucleus transcriptomics (snRNA-seq) data of neuroblastoma samples were obtained from the Synapse repository to investigate the composition of heterogeneous tumor cell clusters. The feature of the Stage 4S-specific tumor cell subpopulation was revealed through differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and pseudotime analysis, followed by clinical significance validation on public cohort datasets. The biological function of secreted SLIT3 was validated using multiple in vitro models, including recombinant protein treatment, conditioned medium treatment, and cell lines coculture, to confirm the intratumoral crosstalk effect. Orthotopic and subcutaneous xenograft models were established to verify SLIT3's in vivo function. Cellular bulk RNA-seq analysis was performed with or without SLIT3 recombinant protein treatment to discover the downstream pathways activated by SLIT3, followed by validation with specific pathway inhibitors. Results Analysis of snRNA-seq revealed a distinct subpopulation of tumor cells within INSS Stage 4S neuroblastoma, characterized by a spontaneous regression-like program progressing toward differentiation. Activated SLIT-ROBO signaling was found in the Stage 4S-specific tumor cell subpopulation, which strongly correlated with favorable prognosis. Further investigation into the secreted ligands in SLIT-ROBO related pathways revealed that SLIT3 displayed the most potent enrichment in Stage 4S tumors and the strongest differentiation-inducing effect. In vitro experiments using recombinant SLIT3 protein, conditioned medium, and cell lines coculture consistently demonstrated the capacity of SLIT3 to induce neuroblastoma cell differentiation via intratumoral crosstalk, as evidenced by increased neurite outgrowth and elevated expression of neuronal differentiation markers. Both orthotopic xenograft and subcutaneous xenograft models demonstrated that SLIT3 expression suppressed tumor growth, leading to in vivo tumor differentiation. Mechanistically, PLCβ/PKC signaling mediates the SLIT3-induced neuroblastoma cell differentiation. Conclusions Stage 4S-specific tumor cell subpopulation exhibits a spontaneous regression-like program, from which SLIT3 mediates intratumoral crosstalk and promotes neuroblastoma differentiation via PLCβ/PKC signaling. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of spontaneous regression in neuroblastoma and offer novel therapeutic targets for differentiation-based treatment strategies.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a prevalent and lethal disease with limited treatment options. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which comprise up to 30% of the GBM mass, play a pivotal role in shaping the TME by supporting tumor growth and establishing an immunosuppressive and inflammatory environment. To investigate how tumor cells affect TAMs during TME evolution, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomics (SCT) datasets from GBM patient-derived tumor mass (Core) and peri-tumoral adjacent tissues (Margin), alongside murine datasets from healthy and GL261-bearing brains. This comparison aimed to clarify the immunological landscapes of GBM and identify specific interactions between tumor cells and TAMs. Margin SCT data revealed increased cellular heterogeneity compared to the Core, with immune cells, tumor cells, and brain stromal cells contributing 57%, 3%, and 40% of the total cell population, respectively. UCell analysis of GBM subtype signatures demonstrated a strong association between TAMs in the Margin and mesenchymal signatures, which are linked to poor prognosis. Further reclustering of TAMs in Margin and the comparison with murine SCT datasets showed that these cells were predominantly derived from peripheral monocytes and macrophages, with M1-like TAMs representing the majority. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed that M1-like TAMs serve as precursors to protumoral M2 TAMs. Cell-cell communication mediated by ligand-receptor interactions among tumor cells, TAMs, T cells, and NK cells identified a critical interaction between tumor-derived ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) and C5AR1 on TAMs. C5AR1 was highly expressed in M1-like TAMs across patient and murine datasets, while RPS19 was ubiquitously expressed by all cell types. In vitro models confirmed that M1 macrophages and microglia exhibited higher C5AR1 expression than their M2 counterparts. Analysis of public datasets (The Cancer Genome Atlas-GBM and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas) showed elevated C5AR1 expression in GBM tissues, particularly in recurrent tumors, and a strong correlation between high C5AR1 expression and poor patient survival. Additionally, tumor-derived RPS19 was released extracellularly under growth stress or therapeutic interventions, promoting an inflammatory TME through M1 TAM polarization and driving GBM progression. These findings suggest that targeting the RPS19-C5AR1 axis, in combination with current therapies, may represent a promising strategy to improve GBM outcomes.

 Cancer progression remains a clinical challenge due to tumor heterogeneity. Effective T cell infiltration is critical for mounting an anti-tumor response. Tumors are classified as “hot” or “cold” based on the extent of T cell infiltration. In many cancers, particularly breast cancer, extracellular matrix (ECM) geometry evolves with tumor progression, characterized by Tumor-Associated Collagen Signatures (TACS). Specifically, empirically observed ECM topologies are random fibers (TACS1), circumferentially aligned fibers (TACS2), and radially arranged fibers (TACS3). Clinically, patients with TACS3+ breast cancer exhibit poorer survival compared to TACS3- cases, but the underlying mechanisms and the role of evolving ECM geometry in tumor evolution and tumor-T cell interaction remain unclear. The lack of biomarkers or methods to track TACS evolution underscores the need for physical models linking ECM geometry to tumor-immune co-evolution.



 To address this, we developed the EVO-ACT (EVOlutionary Agent-based Cancer T cell interaction) model, built upon the Gillespie algorithm.



 Our analysis of the three TACS geometries revealed distinct T cell migration patterns and efficiencies: TACS3 demonstrated the highest efficiency, TACS1 intermediate, and TACS2 the lowest. While TACS geometry significantly influences T cell infiltration, it does not act as an absolute barrier; stronger chemokine gradients enhance T cell infiltration across all TACS types. Notably, TACS3 facilitates immune recognition and correlates with higher survival in our simulations, which contrasts with the clinically observed lower survival of TACS3+ breast cancer patients. As TACS3 is typically linked to late-stage breast tumors with phenotypic adaptations, we incorporated mechanisms such as EMT into our model to address this discrepancy. The progression from TACS2 to TACS3, coupled with EMT, more accurately reproduced clinical outcomes. Considering the mesenchymal phenotype’s ability to upregulate immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-1/PD-L1, we further explored TACS-specific tumor evolution and its impact on responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors and patient survival. Our findings reveal lower survival in TACS3/EMT+/PD-L1+ cases compared to TACS2/EMT-/PD-L1+ cases, highlighting that TACS3-associated poor survival arises not solely from ECM geometry but from late-stage cancer adaptations such as EMT and upregulated immune checkpoint expression.



 This study underscores the complex interplay between evolving ECM geometry and tumor-T cell interaction dynamics, offering a new explanation for TACS-associated survival differences. It also provides novel insights into TACS-specific responses to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and their implications for patient survival.

 Tumor heterogeneity remains an obstacle in the treatment of melanoma, with unique tumor microenvironments contributing to therapy resistance and differential tumor growth. Dedifferentiated melanoma states have been associated with resistance to targeted and immunotherapy. AXL and NGFR are dedifferentiation markers linked to these states; however, the mechanisms by which they interact or result in distinct tumor programs remain unclear. Both AXL and NGFR have been linked to therapy resistance. AXL has been associated with cell survival, proliferation and immune suppression and NGFR with tumor progression, invasion, metastasis and therapy resistance. Understanding these interactions is critical for identifying therapeutic strategies and improving patient outcomes. In a melanoma patient with longitudinal tumor samples, we used highly multiplexed cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF) and matched H&E to study the tumor and immune states associated with progression. Spatial transcriptomic profiling was performed using GeoMX on selected regions of interest to further study tumor states characterized by different morphology and proteomic differentiation markers. In the primary and in-transit metastasis, we observed intratumoral heterogeneity, with histologically distinct tumor nodules. CyCIF of the in-transit sample showed upregulation of AXL in one nodule and NGFR in the other. The NGFR nodule was characterized by densely packed tumor cells, while the AXL nodule featured an inner cleft region encased by dense peripheral tumor cells. In the NGFR nodule, differential expression analysis (DEA) revealed upregulation of EPAS1, HIF1A, ERBB3 and VEGFA suggesting hypoxic stress, cell signaling, active angiogenesis and cell migration. Transcription factor analysis (TFA) showed upregulation of HDGF, TGFB1I1, HOXA7, IRF6 and SRSF2, TFs associated with proliferation, differentiation and increased translational activity. Downregulated HIP2K and PAWR suggest apoptosis inhibition, further facilitating tumor survival and expansion. In the AXL nodule, DEA revealed increased CDKN1A, indicating stress response and altered cell cycle regulation. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) highlighted WNT and Hedgehog signaling, hormonal responses (e.g., estrogen signaling), and metabolic alterations (bile acid metabolism, myogenesis). EMT upregulation suggested a mesenchymal-like phenotype associated with resistance. TFA showed elevated KLF8 and TGFB1I1 driving EMT and metastasis, while SRSF2, HSF4, CXXC1, and NR1H2 suggested stress resilience, apoptosis regulation, and ER stress mitigation. Distinct signaling in AXL and NGFR regions suggests NGFR drives metabolic activity and proliferation, while AXL promotes resilience via stress and hormonal signaling. These findings offer insights into therapies targeting melanoma heterogeneity and resistance.

 Single cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) remains the method of choice to quantify and annotate cellular heterogeneity in the tumor and its microenvironment (TME), yet most studies are under-powered to associate changes in tumor heterogeneity with phenotypes such as tumor subtype, grade, and patient age, among others. In this study, we created an integrated atlas of human breast cancer (BC), the largest resource of its kind, totaling more than 700, 000 cells across 145 patients, and optimized computational methods to benchmark integration performance, and robustly perform hierarchical cell type annotation. By combining single profiles, a higher-resolution annotation of immune, stromal, and epithelial cell types was achieved. Further, using this integrated atlas, differential abundance analyses identified significant changes in immune and stromal cell type composition associated with tumor grade, subtype, and inferred metabolic comorbidities. For insulin resistance and obesity, we identified significant expansion in exhausted CD4 T Cell populations and interferon signalling in CD8 and macrophage populations. These changes in TME heterogeneity were not discernible or had effects in discordant directions when the analysis was limited to individual BC studies, highlighting the need for atlas-based mega-analysis approaches. This highly-resolved integrated scRNAseq BC atlas represents a valuable resource for hypothesis-driven analyses of tumor heterogeneity.

 Breast cancer has become the most commonly diagnosed malignancy, with metastasis remaining the leading cause of mortality, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we applied spatial transcriptomics with an 8 μm resolution to analyze the primary tumor and lung metastasis, occurring six months post-recurrence, of a TNBC patient, encompassing a total of 1, 033, 074 bins. Through this analysis, six tumor clusters (T0-T5) with distinct gene expression profiles were identified. Among these, T0 and T3 were the predominant clusters observed in the metastatic tumor. T0 was primarily distributed in the tumor core, while T3 localized at the tumor boundary. Both clusters exhibited high expression of VIM, a marker associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed that T3 displayed elevated levels of genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling pathways. Trajectory analysis indicated that T3 represented the most advanced differentiation stage as a subclone.

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed cancer therapy and is now approved in every type of cancer, yet it remains difficult to identify the ∼ 20% of patients that will benefit from such therapy. Explainable models that predict ICB response can potentially spare ‘responders’ from toxic chemotherapies while identifying alternative options for ‘non-responders’. The only widely approved ICB biomarker of response, PD-L1, treats TME cells as individual components and is only weakly predictive of outcomes. Recent studies have suggested that biomarkers built on cell-to-cell spatial proximity, such as tumor cell to CD8+ T cell distance, can improve upon PD-L1 in predicting ICB efficacy. Yet, there is a lack of generalized approaches for identifying tumor spatial biology relationships relevant to ICB response, especially considering the wealth of information generated by high-resolution spatial biology techniques. Our approach was (1) to integrate spatial transcriptomics datasets from 96 tumors across twelve tumor types and (2) to apply statistical covariation approaches to identify organizing principles of spatial biology that would facilitate the comparison of these datasets. The basis of this approach is our identification of a conserved unit of pan-tumor spatial organization that we termed ‘Spatial Groups’. Spatial Groups (SGs) are multi-cellular units demonstrating coordinated transcriptional programs contained within spatial domains ranging in size from tens of microns (dozens of cells) to mm-scale (large regions of a tumor). SGs are hierarchically organized such that large-scale SGs exert contextual field effects on their nested small-scale SGs. For example, we found that T cell presence in large-scale SGs impacted metabolic pathway shifts occurring within nested medium-scale SGs, which in turn impacted cell adhesion programs within nested small-scale SGs. We found that SGs revealed immune-related spatial biology patterns that we hypothesized would serve as a genome-wide spatial biomarker of ICB response. To test this idea, we performed a retrospective study of 16 patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with ICB or chemotherapy-ICB in the frontline setting. Unlike PD-L1 status, our SG-derived biomarker was highly significant in predicting progression-free survival after therapy initiation. Additionally, analysis of SGs in non-responder patients provided insights into patient-specific spatial biology architectures limiting ICB efficacy. In summary, our discovery of Spatial Groups provides a general framework for using spatial biology to identify pan-tumor ICB response.

        <tr id="Simple Summary This review highlights the role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in shaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options. TAMs, which constitute a substantial portion of the TME, exhibit high phenotypic plasticity and dynamically shift between pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive states. GBM exploits this plasticity to drive tumor growth by inducing TAM polarization toward the immunosuppressive phenotype through mechanisms involving cytokine secretion, immune checkpoint pathways, and metabolic interactions. This polarization contributes to immune evasion, tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs include depletion, reprogramming toward the pro-inflammatory phenotype, and inhibiting pro-tumor signals. Several approaches are under investigation, such as blocking CSF-1R, disrupting CCL2/CCR2 and PI3K pathways, targeting PD-L1 expression, and utilizing nanoparticle-based delivery systems for selective TAM modulation. Further research targeting TAM plasticity and polarization is essential for developing treatments that overcome GBM’s robust immunosuppressive TME and improve patient survival.">

We discuss the context-specific consequences of ARID1A deficiency, its cooperation with other oncogenic events, and its implications for therapeutic vulnerability—particularly in the realm of synthetic lethality and immune modulation. By mapping ARID1A’s functional impact onto the established hallmarks framework, we highlight its centrality in cancer biology and underscore opportunities for biomarker-driven strategies and targeted interventions.

 Tumorigenesis is influenced by various environmental factors, including growth-induced solid stress and fluid pressure, both of which are key drivers of tumor progression and resistance to therapy. While certain tumors arise in regions exposed to significant weight-pressure, how macroscopic mechanostress affects the tumor microenvironment remains largely unclear. In this study, we showed that macroscopic mechanostress disrupts nuclear envelope integrity. Single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrated that the macroscopic pressure shows changes in gene expression within tumor microenvironment cells and reshaped fibroblast subtypes.In spatial transcriptomics, using a distance-based tumor border detection model, we can determine spatially resolved fine layers of tumor margin and peritumor regions. We found an increased proportion of fibroblasts, especially Lrrc15-positive myofibroblasts, located in peritumor region facing the tumor border. We also showed upregulated metastasis signature and immune inhibitory signature indicating that mechanostress-driven transcriptional changes promote metastasis and resistance to immunotherapy. Using a mouse plantar melanoma model, we found that exogenous mechanostress, mimicked by genetic disruption of the nuclear lamina, induces nuclear envelope rupture in melanoma cells and increases the number of Lrrc15-positive myofibroblasts. Interestingly, these myofibroblasts further contribute to nuclear envelope rupture in melanoma cells, creating a feedback loop. Together, our findings highlight a critical role for mechanostress in cancer progression, driven by nuclear envelope damage and shifts in tumor-stromal interactions.

        <tr id="Human complex in vitro models (CIVMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential to study tissue development, physiology and disease at high-throughput. To effectively employ these miniaturized systems in translational preclinical research, their in-depth benchmarking is pivotal. Histology has been the core of tissue characterization for centuries and the foundation of spatial phenotyping. However, standard histology workflows are inherently low-throughput and centered on large tissue pieces. This does not match the high sample volumes and small sample sizes in CIVM research. Here, we introduce a holistic ‘histo-workflow’, utilizing 3D-printed histomolds that facilitate co-planar embedding of CIVMs at high-throughput, resulting in up to 48 samples in one section. We developed a variety of model-specific histomold designs that enable spatially controlled histological sectioning and downstream analyses. We describe these workflows, including mold generation, highplex staining and image analysis, and exemplify their application to histological analyses of various CIVMs. Altogether, the histomolds introduced here afford opportunities for CIVM processing and analysis, while significantly reducing labor and reagent resources, thereby democratizing high-throughput CIVM in histopathology.">

 Chemotherapy remains the most used systemic treatment option for triple-negative breast cancer. Lineage tracing studies demonstrated that the treatment does not significantly alter the clonal composition of primary breast tumors. Nevertheless, the specific transcriptional phenotype(s) conferring chemoresistance at primary tumor (PT) level, as well as at metastatic level, are still largely undetermined, specifically at single-clone resolution.To tackle such unmet clinical issues, we leveraged our recently published in vivo single-cell lineage tracing approach under therapeutic pressure, using two chemotherapeutic agents: adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (A+C). Upon administration of A+C we obtained stable disease, as confirmed by histopathological and IHC analyses. Chemoresistance was formally demonstrated by ex vivo IC50.By using single-cell lineage tracing on treated and untreated matched PT-lung metastases, we found that chemotherapy shifted clonal hierarchy, with few high-fit clones outcompeting the others, at primary level. Despite this, we noticed the striking increase of pro-metastatic clone frequencies in the chemoresistant model, thus suggesting that chemotherapy selects for few highly-aggressive clones. At metastatic level we found general drop of clonality.Using scRNA-seq, we observed that chemotherapy shapes distinct chemoresistant patterns in the PT and metastases. We then explored the transcriptomics features of the most fit clones within treated tumors, so-called dominant: they were characterized by enrichment of distinctive cancer hallmarks with respect of the whole chemoresistant tumor, including tumor-promoting inflammation and sustained angiogenesis.Chemoresistant/pro-metastatic clones were characterized by the expression of genes that were prognostic for poor survival across patients. Importantly, we observed that the chemoresistant/pro-metastatic phenotype was exacerbated by re-challenge with the same treatment but also stable across multiple re-transplantations. Among the of chemoresistant/pro-metastatic genes, PAEP appeared as the top marker. This was corroborated by GRN analyses, where we observed that the network around PAEP was extremely perturbed by therapeutic pressure. We tested the pro-metastatic effect of PAEP expression in a chemoresistant scenario. We orthotopically injected MDA-MB-231 cells silenced for PAEP expression via shRNA into recipient NSG mice and we performed neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. Upon PAEP silencing, we observed slight increase of chemosensitivity at primary tumor level. Strikingly, chemoresistant metastases formation was significantly impaired by PAEP downregulation, as compared to controls.Overall, our data demonstrate that the pro-metastatic phenotype of chemoresistant breast cancer is stable, transcriptionally defined and driven by the expression of PAEP.

        <tr id="The processes that lead to cancer transformation, in particular the clonal evolution that precedes malignancy, remain incompletely understood. Somatic mutations accumulate throughout the life of a cell and are shaped by its epigenetic landscape. We hypothesize that integrating somatic mutational profiles with the epigenetic landscapes of normal cells can explain the distribution of mutations in cancer, provide insights into the relationships between normal and cancer cells, and thus shed light on the cellular origins of cancer. Our study integrates mutation data from more than 25 normal tissue types with epigenetic profiles from over 300 normal cell types. Using random forest regression, we show that mutational distributions in normal cells closely match the epigenetic landscapes of their corresponding cell types. For example, the mutational profile of normal breast tissue maps to the epigenomes of luminal progenitor cells, indicating that these mutations are predominantly acquired during the progenitor cell state. In contrast, mutations observed in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) closely aligns with the epigenomes of mature luminal cells, reflecting a distinct pattern of mutation accumulation in the precancerous state compared to normal tissue. Building on this, we extended our analysis to cancer by comparing normal mutational profiles with data from 2,550 whole genomes spanning 32 cancer types. This reveals both close relationships and distinct origins of different cancer types and subtypes. For example, the different molecular subtypes of breast cancer are associated with specific cell types of the luminal cell lineage, with basal-like subtypes originating from luminal progenitors and all other subtypes (LumA, LumB, Her2) from luminal mature cells. Together, these findings demonstrate that both normal and cancer tissues retain a mutational profile ‘scar’ that reflects the ancestral cell state in which these mutations originally arose. This genomic ‘historical record’ of somatic mutations is a powerful tool for tracing the cellular origins of cancer and provides a framework for understanding how somatic evolution in normal tissues sets the stage for tumor initiation and subtype differentiation. With this approach, we are advancing our understanding of tumorigenesis and subtype differentiation, paving the way for more precise cancer diagnosis and tailored therapeutic strategies.

 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is complex and plays a key role in cancer development, progression and metastasis. Two layers of information are critical for understanding tumor compositions (1) the proportion of each cell type (2) the level of gene expression in each cell type.
 Many single-cell profile-assisted algorithms have been developed to infer cell type proportions from bulk RNA-seq data, including CIBERSORTx, MuSic and Scaden, and there are several benchmark studies published to compare the methods. However, most of the deconvolution methods do not support prediction of gene expression in a heterogenous population of tumor cells, and there’s no published study systemically comparing the gene expression prediction performance of the methods.
 To overcome the limitations, we simulate large-scale of pseudobulk data using scRNA-seq profiling from lung tumors, representing various levels of tumor purities and cell lineages, to compare the cell fraction and gene expression prediction performance of recently published TME deconvolution methods. Our results indicate BayesPrism is the best at predicting gene expression in each of the cell types, and differential gene expression between two groups across cell types, especially in tumor epithelial cells, with higher balanced accuracy and correlation with ground truth. The inclusion of normal epithelial cells in the reference could increase additional risks for tumor deconvolution.
 Altogether we evaluate both cell type proportion and gene expression prediction performance of recently published methods and offer a guideline for future benchmarking work. Currently we're working on the downstream application of inferring cellular composition and gene expression in large cohorts of bulk RNA-seq data, allowing for more insights into tumor-intrinsic expression and tumor-microenvironment interactions.

 Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) often have metastatic disease at diagnosis and respond poorly to therapies. High myeloid-to-T cell ratios correlate with worse prognoses, but a more detailed, integrated understanding of mechanisms by which myeloid cells regulate metastasis is critically needed. Using high-parameter spatial profiling, we recently observed that a highly metastatic tumor cell line utilizes mesenchymal invasion and harbors a tumor microenvironment with increased endothelial cell abundance, lower M1-like to M2-like tumor associated macrophage (TAM) ratios, and Arginase-1+ TAMs situated closer to tumor and endothelial cells, compared to a less metastatic model. These models were further interrogated to study the myeloid drivers of metastasis in the primary and metastatic sites.



 We used two murine cell lines driven by KrasG12D and Trp53R172H under Pdx1-Cre, KPCY 2838c3 (“c3”) and KPCY 6419c5 (“c5”), which exhibit low-metastatic and high-metastatic propensities, respectively. Imaging mass cytometry was used to determine the changes in the primary tumor and pre-metastatic microenvironments. TAMs and endothelial cells from the primary site were evaluated using RNAseq. In vitro tube formation assays were performed to evaluate the potential factors driving vascularization.



 In the pancreatic site, the highly metastatic c5 model was significantly enriched for metastasis- and angiogenesis-promoting pathways, including the RANK/RANKL axis. In vitro tube formation assays revealed that c5-derived TAMs induce greater tube formation over those from the c3 model and that RANKL significantly promotes tube formation. Moreover, in the hepatic premetastatic site, the c5 tumors expanded Kupffer, stellate, and endothelial cells to a greater extent than c3 tumors. Finally, the c5 tumors recruit fewer lymphocytes and more granulocytes to the liver, suggesting poorer immune protection against metastasis.



 Our study highlights multiple tumor-intrinsic and extrinsic factors responsible for metastasis, and that TAMs serve as a critical integration point. Interestingly, we found the RANK/RANKL axis, for which there is already an inhibitory agent that is clinically used, to be a potential mechanism underlying the TAM-endothelial crosstalk. Together, these data prompt further exploration of the observed TAM-endothelial relationship and the premetastatic remodeling in human PDAC, as well as the targetability of the RANK/RANKL axis for disrupting PDAC metastasis.

 Background:
 Uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) is a rare gynecologic malignancy that has poor clinical outcomes and few targeted therapies. This aggressive variant of endometrial carcinoma has a uniquely biphasic appearance and morphology of metastases from these tumors can be carcinoma, sarcoma, or carcinosarcoma. The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a crucial role in the behavior of cancers. Recent advances in single cell spatial transcriptomics allow for greater insight into the TIME of these aggressive tumors.
 Methods:
 Ten samples from four patients with multiple matched longitudinal samples underwent single-cell spatial transcriptomic (scST) profiling (Nanostring CosMx 6k). Standard segmentation and QC filters were applied. Cell typing was performed with confirmation by expert pathologist annotation of tissue regions. Normalized gene expression was compared within the clusters based on clinicopathologic characteristics.
 Results:
 scST profiling of 80,843 high-quality cells revealed 38 distinct clusters (11 carcinoma, 12 sarcoma, 9 immune, 7 benign mesenchymal). Tumor clusters were largely patient-specific with tumors demonstrating diverse transcriptional heterogeneity while metastatic tumors were composed of several less diverse clones. While immune cell clusters represented cells from all patients, there was significant patient and sample heterogeneity in the proportions of immune cell subsets observed. Macrophages were the most abundant immune cell type in all samples, plasma cells were common in one patient's samples, and rare T cells were found only in specific cellular niches. Transcriptomic features of intra-tumoral macrophages were assessed based on site (primary versus distant metastasis) and temporal (naïve versus treated with chemotherapy) groupings. Compared to tumor associated macrophages (TAM) in primary tumors, TAMs in distant metastases were more likely to have M2-like features with higher expression of
 CXCL2, CD163, CD209,
 and
 CD44
 (P<0.005). TAMs residing in chemotherapy-treated tumors had higher expression of
 IGF2, CXCL2, CXCL1, CD163, CD209, CXCL16, CD24
 ,
 CD44, CD93
 (P<0.005). Upregulation of pro-angiogenic pathways (i.e.
 VEGFA
 ) was common in both distant metastases and post-chemotherapy UCS TAMs.
 Conclusions:
 Uterine carcinosarcoma is a highly heterogeneous tumor both with respect to tumor cell and immune microenvironment features. This work highlights transcriptomic characteristics in macrophages in the UCS microenvironment. Notably, macrophages in distant metastases and in patients with prior chemotherapy were found to have more M2 TAM-like macrophages than primary untreated tumors. These results provide rationale for both TAM-based immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic approaches in UCS.

 The tumor microenvironment (TME) in glioblastoma (GBM) is remarkably intricate, characterized by its dynamic nature and high heterogeneity that significantly influence tumor progression and treatment resistance. The heterogeneous TME comprises of blood vessels, immune cells, neurons, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) presenting distinct tumor compartments that influence the tumor behavior. A recent classification based on the heterogeneous TME identified three distinct subtypes TMELow, TMEMed, and TMEHigh distinguished by varying endothelial and immune cell populations. This study explores the complex interactions between glioblastoma (GBM) and its tumor microenvironment (TME), focusing specifically on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and vascular compartment. To evaluate GBM's impact on the BBB, a compartmentalized model was developed that prevents direct cell-to-cell contact, allowing the observation of paracrine signaling. Using this model, distinct effects were identified across different GBM cell lines: one cell line caused significant BBB permeability with low transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values, while another had minimal impact on barrier integrity. To further investigate GBM-BBB interactions, a vascular network model incorporating brain endothelial cells, stromal cells and GBM cells within an extracellular matrix was developed. This model revealed consistent differences between the cell lines, aligning with the initial findings and reflected in endothelial cell morphology and vascular network density. Analysis of cytokines secreted by the GBM cell lines provided further insights into the observed changes in vascular organization. Ongoing investigation aims to use patient derived cells in this model to pick up interpatient variability and specifically look at the differences between the TME subtypes. This approach allows for the in vitro modelling and characterization of GBM TME subtypes and potentially the identification of novel druggable targets in the GBM TME.

        <tr id="Tumor heterogeneity is predicted to confer inferior clinical outcomes with precision-based strategies, however, modeling heterogeneity in a manner that still represents the tumor of origin remains a formidable challenge. Sequencing technologies are limited in their ability to identify rare subclonal populations and predict response to treatments for patients. Patient-derived organotypic cultures have significantly improved the modeling of cancer biology by faithfully representing the molecular features of primary malignant tissues. Patient-derived cancer organoid (PCO) cultures contain subclonal populations with the potential to recapitulate heterogeneity, although treatment response assessments commonly ignore diversity in the molecular profile or treatment response. Here, we demonstrate the advantage of evaluating individual PCO heterogeneity to enhance the sensitivity of these assays for predicting clinical response. Additionally, organoid subcultures identify subclonal populations with altered treatment response. Finally, dose escalation studies of PCOs to targeted anti-EGFR therapy are utilized which reveal divergent pathway expression when compared to pretreatment cultures. Overall, these studies demonstrate the importance of population-based organoid response assessments, the use of PCOs to identify molecular heterogeneity not observed with bulk tumor sequencing, and PCO heterogeneity for understanding therapeutic resistance mechanisms.

        <tr id="Abstract Oligodendrogliomas are initially slow-growing brain tumors that are prone to malignant transformation despite surgery and cytotoxic therapy. Understanding of oligodendroglioma evolution and new treatments for patients have been encumbered by a paucity of patient-matched newly diagnosed and recurrent tumor samples for multiplatform analyses, and by a lack of preclinical models for interrogation of therapeutic vulnerabilities that drive oligodendroglioma growth. Here we integrate spatial and functional analyses of tumor samples and patient-derived organoid co-cultures to show that synaptic connectivity is a hallmark of oligodendroglioma evolution and recurrence. We find that patient-matched recurrent oligodendrogliomas are enriched in synaptic gene expression programs irrespective of previous therapy or histologic grade. Analyses of spatial, single-cell, and clinical data reveal epigenetic misactivation of synaptic genes that are concentrated in regions of cortical infiltration and can be used to predict eventual oligodendroglioma recurrence. To translate these findings to patients, we show that local field potentials from tumor-infiltrated cortex at the time of resection and neuronal hyperexcitability and synchrony in patient-derived organoid co-cultures are associated with oligodendroglioma proliferation and recurrence. In preclinical models, we find that neurophysiologic drugs block oligodendroglioma growth and pathologic electrophysiology. These results elucidate mechanisms underlying oligodendroglioma evolution from an indolent tumor to a fatal disease and shed light on new biomarkers and new treatments for patients.">

 Checkpoint therapies and engineered immune cell therapies are increasingly becoming the mainstay when it comes to cancer treatments. Continued and improved success of these therapies relies on our deep understanding of the checkpoint marker and immune cell biology, cell-cell interaction in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and immune cell activation. Spatially visualizing the expression of soluble factors such as cytokines and chemokines along with immune cell markers can provide information about the immune cell composition and enable a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms underlying immune cell recruitment, infiltration and exclusion. To address this, we have developed a fully automated spatial multiomics protocol on the COMET™ platform that enables RNA detection using the RNAscope™ HiPlex Pro assay combined with protein detection using sequential immunofluorescence (seqIF™, (Rivest et al, 2023) ) to integrate same-section sequential detection of up to 12 RNAs followed by up to 24 proteins. This workflow allows the detection of any RNA and protein target of interest by utilizing existing RNAscope probes or generating a custom design for any RNA target and use standard, non-conjugated primary antibodies for protein detection. We used Lunaphore’s HORIZON™ software to analyze this multiomics dataset. Here, we have demonstrated the precise spatial profiling of FFPE solid tumors through the detection of key cytokines indicative of activated T cells and macrophages by using cytokine RNA probes targeting IFNG, IL-1B, TNFA, TGFB1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 among others in combination with cell marker antibodies detecting CD3, CD8, CD4, FOXP3 and CD68.In addition, we were also able to visualize T cell recruiting chemokines and receptors such as CXCL10, CXCL9, CXCL13, CXCL12 and CXCR3, and spatially map tumor-infiltrating T cells within tissue context and with subcellular resolution. To that end, we successfully demonstrated same-slide RNA-protein detection for profiling the TME. Using single-cell spatial multiomics we were able to identify unique phenotypes within the tumors that might directly correlate to immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory microenvironments. Detailed mapping of the cellular components of the TME has the potential to better predict therapeutic response for checkpoint and immune-based therapies.

 Metastatic breast cancer is the most aggressive form of breast cancer leading to poor disease-free patient survival and accounting for 90% of all breast cancer-related deaths. The specific mechanisms that promote metastasis are not fully understood owing to the complex interplay between cancer cells and their surrounding microenvironment. This microenvironment involves clonal and sub-clonal heterogeneity in genomic, transcriptomic and protein signaling network across different cancer cell sub-populations. Understanding the molecular mechanism behind cancer metastasis demands state of the art single cell and spatial technologies that can provide deeper insight on disease progression.
 Since, cancer is heavily influenced by genetic changes, the study of the 3D- genome organization in single cells helps to improve understanding of disease progression and prognosis. The genome is organized and packaged in a highly structured manner inside the nucleus of mammalian cells and exhibits dynamic reorganization throughout disease progression. Understanding this 3D organization at the single-cell level with high spatial resolution is crucial for disease research.
 In this abstract, we present a novel jebFISHTM protocol on the PaintScapeTM platform that can be used to understand differences in global 3D genome organization among several localized and metastatic breast cancer cell lines at single cell, sub-population and population level. Using a highly multiplexed genome wide panel of chromosomal targets, we will show disruption in chromosome territory, radius of gyration, chromosomal instability between localized and metastatic breast cancer cells at single cell and sub-population level. We will also show the signature of specific 3D genome structural alterations and interchromosomal interactions related to breast cancer metastasis compared to normal breast cells. In addition, we investigated differences in global 3D genome architecture of different breast cancer sub-types such as HER2 enriched vs triple negative breast cancer cells. We will show how different breast cancer sub-types carry specific chromosomal instability and differential interchromosomal interaction patterns at single cell, sub-chromosomal and sub-population level. We envision this study will improve our understanding on breast cancer disease progression and provide deeper insight into the underlying genomic heterogeneity of single cancer cells and sub-populations which might help to design better treatment options in the future. We propose that this study serves as proof-of-principle and is generalizable to other types of cancers where changes in 3D genome organization may occur at different cancer stages.

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), one of the most aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, is associated with poor prognosis and limited treatment options, particularly when diagnosed at later stages. The extensive inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity observed in TNBC further complicates its clinical management. Understanding the molecular difference within this TNBC is crucial for elucidating its biological characteristics and clinical behaviors, as well as for developing personalized therapeutic approaches. In this study, we employ digital spatial profiling (DSP) technology to quantitatively analyze transcript and protein abundance across spatially distinct regions of TNBC, including primary tumor cores, surrounding stroma regions, and metastatic sites. The analysis reveal marked spatial heterogeneity in gene expression profiles, cellular composition, and the immune microenvironment across these regions. Additionally, we identify distinct TNBC subtypes based on unique gene expression patterns. In primary tumor, Basal-like 1 (BL1) emerged as one of the predominant subtypes and was associated with an increased present of memory B cells. We also identified a subgroup resembling unclassified (UNS) subtypes, characterized by low macrophage levels. Moreover, tumor tissues exhibited multiple TNBC subtypes within a single tumor site. This intricate subtyping within the tumor mass underscores the challenges associated with developing effective treatment for TNBC. Our findings demonstrate the power of DSP technology in elucidating the spatial dynamics of TNBC at the molecular level. The identified molecular signatures and subtypes hold potential for improving diagnostic accuracy, enabling targeted drug development, and guiding personalized treatment approaches. Ultimately, this work underscores the utility of spatial transcriptomics for addressing the challenges posed by TNBC heterogeneity and advancing precision medicine for this aggressive cancer subtype.

        <tr id="It is now well appreciated that tumor growth depends on the tumor microenvironment (TME) comprising various non-malignant stromal cell types, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are responsible for secreting the extracellular matrix (ECM) prominent in certain solid tumors such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Despite our increasing knowledge of CAFs, therapeutic targeting of CAFs is currently not a feasible strategy, as CAFs are highly heterogeneous and extremely plastic, with each CAF population able to adopt both tumor-promoting and -restraining functions. We hypothesize that the plasticity and functional heterogeneity of CAFs can be explained by their flexible metabolism in response to environmental cues and the existence of discrete metabolic states within CAF subpopulations. While metabolic states can be predicted from single-cell transcriptomic data, this does not provide information on metabolic activity and potential, nor does it allow perturbations required for validation. Scalable and tractable methods to assess metabolic activity and CAF heterogeneity in parallel at the single cell level are needed to distinguish numerous existing CAF states do not exist. To address this need, in this work, we developed a strategy to study CAF metabolic activity and phenotypic heterogeneity at the single-cell level. We designed and optimized a 25-plex immunophenotyping panel of CAF and fibroblast markers that can be combined with numerous metabolic probes via Full Spectrum Profiling (FSP) flow cytometry. In addition, we compiled an analysis pipeline to facilitate the analysis of high-dimensional flow cytometry data. Using established 2D and 3D mono- and co-culture assays, we demonstrate the potential of our panel to be multiplexed with chemical probes for cell proliferation, lipid content, lipid uptake, fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, cholesterol content, hypoxia, or mitochondrial potential. Deploying our strategy in a KPC organoid-derived murine model of PDAC, we observed subpopulations of CAFs with differing metabolic potentials that are consistent with our predictions from transcriptomic metabolic modeling. With the high throughput and single-cell nature of FSP, our strategy represents a novel and modular tool for studying CAF phenotypic and metabolic heterogeneity.

 Fibroblast activating protein (FAP) is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention being mainly expressed in malignant tissues. Previous studies have targeted FAP using a variety of methods yet failed in clinics. Here, we utilize FAP-targeted T cell engager (TcE) in KPCY tumor models to recapitulate a pre-clinical environment. The use of FAP- TcE efficiently depleted FAP+ fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo from tumors. This resulted in bystander killing of tumor cells and tumor growth control in vivo. This therapeutic effect was not dependent on priming via lymph node activation as shown in other publications. To understand the complex interactions with FAP expression, we perform comprehensive single cell RNA-sequencing profiling before and after FAP-TcE depletion to understand the pivotal genetic roles of FAP depletion in all cell types. This analysis initially revealed a T cell exhaustion phenotype with upregulated of PD-1 on T cells after FAP-TcE treatment. However, while addition of anti-PD-1 therapy significantly enhanced tumor efficacy, complete control was absent. RNA sequencing of the fibroblasts identified depletion of a myCAF-like fibroblast and an outgrowth of a mixed CAF population with phenotypes of both myCAF and iCAF. This population correlated with tumor growth, and cell cycle gene signatures. Future work will investigate the implications of this fibroblast population’s role in subverting immune suppression.

        <tr id="Background Diverse cell types and cellular states in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are drivers of biological and therapeutic heterogeneity in ovarian cancer (OV). Characterization of the diverse malignant and immunology cellular states that make up the TME and their associations with clinical outcomes are critical for cancer therapy. However, we are still lack of knowledge about the cellular states and their clinical relevance in OV. Methods We manually collected the comprehensive transcriptomes of OV samples and characterized the cellular states and ecotypes based on a machine-learning framework. The robustness of the cellular states was validated in independent cohorts and single-cell transcriptomes. The functions and regulators of cellular states were investigated. Meanwhile, we thoroughly examined the associations between cellular states and various clinical factors, including clinical prognosis and drug responses. Results We depicted and characterized an immunophenotypic landscape of 3,099 OV samples and 80,044 cells based on a machine learning framework. We identified and validated 32 distinct transcriptionally defined cellular states from 12 cell types and three cellular communities or ecotypes, extending the current immunological subtypes in OV. Functional enrichment and upstream transcriptional regulator analyses revealed cancer hallmark-related pathways and potential immunological biomarkers. We further investigated the spatial patterns of identified cellular states by integrating the spatially resolved transcriptomes. Moreover, prognostic landscape and drug sensitivity analysis exhibited clinically relevant immunological subtypes and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Conclusion Our comprehensive analysis of TME helps leveraging various immunological subtypes to highlight new directions and targets for the treatment of cancer.

 Background:
 Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor in adults, with a median survival of ~15 months despite current therapies (surgery, radiation, temozolomide). Advances like immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, and tumor vaccines have shown suboptimal results. The 2021 WHO classification highlights molecular markers (e.g., IDH, MGMT) for better stratification, but these fail to fully capture tumor microenvironmental dynamics. Using an AI-driven transcriptomic approach, we identified novel prognostic subtypes in IDH-wildtype GBM, aiming to refine stratification, enhance understanding of tumor biology, and guide personalized therapeutic strategies.
 Methods:
 We accessed microarray data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n=353 newly diagnosed, IDH-WT GBM) for a training set and RNA-seq data from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) (n=170 primary and n=106 recurrent tumors) for validation. A proprietary SphereBio machine learning–based algorithm was used to derive transcriptomic signatures with prognostic relevance. Subtypes were assessed via Kaplan–Meier analyses in the training cohort and tested in both primary and recurrent validation cohorts. Immune/stromal infiltration was quantified using a tumor deconvolution tool (DA_505), and pathway enrichment (GAGE) was performed on the validation sets.
 Results:
 AI-driven clustering revealed three transcriptomic subtypes with significant survival differences in both the training (p<0.0001) and primary validation (p=0.0004) cohorts. In the recurrent cohort, a similar survival trend by subtype was observed, though significance was diminished (p=0.12), likely due to limited sample size and therapy-related changes. Immune/stromal deconvolution showed distinct infiltration patterns: subtypes enriched for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells correlated with prolonged survival. Pathway enrichment analysis in both primary and recurrent tumors highlighted potential targets involving embryogenesis, immune modulation, cell cycle, and stress response. The persistence of a consistent survival trend and comparable microenvironment and pathway patterns suggest that these transcriptomic subtypes remain biologically relevant even after standard treatment.
 Conclusions:
 Our integrated transcriptomic and microenvironment-focused approach identified three prognostically distinct GBM subtypes, validated across independent cohorts. These findings underscore the utility of AI-driven transcriptomic signatures for personalized stratification, with the potential to guide targeted therapeutic strategies and inform clinical trial design in GBM.

 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority of lung cancer cases, with EGFR-mutant NSCLC among never smokers being particularly prevalent in Asian populations. A major clinical challenge in treating advanced NSCLC is the development of resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), highlighting the need to comprehensively profile the cellular mechanisms underlying drug resistance. We propose to tackle this by investigating the adaptive features of residual cancer cells and the role of the tumour microenvironment in sustaining tumour growth, resistance, and disease progression. In this study, we utilise single nucleus and spatial transcriptome profiling to decipher the response of EGFR-mutant tumours in more than 30 NSCLC patients before and during on-TKI treatment, including those that have developed resistance. We present an analytical framework that maps individual residual cancer cell populations that persist after treatment. We then examine the functional phenotypes of neighbouring immune cells including T lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes on these populations, and then comparing the immune dynamics to tumours that have fully acquired resistance. Our study reveals a potential mechanism by which metabolic plasticity and paracrine signaling from myeloid cells in the lung tumour microenvironment contribute to the maintenance of cancer stem cell properties, likely driving disease recurrence. We propose to incorporate a wider range of ongoing clinical trial and preclinical data to support our current findings, and with the aim of defining novel therapeutic strategy that can selectively eliminate drug tolerant persister population in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

 Prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis significantly worsens patient prognosis, particularly when it spreads to the lungs. Understanding the mechanisms underlying PCa metastasis is crucial for developing effective therapies. Here, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model by activating MAPK pathway in the PB-Cre Pten p53 Smad4 mice, creating a model that mimics the aberrant cell signaling associated with human metastatic PCa and exhibits strong metastatic phenotype. We observed dynamic changes in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) during metastasis: circulating tumor cells (CTCs) displayed mesenchymal characteristics, while lung metastases regained epithelial features.
 Transcriptomic profiling of primary tumors, CTCs, and lung metastases revealed that lung metastatic cells (LM) upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-1α. This cytokine profile correlated with increased recruitment and activation of neutrophils in the premetastatic lung niche, as confirmed by single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry. Functional experiments demonstrated that depleting neutrophils using anti-Ly6G antibodies or inhibiting their recruitment and activation via a CXCR1/2 antagonist (currently in clinical trials) significantly reduced lung metastasis and extended survival in mice. Similarly, IL-1 receptor knockout mice showed decreased neutrophil infiltration and fewer metastatic nodules, indicating the pivotal role of IL-1 signaling in neutrophil-mediated metastasis.
 Mechanistically, we identified the transcription factor KLF4 as the master regulator of both the EMT-to-MET plasticity and IL-1α expression in metastatic cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed KLF4 binding to the IL-1α promoter, leading to the upregulation of neutrophil-recruiting cytokines. Knockdown of KLF4 in LM cells reduced IL-1α levels and metastasis, while overexpression enhanced them. Co-culture of tumor cells with neutrophils increased KLF4 expression and cytokine production, suggesting a feedback loop promoting metastasis.
 Clinical data analysis showed that high levels of KLF4 and IL-1α correlate with increased neutrophil infiltration and poorer disease-free survival in PCa patients. Our findings identify the crucial role of the KLF4/IL-1α axis and neutrophil recruitment in PCa lung metastasis. Targeting neutrophil activation or the KLF4/IL-1α signaling pathway may offer new therapeutic strategies for preventing or treating metastatic prostate cancer.

        <tr id="The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a key role in the cellular response to DNA damage. In response to DNA double strand breaks (DSB), cultured cells exhibit oscillations of p53 levels, which impact gene expression and cell fate. The dynamics of p53 in-vivo have only been studied in fixed tissues or using reporters for p53's transcriptional activity. Here we established breast tumors expressing a fluorescent reporter for p53 levels and employed intravital imaging to quantify its dynamics in response to DSB in-vivo. Our findings revealed large heterogeneity among individual cells, with most cells exhibiting a single prolonged pulse. We then tested how p53 dynamics might change under high cell confluency, one factor that differs between cell culture and tissues. We revealed that highly confluent cultured breast cancer cells also show one broad p53 pulse instead of oscillations. Through mathematical modeling, sensitivity analysis and live cell imaging we identified low levels of the phosphatase Wip1, a transcriptional target and negative regulator of p53, as a key contributor to these dynamics. Since high cell confluency better reflects the microenvironment of tissues, the impact of cell confluency on p53 dynamics may have important consequences for cancerous tissues responding to DNA damage inducing therapies.">

 Glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor, almost invariably recurs as an incurable disease after standard therapy. Molecular heterogeneity underlies the failure of current treatment and drives GBM progression. Although significant efforts have been directed at resolving the subclonal architecture, identifying and characterizing the genetic subpopulation in GBM has proven challenging. Recent advances in single-cell genomics (scWGS) have provided new opportunities for exploring the genomic complexity of tumors at unprecedented resolution. However, earlier methods of scWGS faced limitations due to poor amplification uniformity resulting in high number of artefacts. The introduction of primary template-directed amplification (PTA) has overcome this challenge allowing for more accurate detection of genomic alterations at single-cell resolution. In this study, we combined PTA scWGS of 5,689 single cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) of 41,071 single nuclei from 25 GBM samples to explore the clonal architecture and the dynamics of genetic and non-genetic subclonal programs activated in GBM. PTA-based scWGS data showed optimal performance in terms of overdispersion and coverage breadth when compared to other single cell methods for measuring somatic copy number alterations (SCNA). The SCNA substructure of GBM was reconstructed by applying a graph-based clustering to scWGS data, which identified a median of 4 subclones per tumor. GBM samples showed a heterogenous distribution of genetic clones constituted by variable numbers of cells. For each sample we computed the consensus SCNA profiles to reconstruct the genetic phylogeny of GBM. The predicted evolutionary model showed a first trajectory from the diploid cell to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with the highest number of SCNA (median 14), including frequent GBM driver alterations (chr 7 gain, chr 10 loss, EGFR amp, CDKN2A del). Conversely, number and frequency of SCNA decreased in the clades diversifying the MRCA into the later ancestors. By aligning the scWGS clonal lineages with snRNAseq gene expression profiles from the same tumors, we found significant coordination of genetic and non-genetic mechanisms that diversified tumor subpopulations and led to divergent phenotypes recurring across the patients. The functional phylogeny of GBM identified two main branches of tumor evolution that emerged from the MRCA with the activation of neuronal functions and differentiation in one clade, and the acquisition of cell cycle programs, stem cell activities, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition in the opposite clade, respectively. This multi-omics approach enabled the reconstruction of the evolutionary dynamics of GBM at both genetic and transcriptional levels, revealing critical insights into clonal evolution and therapeutic resistance.

 Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key components of the tumor microenvironment and play a critical role in tumor progression and therapy resistance. Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) enable precise analysis of gene expression within the spatial context of tissues, offering new avenues for target discovery. Using spatial and single-cell transcriptomic data, we identified a novel target protein, POR-CAF-001, predominantly expressed in CAFs within solid tumor tissues and minimally in normal tissues, making it a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention. Method Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics data from human tumor samples were analyzed using our proprietary target discovery program to identify CAF-specific targets. Two human IgG antibodies (POR-CAF-001-01 and POR-CAF-001-02) against the POR-CAF-001 were generated through phage display, ELISA screening and recombinant production in mammalian cells. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was employed to validate a binding affinity of antibodies against POR-CAF-001 protein. Also, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry (ICC) were performed to evaluate the binding specificity of the antibodies. Antibody internalization was assessed via an imaging-based internalization assay using pH-sensitive fluorophore-labeled antibodies, and their internalization was monitored over time. POR-CAF-001-positive, -negative and knockout cell lines were used to confirm binding specificity and internalization. Results Differential expression and spatial specificity analyses identified POR-CAF-001 with high expression in various types of tumor tissues with minimal expression in normal tissues. SPR analysis demonstrated binding affinities (KD) of 1.15 nM and 4.1 nM for POR-CAF-001-01 and POR-CAF-001-02, respectively. Flow cytometry and ICC analyses confirmed robust binding of both antibodies to POR-CAF-001-positive cells, with negligible binding in POR-CAF-001-negative and the target knockout cells. Both antibodies showed substantial internalization in POR-CAF-001-positive cells during the internalization assay, while minimal internalization was observed in the negative cell line. Conclusion Through our target discovery program with ST data, we identified POR-CAF-001 as a novel CAF-specific target protein and developed two human IgG antibodies against it. These antibodies demonstrated high specificity and successful internalization in target-positive cells. These findings provide a solid foundation for further preclinical development, including antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) or other therapeutic modalities targeting POR-CAF-001. Our study underscores the potential of ST in identifying novel targets and advancing cancer therapy.

 This study tests the hypothesis that quantitative profiling of cell type composition and tissue architecture in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas can provide valuable insights into tumor aggressiveness, treatment response, and survival. Towards this goal, we have established a novel method to analyze cell composition and tissue architectural features in IDH mutant gliomas based on multiplex immunohistochemistry staining and automated image analysis.Two independent clinically well-annotated TMAs, derived from approximately 200 patients with IDH1-mutant tumors, are being analyzed. A multiplex fluorescence antibody panel was designed to include markers for astrocytes (GFAP+/IDH1-R132H-), glioma cells (IDH1-R132H+), oligodendrocytes (IDH1-R132H-/SOX10+), leukocytes (CD45+), tumor-associated microglia and macrophages (TAMMs) (IBA1+), endothelial cells (CD34+) and perivascular cells (PDGFRß+). QuPath software was employed for image analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using Python.For cell classification we firstly created single-core “ground truth data” from 20 cores by manual/visual training of core-specific cell classifiers. Second, we created a “multiple-core-trained” classifier by training on 10 of the ground truth cores and testing on the remaining 10 cores. Comparison between ground truth data and “multiple-core-trained” data indicated overall cell classification accuracy of 0.8.A pilot-study of 20 tumors demonstrated that the most abundant cell types were glioma cells, while leukocytes and perivascular cells were the least abundant. The abundance of glioma and perivascular cells showed good consistency between cores from the same patient (corr = 0.8 for both). In contrast, the abundance of oligodendrocytes and leukocyte cells was less consistent (corr = 0.4 and 0.3, respectively).Analyses of spatial pairing of cell types demonstrated strongest positive spatial enrichment between endothelial cells and pericytes and between endothelial cells and TAMMs. In contrast, glioma cells and endothelial cells showed negative spatial enrichment. Notably, inside-case concordance for these “pair-metrics” was high (0.8-0.9).Analyses aiming to identify co-regulated “pair-metrics” revealed strong positive correlations between the three pair-metrics TAMMs/perivascular cells, TAMMs/endothelial cells and endothelial cells/perivascular cells indicating inter-case variability of multi-cellular vascular niches."Cell abundance metrics" and "cell pair metrics" are currently being explored for their associations with clinical characteristics and their potential to enhance prognostic value relative to 1p19q status and WHO grades.

 Intratumor heterogeneity and evolution underlie treatment failures but are poorly understood due to a limited number of tumor biopsies. In this study, we examine IDH mutant gliomas, utilizing a 3D whole tumor sampling approach and exome sequencing (32 patients, 345 samples), along with RNAseq (12 of the 32 patients, 88 samples). We investigate and redefine intratumoral heterogeneity and evolution of insertion/deletion (indel) and single nucleotide variant (SNV) in driver genes on a whole tumor scale.
 In the tumor suppressor capicua transcriptional repressor (CIC), a canonical driver in IDH mutant 1p/19q co-deleted (IDHmut-Codel) tumors, our exome and RNAseq data analysis highlights a wide spectrum of heterogeneity and inactivation by SNVs and indels in independent subclonal expansions. For instance, in nine samples from one patient’s recurrent tumor, five showed distinct CIC SNVs and eight exhibited indels. Notably, all samples showed one or more CIC SNVs or indels. Among five samples harboring SNVs, three had 2 to 3 co-occurring SNVs, and among the 8 samples with indels, three had 2 and one had 5 indels. None had the same combinations of indels and SNVs, indicating extreme heterogeneity and subclonality. Additionally, TA-cloning of a long-range PCR from one sample suggested that each individual SNV and indel were in different tumor cells, raising the possibility of early diversification of subclonal expansions driven by independent CIC alterations. Similar patterns were observed in IDH-mutant and 1p/19q non-codeleted tumors involving tumor suppressor ATRX.
 These findings demonstrate that lower grade IDH-mutant gliomas (LGGs) exhibit significant intratumoral heterogeneity, a trait typically associated with glioblastoma. To determine if CIC alterations were inactivating or simply passengers, we analyzed gene expression in those spatially mapped samples. Within the ETS-domain transcription factor family, ETS1, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 were upregulated in CIC mutant samples versus wild type samples. We also identified novel candidate genes potentially regulated by CIC, suggesting possible mechanisms contributing to tumorigenesis and new treatment targets for IDHmut-Codel tumors.
 This study elucidates the substantial intratumor heterogeneity and evolutionary dynamics in the drivers of LGGs on a whole tumor scale, highlighting their important role in tumorigenesis. By utilizing spatially mapped samples within the same tumors, our research reveals convergence on CIC loss of function through many mutually exclusive SNVs and indels in IDHmut-Codel tumors. Our findings demonstrate the critical nature of CIC inactivation across entire tumors, emphasizing the importance of indels and SNVs in tumor progression. This research also identifies candidate genes upregulated by CIC inactivation as possible treatment targets for IDHmut-Codel tumors.

 Racial disparities in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) outcomes have been reported. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these disparities remain unclear. We integrated imaging mass cytometry and spatial transcriptomics, to characterize the tumor microenvironment (TME) of African American (AA) and European American (EA) patients with TNBC. The TME in AA patients was characterized by interactions between endothelial cells, macrophages, and mesenchymal-like cells, which were associated with poor patient survival. In contrast, the EA TNBC-associated niche is enriched in T-cells and neutrophils suggestive of an exhaustion and suppression of otherwise active T cell responses. Ligand-receptor and pathway analyses of race-associated niches found AA TNBC to be “immune cold” and hence immunotherapy resistant tumors, and EA TNBC as ‘inflamed’ tumors that evolved a distinctive immunosuppressive mechanism. Our study revealed the presence of racially distinct tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive microenvironments in AA and EA patients with TNBC, which may explain the poor clinical outcomes.
 Statement of Significance We have uncovered distinct tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive microenvironments that may contribute to the observed disparities in patient outcomes. Our findings lay the groundwork for developing race-specific therapeutic interventions, potentially improving outcomes for patients with TNBC. Given that chemotherapy and anti-PD1 therapy are currently available treatments for TNBC, our finding of race-specific spatial multicellular niche-associated cell-cell interactions suggest that these treatments may have racially distinct response profiles among TNBC patients. Hence, our novel insights on molecular and cellular interactions in TNBC stratified by race has the potential to inform personalized treatment strategies.

 Little is known about how interactions between the uveal melanoma (UM) and host cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) drive the progression of liver metastases. Single cell RNA-seq analysis of UM samples identified marked differences in cell-cell communication between primary and metastatic UM characterized by increased signaling strength and numbers of interactions emanating from the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and endothelial cells in the metastatic samples. In co-culture, HSCs modulated the transcriptional heterogeneity of the UM cells, enriching for cell states that expressed genes implicated in cell survival, metabolic reprogramming and the angiogenic response. Co-culture of HSCs and UM cells also led to increased expression of growth factors and receptors implicated in angiogenesis including IL-8, VCAM1, VEGF and ICAM1. One candidate driver of HSC reprogramming was the TGF-beta family member GDF15. Increased expression of GDF15 was associated with a Class 2 metastatic UM phenotype in clinical UM samples and UM cell lines, with silencing of BAP1 in UM cells increasing both GDF15 expression and H3K27ac marks at the GDF15 promoter. Treatment of HSCs with GDF15 led to increased expression of multiple ECM proteins, inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors, including IL- 8. Both exogenous GDF15, IL-8 and conditioned media from UM-HSC co-cultures increased endothelial cell network formation in vitro, an effect that could be blocked by anti-GDF15 antibodies. In an eye->liver metastasis model of UM, silencing of GDF15 did not prevent the seeding of UM cells to the liver, but did inhibit the outgrowth of metastatic lesions. Although the GDF15-silenced UM cells were proliferative they did not recruit endothelial cells, leading to a significant reduction in metastatic burden. In sum, we provide the first evidence that UM liver metastasis development is dependent upon GDF15-mediated remodeling of the liver microenvironment leading to an angiogenic response that supports tumor growth.

        <tr id="Transcription factors play a central role in cancer growth, progression, and metastasis, and contribute to intratumor phenotypic plasticity which enable drug tolerance and cancer relapse. Changes in the regulatory activities of transcription factors in cancer may not always be detected by investigating mutational signatures or differential expression of the transcription factor, as done in traditional analysis. In addition, past studies have focused on the activities of transcription factors in tumors as a whole and thus, have not fully captured the heterogeneity in gene regulation among different cell types within the tumor microenvironment. In this work, through an analysis of the transitions in regulatory network architecture and gene regulation dynamics, we identify the central transcription factors associated with lung adenocarcinoma progression. The gene NR2F1, associated with neurodevelopment and cancer dormancy, emerge as a key transcription factor in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma. We further identify transcription factors that are only active in cancer samples and uncover how changes in gene regulation dynamics influence intratumor heterogeneity. Taken together, our work elucidates the transitions in gene regulatory network during cancer progression, identifies central transcription factors in this process, and reveals the complex regulatory changes cooccurring in different cell types within the tumor microenvironment.">

 Intra-tumor heterogeneity plays a crucial role in tumor evolution and response to therapy, highlighting the need to understand mutation clonality and subclonal architecture to drive advancements in precision cancer treatments. However, existing tools for subclonal reconstruction are typically too slow for large cohort analyses, and lack an accessible web-based interface for widespread use.



 We developed CliPP-on-Web, an interactive platform built with R Shiny, to streamline subclonal analysis for researchers and clinicians. Its back-end algorithm is based on model-based clustering with regularized maximum likelihood estimation, derived from the core methodology of CliPP. This algorithm models variant allele counts using a binomial distribution, incorporating tumor purity, copy number alterations (CNAs), and cancer cell fractions (CCFs) of somatic mutations. By penalizing pairwise differences in CCFs, it effectively clusters mutations without requiring predefined subclone numbers. Optimization is achieved through the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), ensuring high computational efficiency.



 CliPP-on-Web simplifies subclonal analysis by enabling users to process up to 10 samples simultaneously with user-uploaded. Interactive visualization tools, such as Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) and Cellular Prevalence (CP) plots, offer features like zooming, hover details, and adjustable smoothing for enhanced clarity. Pre-loaded integrated datasets from TCGA and PCAWG enable comparative studies, while the Driver Mutation module highlights key cancer mutations with searchable and downloadable results. Capable of processing 100 samples in just30 minutes — far outpacing the ∼3 hours per sample required by tools like PhyloWGS — CliPP-on-Web provides efficient and comprehensive subclonal analysis, advancing cancer genomics research.



 CliPP-on-Web offers a powerful, accessible platform for analyzing mutation clonality and subclonal architecture across diverse tumor types, facilitating both large-scale studies and individual sample exploration.

 Intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) refers to the presence of diverse cell populations within a single tumor, each with distinct genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic characteristics. This complexity presents significant challenges in treatment, as different subpopulations may respond variably to therapies, yet the non-genetic component of ITH and its contribution to treatment response remains poorly understood. We mapped transcriptomic and epigenomic ITH to explore evolution of non-genetic ITH in response to therapy in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).



 The SCANDARE study (NCT03017573) included patients with HGSOC that are treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Biopsies were performed at baseline, after NAC surgery and at recurrence for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq, n=17 samples, 111,946 with 1,773 median gene coverage), single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq, n=35 samples, 151,719 nuclei with 2,843 median gene coverage), and single-cell epigenomics (snCUT&Tag, n=24 samples, 58,892 nuclei with 1,409 unique fragments median coverage). Our snCUT&Tag dataset is one of the first single-cell epigenomic map of cancer patients under treatment, focusing on the histone modification H3K4me1, which accumulates at primed and active enhancers and promoters. We integrated these clinically annotated single-cell/nuclei datasets with publicly available scRNA-seq data of HGSOC.



 We constructed a consensus map of functional tumor states in HGSOC, based on scRNA-seq analysis of over 200,000 tumor cells. This analysis revealed 15 recurrent tumor cell phenotypes, ranging from stressed to cycling or inflammatory states. We identified the transcription factors and cell-cell communications specific to each tumor cell state. These tumor states are encoded at the epigenomic level, we could identify in each tumor epigenetic clones - clusters of cells with the same epigenome - each displaying a H3K4me1 landscape characteristic of one tumor state. These results show that tumor states correspond to tumor populations with distinct non-genetic features. Longitudinal sampling by snRNA-seq further showed that tumor state composition consistently evolves upon chemotherapy exposure in patients: tumors lose their cycling, hypoxic and interferon cells while gaining cells with partial mesenchymal and inflammatory characteristics.



 We propose a consensus map of transcriptomic and epigenomic tumor states in HGSOC. Our work is a proof of concept that we can monitor functional ITH with high resolution snRNA-seq from frozen biopsies of the standard of care. We show that these consensus tumor states consistently evolve upon treatment in all patients, pinpointing tumor cell states that are not successfully targeted by NAC, that would need to be targeted by adjuvant therapies.

 Head and neck cancers are the 7th most common cancer type globally accounting for over 900, 000 cases annually. With increasing numbers of systemic and targeted therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), it has become increasingly important to understand the complex tumour microenvironment (TME) milieu dictating clinical responses to therapy. In this study, we profiled 40 whole slide, head and neck cancer tissues from patients prior to ICI therapy and profiled the TME for spatial interactions using the NaveniPlex in situ proximity ligation assay (isPLA, Navinci ). Using the Leica BOND RX, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections were prepared by baking, deparaffinization, and epitope unmasking. Staining was then carried out using the NaveniPlex isPLA technology on the Leica BOND RX instrument. To assess interactions between PD1/PD-L1, CD8/MHCI, and CD3+ T cells, three pairs of Navenibodies were employed simultaneously. Briefly, the NaveniPlex isPLA protocol involves tissue blocking, followed by incubation with primary Navenibodies, ligation, and rolling circle amplification (RCA). Each Navenibody pair generates a distinct RCA product. The RCA products for PD1/PD-L1, CD8/MHCI, and CD3+ T cells were visualized using oligonucleotides conjugated to Atto647N, Atto550, and AlexaFluor488, respectively.Our spatial interaction analysis for PD1/PDL1, CD8/MHCI and CD3+ T-cells showed distinct TME interactions associated with responders and non-responders to ICI therapy. Interactions mapped with cellular phenotypes revealed the cellular neighbourhoods and communities at which these interactions may be useful prognostically. Taken together, this study provides a methodological framework to profile pre-ICI treatment tissues to identify spatial interactions associated with clinical endpoints.

 Glioblastoma (GBM) is a treatment resistant brain tumor with a median survival post-diagnosis of only 18-20 months. One significant limitation in the development of effective therapeutics for GBM is the lack of suitable pre-clinical models that accurately replicate human GBM and the surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME) cell interactions. Tumor Associated Microglia and Myeloid-derived Macrophages, collectively TAMs, are of particular interest due to their essential role in tumor immunosuppression. We have adapted Stem Pharm’s neural organoid technology by incorporating GBM cell lines and PDX models to develop a GBM organoid model which enables interrogation of these complex, multicellular interactions within a 3D tumor organoid. Stem Pharm’s cerebral organoids contain neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia and leverage our proprietary synthetic hydrogel matrix to form highly reproducible organoids in a 96 well plate format. We have previously applied these organoids as a general model of neuroinflammation and developmental neurotoxicity. Microglia integrated into Stem Pharm’s neural organoids exhibit appropriate gene signatures, ramified morphology, tile, and are uniformly distributed throughout the organoid. Here we demonstrate that GBM cells integrate into and proliferate within the neural organoids and activate tumor associated microglia to an immunosuppressive phenotype. Using single cell RNA Sequencing (10X Genomics) we have characterized microglia gene expression in our model in the presence or absence of integrated GBM cells. We find microglia form distinct clusters based on the presence or absence of GBM cells in the organoids. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of microglia between GBM and control organoids were used for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Gene sets related to migration, response to growth factors, and oxygen levels were upregulated in microglia exposed to GBM cells while sets related to inflammatory responses, cytokine production, and antigen presentation were downregulated, consistent with an anti-inflammatory, tumor-supportive microglia phenotype found within glioblastoma. This model will be useful to explore cellular interactions and modulation of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of GBM in pursuit of improved therapeutics.

 Gliomas account for over 80% of primary malignant brain tumors. Among the most aggressive of these is IDH-wildtype high-grade glioma (HGG), known as glioblastoma, which is resistant to treatment and carries a median survival of 15 months. Genomic and transcriptomic characterization of HGG demonstrate strong inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Distinct from IDH-mutant glioma which notably exhibit diffuse infiltrative histology with hypermethylated molecular phenotype, IDH-wildtype HGG circumferentially organize around a necrotic core with aggressive tumor expansion and macrovascular proliferation. Both IDH mutation status and tumor grade are significant prognostic factors. While IDH inhibitors have had success in IDH-mutant low-grade glioma (LGG), prognosis remains poor for HGG regardless of IDH status. Hence, a comprehensive multi-omic and spatial dataset spanning IDH status and tumor grades is crucial to further delineate similarity and heterogeneity along the disease course. In this study, we present a cohort of 85 specimens from 68 patients with high- and low-grade glioma, as well as comparisons with metastases and normal brain. To comprehensively investigate the epigenetic programs and spatial architecture of glioma driven by IDH status and tumor grade, we performed multiome single-nucleus sequencing, Xenium spatial in-situ gene expression assay, whole exome sequencing and pathological reviews. Concurrent snATAC and snRNA, in the same cell, identified differential epigenetic programs and downstream transcriptional changes. Global ATAC and RNA similarity shows IDH-mutant tumors, regardless of grade, are most closely related to oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs) whereas IDH-wildtype tumors show similarity to neurons, astrocytes and OPCs. To understand the spatial context differences between these tumors, we performed Xenium in-situ gene expression assays on 9 IDH-wildtype and 8 IDH-mutant HGG samples. We observe not only an increased density of OPCs in IDH-mutant HGG, but also a distinct tumor niche organized around OPCs that is more frequently observed in IDH-mutant tumors. This niche demonstrated upregulation of neurogenesis pathways and reduced hypoxia signature compared to tumor cells spatially discontiguous from OPC communities. Taken together, multimodal assessment of single-cell epigenetics, transcriptomic trajectory, and spatial organization provide further insight on glioma pathogenesis.

 Over 50% of melanomas are driven by BRAFV600 mutations. Clinically, targeted inhibitors of mutant BRAF and MEK are the primary treatment for more than 50% of melanoma patients that are refractory to standard-of-care immunotherapy. While targeted therapies are initially clinically effective, a subset of residual cancer cells persist and inevitably drive tumor recurrence and drug resistance. While some cells persist due to pre-existing mechanisms (e.g. genetic mutations), others can non-genetically adapt to tolerate drug by rewiring their internal signaling cascades. Importantly, a key feature of these non-genetically adapted persister cells is that their drug-tolerant phenotype is acquired in response to drug pressure, making them extremely challenging to identify and characterize.
 Using cutting-edge long-term time-lapse microscopy and an automated single-cell tracking pipeline, we studied the behaviors of persister cells in drug-treated BRAFV600E melanoma populations. Notably, we found significant heterogeneity within persister populations. While all persister cells initially enter a state of drug-induced quiescence, a subset of these cells—termed “escapees”—can escape drug action and resume proliferation. By computationally reconstructing single-cell lineages from long-term time-lapse imaging experiments, we monitored key signaling pathways before, during, and after escape from drug. Using this approach, we identified a significant increase in mTorC1 signaling activity in persisters that would go on to escape drug. Additionally, mTorC1 signaling caused increases in protein translation and cell growth rates during the quiescent periods of these cells.
 The abundance of Cyclin D1, a key driver of proliferation, is extremely sensitive to cellular translation rates due to its short half-life. In order to determine if the observed increase in mTorC1-mediated growth and translation is driving the upregulation of Cyclin D1 levels past a threshold necessary for escape, we used CRISPR to tag Cyclin D1 at the endogenous locus. Importantly, we found that escapees significantly upregulate Cyclin D1 levels in the hours prior to their escape, compared to non-escapees. These findings have important clinical implications because they suggest that Cyclin D1 protein levels are a key bottleneck for cell-cycle re-entry under MAPK inhibition. Additionally, these findings implicate Cyclin D1 as one of the first markers that can distinguish future escapees from non-escapees in the quiescence period before these distinct cell-cycle fates emerge.

        <tr id="Tumors exhibit highly heterogeneous genomic and transcriptomic landscapes. Characterization of this intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and its implications for the cancer therapies has been one of the focal points of computational cancer biology in the past years. However, while ITH at the level of genomic changes, such as copy number aberrations, has been well characterized, the downstream impact of ITH on the gene regulatory landscape remains underexplored. Disruptions in gene regulatory programs can lead to emergence of more aggressive or drugresistant tumor clones. In order to better understand whether the evidence for ITH at the gene regulatory level can be inferred from scRNA-seq data we have conducted a series of experiments that explore the levels of gene regulatory network (GRN) discrepancies between the clonal sub-populations of tumor cells. In particular, we quantify the extent to which GRNs inferred from different tumor clones diverge from each other in three settings: triple negative breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and a longitudinal dataset from a patient undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. Our analyses indicate that a substantial (15-25%) proportion of GRN edges can be attributed to clone-specific activity. Furthermore, we observe differential network patterns across outlier transcription factors implicated in tumorogenesis and tumor progression. Our findings suggest that differential network patterns between clonal subpopulations can be reliably identified, and that such patterns offer a complementary insight that is not captured by differential gene analyses.">

 Early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) is increasing yet the mechanism for the accelerated shift to a younger age is unknown. We hypothesize that sporadic gene mutations that are necessary for colon carcinogenesis but not sufficient to cause cancer, create a preneoplastic cell state for increased risk of transformation. To identify transitional cell phenotypes, we used Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) on distal colon samples from Car1-Cre (CAC) mice with Cre expression limited to ∼6% of the distal colon/rectum epithelium, where EOCRC is more prevalent. CAC;ROSAmT/mG (CR) mice (where eGFP marks cells expressing Cre) were crossed to those with floxed oncogene alleles to generate mice with one (Apc+/-, ACR) or two (Apc+/-;KrasG12D/wt, AKCR) non-transforming mutations. ACR mice had normal crypt morphology and low adenoma incidence (<5% of mice), while 4-week-old AKCR mice exhibited crypt elongation, and 8-10 wk-old AKCR developed 3-8 advanced adenomas/mouse. Distal colon Swiss rolls (n=9) and tumors (n=3) with phenotypes ranging from normal to malignant were collected and processed using the 10X Visium Spatial Gene Expression System. Sequencing data was processed, and sample data were pooled for analysis using Seurat. Spatial counts were normalized, dimensionality was reduced with PCA, then clustered and visualized as UMAP projections. Clusters were annotated to known cell types, and differential gene expression (DEG) analysis was followed by functional annotation using GO and Pathway terms. In normal tissue, clusters for the crypt base, middle, and top were identified. These spatially restricted clusters were replaced in early AKCR crypts and again in late AKCR crypts. The clusters from late AKCR crypts were distinct from those in ACR tumors, which were different from clusters in AKCR tumors. This indicates the existence of transition states from normal to “not normal, not cancer” to early adenoma to late adenoma. Normal epithelial clusters were enriched for genes controlling typical colonic functions, e.g. metabolism, and transmembrane transport pathways. AKCR crypt clusters lost these functions and gained others, e.g. immune and antimicrobial genes normally associated with Paneth cells (e.g., Defa22, Defa24, Defa30), gene markers associated with CRC tumors (e.g. Egfr, Hamp, Plet1, Wfdc18), genes for xenobiotic inactivation (Maoa, various Cyp, Gst, Ugt, and Sult genes). Compared to late AKCR crypts, AKCR tumor clusters lost even more colonic functions (e.g. downregulation of differentiation marker Krt20 and xenobiotic metabolism markers) and expressed genes related to mitosis, DNA replication, and DNA repair, highlighting a transition to uncontrolled proliferation and genomic instability. Our findings delineate key early molecular transitions in epithelial cells during colon carcinogenesis that may increase the risk of transformation.

This review summarizes recent studies in understanding tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) biology, highlighting CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) as pivotal regulators of immune surveillance and suppression. We summarize emerging biomarkers such as TCR clonality, spatial distribution of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and exhaustion markers including PD-1, TCF1, and TIM-3, which predict immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy beyond PD-L1 expression. This review specifically describes radiotherapy-induced immunogenic remodeling and peripheral T cell dynamics as innovative strategies to monitor immune response and resistance mechanisms. By integrating results from single-cell omics and AI-driven spatial analysis, we propose multidimensional frameworks of TIL in NSCLC to overcome resistance and optimize immunotherapy combinations.

Defining the regulatory mechanism and diversity of CAF subtypes could identify potential therapeutic strategies to harness the tumor suppressive activities of CAFs. To address this, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing to profile fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAP) expressing mesenchymal cells in human PDAC. The mesenchymal subpopulations in PDAC reflected mesenchymal cell heterogeneity found in the normal developing pancreas. In addition to characterizing inflammatory CAF (iCAF) and myofibroblastic CAF (myCAF) subpopulations in detail, the analysis uncovered a previously undescribed interferon-response CAF (ifCAF) subtype. Tumor-derived signals induced specific CAF subtypes from pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) in an organoid-based co-culture model, and time-course experiments revealed regulatory mechanisms that govern subtype formation. STING agonists promoted an ifCAF phenotype in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, induction of an ifCAF phenotype suppressed tumor cell invasiveness and induced an anti-tumor phenotype in tumor-associated neutrophils. Together, this study resolves FAP+ stromal cell heterogeneity in PDAC and identifies an ifCAF subtype that can be induced to suppress pro-tumorigenic features of PDAC.">

 Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) represents the world’s most lethal gynecological malignancy and is commonly associated with chemo-resistance and recurrence. Strikingly, up to 70% of EOC patients will relapse where subsequent care becomes palliative. Owing to a lack of model systems and a scarcity of matched treatment-naïve and recurrent clinical samples, few studies have addressed the complex relationship between first-onset EOC and its respective relapse. Identification of in situ tumor phenotypes that resisted initial chemotherapy treatment and initiate recurrent tumors, will allow us to understand which cellular features lead to relapse. This will allow us to better predict tumor recurrence and to ultimately suggest novel therapies. Here we analyze primary and recurrent tumor pairs using highly multiplexed imaging technologies. Through integration of spatial transcriptomics and imaging mass cytometry (IMC), we identify and classify resistance phenotypes in over 320 EOC patients, identifying phenotypes that persist in recurrent tumors. We leverage these technologies to assign novel proteo-transcriptomic resistance modules that allow us to independently observe these phenotypes across multiple single-cell modalities. To uncover phenotype-specific drug sensitivities, we utilized scRNA-seq data to predict in silico drug-response and validated these findings through large-scale image-based ex vivo drug screening. These screens revealed significant multi-drug resistance (MDR) properties of persistent phenotypes, but unveiled sensitivity to alternate FDA-approved drug classes. Together, our work represents the first-of-its-kind high-dimensional map of resistant and recurrent EOC, offering tangible therapeutic solutions for the treatment and prevention of recurrence.

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a significant health burden due to tumor heterogeneity and treatment resistance, emphasizing the need for improved biological understanding and tailored therapies. In this study, we enrolled 31 HNSCC patients for the establishment of patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs), which faithfully maintained the genomic features and histopathological traits of the primary tumors. Long-term culture preserved key characteristics, affirming PDOs as robust representative models. PDOs demonstrated predictive capability for cisplatin treatment responses, with ex vivo drug sensitivity correlating with patient outcomes. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing unveiled molecular subtypes and intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in PDOs, paralleling patient tumors. Notably, a hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal transition (hEMT)-like ITH program was associated with cisplatin resistance and poor patient survival. Functional analyses identified amphiregulin (AREG) as a potential regulator of the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal state. Moreover, AREG contributed to cisplatin resistance via EGFR pathway activation, corroborated by clinical samples. In summary, HNSCC PDOs serve as reliable and versatile models, offer predictive insights into ITH programs and treatment responses, and uncover potential therapeutic targets for personalized medicine.">

In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified adult-type diffuse gliomas into three distinct categories: astrocytomas (isocitrate dehydrogenase [IDH]-mutated), oligodendrogliomas (IDH-mutated and 1p/19q-deleted), and glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype (GBM). GBM is the most common and aggressive primary malignant tumor of the Central Nervous System (CNS), characterized by its high recurrence rate and rapid growth. Dysregulation of HOX genes is a well-established phenomenon in both solid and liquid malignancies, playing crucial roles in various fundamental characteristics of cancer, including GBM. In recent years, HOX genes have gained recognition not only as key regulators of tumor progression but also as potential biomarkers for predicting disease outcomes and as promising therapeutic targets for GBM. This review compiles the latest research on HOX genes in GBM, encompassing studies published before and after the 2021 WHO classification of CNS tumors. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of key findings on the role of HOX gene clusters, which are groups of genes involved in regulating the development of the body plan along the anterior–posterior axis, in GBM initiation, progression, prognosis, and treatment response.

        <tr id="Adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) are commonly detected endocrine lesions, identified during imaging for unrelated conditions. These lesions exhibit considerable heterogeneity and diverse clinical outcomes. This study employed single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate tumorigenic characteristics of AIs, including non-functional adrenocortical adenomas, Conn's syndrome, and pheochromocytomas. Through integrating public datasets, 302 696 cells are analyzed. Three adrenocortical cell subtypes exhibit gene expression patterns linked to tumorigenesis. Clusterin emerges as a potential biomarker for adrenocortical adenomas. Adrenocortical tumor cells show dysregulated hormone secretion and transcription factor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) is significantly upregulated, distinguishing cortical from medullary tumors. In pheochromocytomas, a MYCN proto-oncogene (MYCN)-positive cluster correlates with poorer survival. Immune microenvironment analysis reveals specific immune subtypes and roles in tumor progression. Specifically, myeloid cells may regulate benign tumors, while lymphoid cells, such as CD8-positive (CD8+) T cells, appear to promote immune activation and infiltration in malignant tumors. Overall, this study enhances the understanding of adrenal adenoma heterogeneity, revealing crucial transcriptional profiles, immune interactions, and clinically relevant candidate biomarkers.">

 Patient derived xenografts (PDX) are important preclinical models of cancer as they faithfully recapitulate many aspects of human tumors. Currently, models derived from patients of non-European genetic ancestry are underrepresented, limiting the potential of precision medicine advancements to equitably improve patient outcomes. The United for Health Equity Living PDX Program (U4HELPP) seeks to address this need by generating new PDX models representative of the diverse population served by the VCU Health System. This study aims to 1) characterize the histologic, genomic, and transcriptomic features of a new cohort of ancestrally diverse PDX models of breast, pancreatic, colon, and lung cancer, and 2) identify drug sensitivities and response markers that will be targeted in ongoing studies utilizing these models.



 Tumor fragments were implanted in the bilateral mammary glands or subcutaneous flank of NSG mice, and growth rates were defined. Tissue was fixed and embedded for histological staining to identify the cancer type and subtype. Whole genome and bulk RNA sequencing were performed to assess the mutational profile, genetic ancestry, and global transcriptomic landscape. Single cell RNA sequencing was utilized to capture the transcriptomic heterogeneity within each model. Finally, high throughput drug screening with the NCI NExT Oncology Interrogation Tools Set of 555 agents was performed in vitro to assess the drug sensitivities of each PDX.



 Whole genome sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing positively identified distinct genetic ancestries within the cohort. Histopathologic analysis revealed a rare metaplastic breast carcinoma, and immunohistochemical staining stratified breast cancer models into estrogen receptor positive and triple negative subtypes. Bulk RNA sequencing was used to subtype pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models as basal-like, classical, or intermediate, and single-cell RNA sequencing confirmed the presence of mixed subtype populations within these samples. High throughput drug screening identified sensitivities that correlated with mutations detected through whole genome sequencing; overall, several classes of drugs including proteasome and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors were found to be highly cytotoxic in all cancer types tested.



 This study integrates multiple modalities to characterize the histological features, molecular signatures, and cellular heterogeneity of this new cohort of PDXs, which will provide researchers with extensive data on which to base future studies utilizing these models. Furthermore, it identifies promising therapeutic agents and explores genomic markers of drug sensitivity which could be used to predict patient response to novel treatments.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor originating from glial cells and presents difficulty in treatment. GBM are highly heterogeneous, presenting a challenge in treatment. In addition, cells migrate away often as single cells from primary tumor sites making GBM impossible to be fully resected. GBM cells adapt their behavior based on the mechanical properties of their surrounding microenvironment, making it significant to investigate gene markers associated with these mechanical changes. Our recent efforts to investigate particular gene markers included using an interface hydrogel platform that replicates the local microenvironment from the tumor edge to peritumoral tissue. Using this model we successfully separated migratory and non-migratory cells. Results from single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing identified gene targets that were overexpressed within the migratory group. We found the gene PTPRN2, which plays a role in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis, was overexpressed in migratory cells. This could be a promising target for future therapeutic methods to limit glioblastoma cell migration. In addition to PTPRN2, we are exploring the role of MT1X, a gene in the metallothionein family, to validate these findings. We are currently investigating the expression of the PTPRN2 and MT1X genes using GBM xenograft mouse models. We have observed PTPRN2 expression in the GBM mouse models, with the highest expression detected in migratory cells compared to non-migratory cells in soft gel conditions. In the future, we plan to perform western blot analysis to further confirm PTPRN2 and MT1X protein expression and validate their roles as potential target proteins for GBM treatment.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, with rectal cancer (RC) accounting for one-third of cases. Only 20% of RC patients have a complete response to chemoradiation therapy (CRT) and may be able to avoid surgery, therefore, therapeutic resistance remains a major barrier to improving outcomes. The genetic and cellular heterogeneity of RC, particularly in treatment-resistant sub-clones, suggests that this diversity could be a harbinger of adverse outcomes. A detailed characterization of treatment responses at the subclonal level is critical to advancing targeted therapeutic strategies.



 Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and single-cell RNA sequencing were employed to investigate the cellular and molecular landscape of RC tumors. Two PDX models were established from the primary tumors of pre-treatment RC patients. Mice bearing tumors were subjected to a standard CRT regimen, consisting of 2 Gy daily radiation and 100mg/kg capecitabine daily for two weeks, followed by a week-long rest period. Tumor tissues were collected at baseline and at various post-treatment intervals for sequencing.



 Our scRNA-seq analysis of one PDX model identified five distinct tumor clusters with varying responses to treatment. Two clusters demonstrated initial sensitivity to CRT, followed by a resurgence, indicating potential therapy resistance. Pathway analysis revealed cluster-specific activation of critical oncogenic pathways, including HIF-1, p53, and FoxO signaling pathways. These pathways are implicated in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance, and the associated marker genes present potential targets for intervention. Lineage tracing of tumor cells uncovered two differentiation trajectories, with one showing increased resistance. Cell-cell communication analysis highlighted extensive interactions among tumor sub-populations, particularly mediated by CLDN3-CLDN3 adhesion, which may contribute to therapeutic resistance. Additionally, our investigation into copy number variations identified alterations in the chr6p21.31-p21.1 region, which harbors several oncogenes with copy number changes directly implicated in tumor progression. In the second PDX model, scRNA-seq identified two therapy-resistant tumor clusters among five detected clusters. The resistant tumor clusters exhibited enrichment of HIF-1, Hippo, and p53 signaling pathways, similar to the first PDX model but also unique activation of pathways like TGF-β and Hippo signaling.



 Our study highlights the dynamic, heterogeneity of RC tumors to CRT, identifying both shared and patient-specific resistance mechanisms in two PDX models. These findings underscore the complexity of RC tumor biology and offer a foundation for developing precision therapies targeting treatment-resistant subclones.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) has been classified into molecular subtypes using gene-level data from both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), leading to the development of the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) and intrinsic CMS (iCMS). In addition to CRC studies, scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics characterization of human polyps, aligned with the conventional adenoma and serrated polyps, identified distinct driver mutations, cells-of-origin and iCMS traits associated with each polyp type. These gene-level transcriptional classification approaches were both strongly aligned to mutations underpinning the Vogelstein model of CRC development.
 However, when viewed using pathway-level information, the most dominant mechanistic signaling cascades in CRC were completely independent of these same mutational drivers. Therefore, to deliver a holistic landscape-view of the tumor ecosystem, we proposed that pathway-level subtyping could offer a broader understanding of non-genetic phenotypic signaling in CRC, leading to more informative stratification and therapeutic decision-making.
 Using this new approach in combination with bulk transcriptional data from n=1200+ tumors, alongside n=29, 452 scRNA-seq profiles derived from murine organoids, and n=49, 155 epithelial cells derived from n=63 human tumor samples, we identified three pathway-derived subtypes (PDS1-3), revealing previously overlooked changes in epithelial cell identities and phenotypic states. PDS2 represents tumors with stroma/immune-dense, regenerative stem-like features. PDS1 were associated with elevated MYC signaling, proliferation and canonical stem-cells with good prognosis, while PDS3 displayed a differentiated-like phenotype associated with reduced polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC)-mediated gene repression and poorer prognosis.
 The inverse relationship between MYC/PRC targets within PDS1/PDS3 tumors supported the development of stem maturation index, which was directly related to cellular entropy and differentiation status of colonic cells allowing our tumor data to be projected onto a Waddington’s landscape. Given these associations with developmental patterns in established tumors, we next utilized the same pathway-level approach in combination with transcriptional data derived from n=2641 human polyps, where we observe that PDS traits can be established early in precancer development. Using a combination of trajectory analyzes, lineage identities and cellular phenotyping, these approaches have again revealed that, even in very early precancers, there is no association between Vogelstein-related mutational drivers and prominent phenotypic signaling cascades.
 While work is ongoing, the use of pathway-level information provides a unique insight into the dynamic nature of phenotypic evolution across early-to-late stages of colorectal precancers and tumors.

 The development of chemoresistance in many cancer patients poses a significant clinical challenge, while the underlying causes for heterogeneous drug responses remain largely elusive. Increasing evidence suggests that tumors exhibit extensive heterogeneity and harbor cancer subpopulations in less differentiated states that are linked to treatment resistance. Therefore, dissecting immature cancer cell states pre-existing in tumors is essential for identifying biomarkers associated with chemoresistance and establishing targeted therapeutic strategies, particularly in breast cancer, where specific biomarkers are largely lacking.



 We utilized CytoTRACE, a robust computational framework for predicting the cellular differentiation status from single-cell RNA sequencing data, to unveil the immature cancer cell state and its associated markers in single-cell atlases of human breast cancer. The association between the identified immature cell state and patient survival was determined by inferring the proportions of epithelial cancer cells expressing the marker gene in bulk gene expression datasets. The MMTV-PyMT mouse breast cancer model was used to experimentally investigate the role of the immature cancer cell state in conferring chemoresistance. Single-cell profiling was conducted on tumor samples before and after treatment to examine the inherent characteristics of immature cancer cells and their response to drug pressure. The results obtained from mouse tumors were subsequently confirmed using human breast cancer models.



 We revealed that BCL11B, a zinc finger transcription factor, defines a distinct immature cancer cell state in human breast cancer that displays basal cell features and demonstrates a heterogeneous expression pattern across breast tumors. Breast cancer patients with higher levels of BCL11B+ cancer cells face a significantly increased risk of relapse following chemotherapy. This pre-existing tumor subpopulation exhibits intrinsic fitness advantages and demonstrates a remarkable ability to evolve into a drug-resistant state through various BCL11B-dependent pre-existing and transcriptional adaptation mechanisms. Notably, TNF-α was pinpointed as a natural inhibitor of BCL11B, and treatment with TNF-α significantly increases chemotherapy efficacy by inducing the exit of the drug-resistant cell state. In conclusion, our findings identify BCL11B as a valuable biomarker for predicting chemotherapy resistance and suggest TNF-α combination treatment for breast cancer patients at high risk of developing chemoresistance.

 Breast cancer, characterized by considerable heterogeneity, showcases genetic and epigenetic variability among individual tumors and their constituent cells. Notably, this intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) can drive clonal evolution and therapy resistance, particularly in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancers. Despite the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapies, many patients develop resistance, resulting in poor prognosis. This study aims to elucidate the dynamic interplay between genetic alterations and epigenetic modifications during anti-HER2 therapy using advanced single-cell resolution techniques. Biopsy samples were collected at three time points from patients undergoing neoadjuvant HER2-targeted therapy as part of the TRIO-US B07 clinical trial. Utilizing methods such as low-pass whole-genome sequencing (WGS, n=47), single-nuclei WGS (snWGS, n=21), and matched single-nuclei RNA/ATAC-seq (n=22), we explored copy-number variations (CNVs), subclonal tumor dynamics, and alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We also analyzed additional deep WGS (n= 205) to reconstruct the structure of HER2 amplicons. Our analysis revealed distinct CNV dynamics in HER2-positive breast cancers during treatment. We found that while broad-level CNVs remained stable, focal amplifications exhibited temporal variability, suggesting the presence of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Specifically, the structure of HER2 amplificons emerged as a pivotal determinant of aggressiveness, with higher numbers of co-amplified oncogenes correlating with non-pathological complete response (pCR) and metastasis. Single-cell resolution analyses unraveled significant subclonal diversity in a subset of patients exhibiting complex tumor architectures. Integration of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling highlighted that pCR patients exhibited higher lymphocyte infiltration and dynamic immune shifts post-treatment. Conversely, non-pCR tumors displayed increased regulatory T cells. Furthermore, fibroblast state transitions characterized by altered extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression suggested a potential role in modulating immune responses. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic and epigenetic factors driving therapy resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer. We emphasize the importance of longitudinal, multimodal profiling to refine patient stratification and inform personalized treatment strategies. Overall, this study offers new avenues for understanding tumor evolution in response to therapy and highlights the need for comprehensive assessments of ITH and microenvironmental dynamics for improved clinical outcomes.

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 is crucial in treating breast cancer. Despite clinical success, the mechanisms by which ICB therapies reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME) and enhance anti-tumor activity remain unclear. Recent studies reveal that anti-PD-1 therapies broadly alter TME cells beyond PD-1+ T cells, highlighting extensive cell-cell communication (CCC) as a key factor. Understanding CCC changes in response to anti-PD-1 therapy can illuminate its mechanisms of action (MOA) and TME dynamics. This study applies causal inference methodology to investigate CCC between T cells and non-T cells in the TME of breast cancer patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy.
 Methods:
 We analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data from 31 breast cancer patients pre- and on-treatment with anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab) reported by Bassez et al., 2021. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across cell types. We applied the instrumental variable method to identify causal relationships between signals in T-cell and non-T-cell DEGs to uncover treatment-induced CCC. We further searched for ligand-receptor pairs mediating CCC and identified gene expression modules (GEMs) regulated by these ligand-receptors. Finally, we constructed a CCC network from T to non-T cells.
 Results:
 Anti-PD1 treatment induced broad gene expression changes in diverse cell populations. Major T cell pathways influenced by anti-PD-1 therapy include NF-κB, interferon-γ and interleukins. CD4
 +
 and CD8
 +
 exhausted cells, expressing high levels of
 PDCD1
 (encoding PD-1), exhibited distinct activated pathways. We identified the CCC network from T cells to non-T cells via ligand-receptor interactions. For example, anti-PD1 treatment activated cellular stress, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways in T cells, altering the expression of a GEM that included
 TSC22D3
 and
 TXNIP
 . This initiated signaling to myeloid cells via
 RPS19
 -

 , leading to NF-κB activation. CD4+ exhausted T cells primarily signaled to monocytes, enhancing helper functions to recruit and activate monocytes, thereby promoting immune regulation and amplification. In contrast, CD8+ exhausted T cells primarily interacted with macrophages, intensifying cytotoxic responses that facilitated effective tumor-cell killing.
 Conclusions:
 Our analyses provide insights into the dynamic interplay of cells within the TMEs during anti-PD-1 therapy. These findings could facilitate the identification of new biomarkers for predicting heterogeneous treatment responses to anti-PD-1 regimens, potentially enhancing the design and customization of immunotherapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients. Finally, this study demonstrated the utility of causal inference methodologies for mechanistic studies of CCC.

 The complexity and heterogeneity of cancers both intra- and inter-patient have led to the precision medicine paradigm of cancer therapy where treatment is personalized to the individual patient. Recent clinical trials such as the I-PREDICT study [1] have underscored the benefits of approaches matching combination therapies to the patient’s molecular alterations, leading to improved disease control and survival rates. Tumoroids are patient-derived cancer cells that grow as 3D self-organized, multicellular organoids that maintain key characteristics of the patient tumor of origin including molecular features such as genotype and gene expression, and biological behaviors. Whilst these models serve as valuable tools for studying tumor biology and responses of patient-derived cells to various anti-cancer therapies, the establishment and maintenance of tumoroids has historically been difficult and labor intensive, limiting more widespread use. Here, we utilize the Inventia RASTRUMTM platform and OncoProTM colorectal cancer (CRC) Tumoroid Cell Lines (ThermoFisher Scientific [2]) to easily create plug and play patient-derived 3D cell models based on synthetic PEG-based hydrogel matrices, which were tuned to mimic the tissue stiffness and ECM composition of CRC tumors. We used this workflow to evaluate how these 3D models maintain the clinicopathological features of patient-derived tumoroid cells, as well as molecular features and cellular signaling native to the tumor and its microenvironment. We further demonstrate the utility of this approach for throughput drug screening and predicting personalized therapy responses. Overall, our approach provides a scalable framework for evaluating precision medicine approaches using clinically-relevant patient-derived tumoroids. Future work will focus on the development of processes to support direct dissociation and generation of patient-derived models from biopsies from a variety of cancer types and larger scale utility of the RASTRUM platform in workflows that could be leveraged to inform treatment decision making.

        <tr id="Whole-genome doubling (WGD) transforms a diploid cell into a tetraploid state, making it prone to genomic instability, aneuploidy, and malignancy. Tumors with evidence of past WGD events range from less than 10% in Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma to almost 60% in germ cell cancer. WGD confers advantages, including resistance to stressors, making it a powerful macroevolutionary force. Why, then, isn’t WGD a precursor for most cancers? In Glioblastoma (GBM), ∼86% of tumors lack evidence of WGD in their evolutionary history. We integrated a multi-modal dataset of 11 histopathology whole slide images (WSIs), 68 medical images, and whole-genome sequencing data (WGS) from six patient-matched primary and recurrent GBM. Three atlases were derived from FDG PET/MRI (glucose uptake), quantitative BOLD imaging (oxygenation), and magnetic resonance elastography (stiffness), capturing variability across brain regions and patient age. Using HATCHet, which infers clone-specific karyotypes from WGS, we quantified GBM clonal composition and its changes between surgeries. Chromosome 7 amplification and chromosome 10 loss were detected in at least one clone in all tumors. Genetic intra-tumor heterogeneity (coexistence of ≥2 clones) was found in 4/6 patients, with moderate to strong clonal changes between surgeries in all four. This data informed parameters governing how cells of variable (poly)aneuploidy respond to oxygen and glucose by dying (α_d, s_r), switching to glycolysis (O_th), or migrating (v_max). Two parameters significantly differed among patients: oxygen-dependent death constant α_d (ANOVA p = 1.7E-5) and oxygen level prompting a metabolic shift to glycolysis O_th (ANOVA p = 1.9E-4). Higher-ploidy GBMs showed elevated O_th values, and higher-ploidy clones within tumors had consistently higher O_th than coexisting lower-ploidy clones. Between surgeries, simulated tumors with distinct karyotype compositions progressed at different rates. Whether higher ploidy predicted fast recurrence was however a function of the tumor anatomic location, in line with the hypothesis that environments with limited resources are likely to exert selective pressure against WGD. Compared to intra-brain differences in resource supply, the differences observed between organs can be larger, providing an opportunity to further test this hypothesis. Indeed, the average ploidy of 20 different cancer types was positively correlated with the oxygen levels recorded in their respective organ of origin (Spearman r = 0.65, P = 0.002) and negatively correlated to the glucose uptake rates in the organ of origin (Spearman r = -0.70, P = 0.026). Overall, our findings suggest that metabolic substrate availability in the tissue micro-environment influences cell fate decisions based on karyotype, shaping GBM initiation and recurrence.

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cells belong to a diverse collection of cells in different states that are poorly characterized in soft-tissue sarcomas. In this study, we explored tumor growth-regulatory signaling between differentially educated non-malignant mesenchymal stromal cells and malignant cells in pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Methods Xenograft experiments demonstrated that non-malignant stromal cells influence tumor behavior. Gene expression analysis identified deregulated genes, which were further studied using cell culture assays and patient data. Clinicopathological correlations were made in a discovery cohort (N = 147) and a validation cohort (N = 101). Results The results revealed transiently suppressive paracrine effects of orthotopic stromal cells derived from skeletal muscle. These effects were lost when the stromal cells were exposed to RMS cells, either short-term in vitro, or long-term in hindlimb muscle in vivo. High resolution microarray-based Clariom D gene expression analysis identified insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) as the top upregulated gene in RMS cells exposed to naïve stromal cells, and effects on growth arrest, caspase 3/7 activation, and myogenic cell identity were demonstrated in functional assays. Furthermore, IGFBP5 associated with the caspase 3 substrate growth arrest specific protein 2 (GAS2), lower disease stage and favorable survival in patient cohorts. Conclusions This study uses functional modeling and omics approaches to identify IGFBP5 as a candidate mediator of anti-tumor growth mechanisms originating from tumor-neighboring mesenchymal stromal cells. Tumors of mesenchymal origin, such as RMS, are known for their heterogeneity, and this could potentially pose a limitation to the study. However, a clinical relevance is emphasized by consistent findings across patient cohorts. These insights pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies modulating activities of stromal cell subsets at primary and metastatic sites in RMS.

 Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy in women, with rising incidence and mortality. EC is classified into low-grade (I/II), less aggressive, and high-grade (III), associated with poor prognosis and aggressive behavior. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers insights into the interplay between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), improving diagnosis and treatment strategies. This study aims to identify unique cell subtypes and factors distinguishing low-grade from high-grade EC, uncovering therapeutic targets to address tumor progression.



 Tumors from ten treatment-naïve EC patients (four low-grade endometrioid, six high-grade (three endometrioid, three serous), and two age-matched non-malignant endometrial samples were collected at surgery and frozen. Nuclei were isolated from the frozen samples and single-cell libraries prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Kit v3.1 according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Data were analyzed using Seurat v5 in R v4.3.3.



 Multiple phenotypic subsets of EC cells, T cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial, and epithelial cells were identified. Six distinct EC cell subsets were present across tumors, showing significant intratumoral heterogeneity. The MKI67+ EC subcluster predominated in high-grade endometrioid EC, while CHRM2/3+ EC subclusters were exclusive to high-grade serous EC. Both low- and high-grade endometrioid EC exhibited a high proportion of PROM1+ (CD133) cancer stem cells. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes (COL1A2, BNC2, HNF1A-AS1, ITMC2, ZNF492) were upregulated in high-grade EC compared to low-grade, correlating with aggressive phenotypes and poorer prognoses. High-grade EC showed increased activated T cells (PTPN14+), suggesting immune evasion, interestingly, low-grade EC had the highest proportion of exhausted T cells (TIM3+, PD1+) typically associated with aggressive tumors. Consistent macrophage subtypes were observed across EC cells, indicating T-cell-mediated alterations in the TME between EC grades.



 This study provides the first comprehensive comparison of tumor cell diversity and TME components in low- and high-grade EC (endometrioid and serous). These findings, alongside ongoing in vitro studies, aim to uncover viable, subtype-specific therapeutic targets. *Both authors contributed equally

 Quiescent, or G0 cell cycle phase, cells are common in most prostate cancer (PCa) cases, yet are relatively resistant to many treatments, especially cytotoxic chemotherapy. They also play key roles in tumorigenesis, and dormancy and recurrence after curative intent therapy, but are difficult to identify when viable. To identify characteristics of quiescent prostate cancer cells, we used previously published FACS methods to isolate cancer cells from bone or bone marrow of eight metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patient samples and generated single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) gene expression data of individually sorted cells. We also generated scRNA-seq data from six PCa cell lines and two normal (cancer free) bone marrow samples as positive and negative controls for cell identification. We eliminated a priori any potentially contaminating cells based on tSNE cluster location, expression of a 12 gene panel of PCa markers, and lack of expression of bone marrow markers (PTPRC / CD45, and GYPA / CD235a), leaving 297 high confidence PCa cells. To identify characteristics of G0 cells, we separated the patient PCa cells into quiescent and cycling groups based on expression of MKI67 (Ki67). GSEA analysis of KEGG pathways revealed enrichment of primarily immune related pathways in quiescent cells with the top 3 pathways; “allograft rejection, ” “autoimmune thyroid disease, ” and “intestinal immune network for IgA production.” Similarly, for GSEA analysis using gene ontology (GO) groups, “beta-2-microglobulin binding” was the second most enriched group in quiescent cells. Type 1 HLA genes, were common among multiple pathway groups suggesting potential differences in antigen presentation. In subsequent validation experiments, induction of quiescence in LNCaP, C4-2B, PC3, and RM1 PCa cell lines increased cell surface HLA class 1 or Mhc-1. Overall, these results suggest that antigen presentation is increased in quiescent PCa cells, which may be important for their elimination by the immune system, or useful for future immunotherapy approaches.

 Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, yet its regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most metastatic form of lung cancer, with most patients presenting with widespread disease, making it an ideal model for studying metastasis. However, the lack of suitable preclinical models has limited such studies. We utilized well-annotated rapid autopsy-derived tumors to develop xenograft models that mimic key features of SCLC, including histopathology, rapid and widespread development of metastasis to the liver, brain, adrenal, bone marrow, and kidneys within weeks, and response to chemotherapy. By integrating in vivo lineage selection with comprehensive transcriptomic, epigenomic, and single cell multi-omic analyses, we identified critical cellular programs driving metastatic organotropism to the liver and brain, the most common sites of SCLC metastasis. Our findings reveal the key role of nuclear-cytoskeletal interactions in SCLC liver metastasis. Specifically, the loss of the nuclear envelope protein lamin A/C, encoded by the LMNA gene, increased nuclear deformability and significantly increased the incidence of liver metastasis. Human liver metastases exhibited reduced LMNA expression compared to other metastatic sites, correlating with poorer patient outcomes and increased mortality. This study introduces novel preclinical models for SCLC metastasis and highlights pathways critical for organ-specific metastasis, offering new avenues for the development of targeted therapies to prevent or treat metastatic disease.

        <tr id="Isoform switching in cancer is a prevalent phenomenon with significant implications for immunotherapy, as actionable neoantigens derived from these cancer-specific events would be applicable to broad categories of patients, reducing the necessity for personalized treatments. By integrating five large-scale transcriptomic datasets comprising over 19,500 samples across 29 cancer and 54 normal tissue types, we identified cancer-associated isoform switching events common to multiple cancer types, several of which involve genes with established mechanistic roles in oncogenesis. The presence of neoantigen-containing peptides derived from these transcripts was confirmed in broad cancer and normal tissue proteome datasets and the binding affinity of predicted neoantigens to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex via molecular dynamics simulations. The study presents strong evidence that isoform switching in cancer is a significant source of actionable neoantigens that have the capability to trigger an immune response. These findings suggest that isoform switching events could potentially be leveraged for broad immunotherapeutic strategies across various cancer types.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by a dense and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME) composed of various cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). In this study, we explored the composition and proportions of CAF subtypes within the PDAC TME and identified three distinct CAF-related TME subtypes: iCAF-rich, myCAF-rich, and PSC-rich. We observed significant heterogeneity in CAF populations across different patients, which correlated with patient prognosis and the mechanical and fibrotic properties of the TME. Our analysis revealed that these CAF subtypes exhibit distinct gene expression profiles, with the myCAF-rich subtype showing upregulation of hypoxia- and glycolysis-related genes, such as LDHA. Furthermore, gene set and survival analyses demonstrated that specific CAF subtypes harbor unique protective and risk factors, which were non-overlapping between the subtypes. These findings suggest that the heterogeneity of CAF subtypes plays a critical role in PDAC progression and therapeutic response. By utilizing multiplex immunohistochemistry and spatial transcriptomics, we also identified key CAF subpopulations, such as iCAF_17, iCAF_19, and myCAF_12, which were found to interact closely with tumor cells and macrophages. In chemotherapy-treated patients, myCAFs were positioned at the tumor boundary, potentially acting as a barrier to tumor invasion. This study provides novel insights into CAF-related TME subtypes, offering a foundation for future therapeutic strategies targeting CAFs in PDAC.">

 We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing data from the Sequential NCI-CLARITY cohort (GSE229772). Tumor biopsies were collected longitudinally. We also used the Multi-Regional Cohort (GSE189903), where single cells were isolated from multiple regions (tumor cores, borders, and adjacent normal tissues). Gene signatures in the anabolic and catabolic axis were applied to classify cells into four distinct metabolic clusters: O, W, W/O, and Q. To predict metabolic fluxome and variations, we used FLUXestimator, an online platform that implements single cell flux estimation analysis (scFEA). This unsupervised approach uses a neural network architecture to estimate reaction rates from transcriptomics data. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to corroborate our findings.
 Our analysis identified the four distinct metabolic clusters across both cohorts. Briefly, the O cluster is characterized by high oxidative phosphorylation and is associated with better clinical outcomes. The W cluster is defined by high glycolytic activity and is linked to aggressive tumor behavior. The W/O cluster represents a hybrid state with both high glycolytic and oxidative activities, contributing to metabolic flexibility and tumor aggressiveness. The Q cluster relies heavily on glutamine metabolism and is associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance. Normal liver cells were predominantly grouped into the O cluster, with hepatocytes displaying low HIF1, AMPK, and MYC activity, indicative of normal metabolic function. Similarly, border cancer cells were conformed in a distinct cluster, characterized by a low HIF1 score, but a higher AMPK score. Temporal analysis from the Sequential NCI-CLARITY cohort revealed dynamic changes in the distribution of these clusters over time, reflecting the evolution of cancer phenotypes. FLUXestimator predictions and pathway enrichment analysis indicated significant changes in metabolic pathways, supporting the observed phenotypic shifts. This approach validates our comprehensive network model and suggests a method for developing new metabolic networks for cancer modeling based on key features observed during cancer progression.
 This study reveals metabolic diversity in HCC and iCCA tumors, identifying clusters linked to tumor progression stages. These phenotypic traits may serve as a potential biomarker for better clinical outcomes.

 Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive brain tumor, is treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, yet 90% recur within two years. PD-1 blockade improves outcomes in other cancers, but shows limited effect in GBM, likely due to tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This study aims to investigate post-treatment transcriptional changes in tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in matched primary and recurrent GBM, focusing on neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade.



 We used the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler to spatially select and transcriptomically profile tumor cells (SOX2+) and TAMs (IBA1+). Gene expression changes between primary and recurrent GBMs were analyzed in 30 patients (26 IDHwt, 4 IDHm) with 20 paired primary samples. All patients received standard treatment, and 20 also received second-line nivolumab one week before recurrence surgery. Tumor purity was confirmed using InferCNV and cell signatures. Subsequently, differential expression and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to compare recurrent tumors treated with nivolumab to those untreated, as well as primary vs. recurrent tumors. We also evaluated Neftel signatures in matched tumors to assess treatment- and recurrence-associated malignant state changes.



 Principal component analysis of all samples revealed distinct transcriptional profiles between tumor cells and TAMs. Separate analyses showed clear differences in tumor cell and TAM segments based on tumor status (primary/recurrent), though no separation related to nivolumab treatment. Similarly, comparing nivolumab-treated recurrent tumors with untreated controls showed no significant changes in malignant states or gene expression in tumor cells or TAMs, consistent with the lack of clinical survival benefit.To investigate overall transcriptional changes induced by standard treatment, differential expression analysis comparing tumor cell segments in paired primary and recurrent tumors revealed few significant genes, likely reflecting high inter-patient variability driven by tumor heterogeneity. Unsupervised clustering of tumor cell segments identified a distinct cluster specific to recurrent tumors, with DEGs highlighting pathways linked to this particular tumor cell phenotype. In TAM segments, increased expression of checkpoint-related genes in recurrent tumors suggests TAM phenotype changes that may influence immune dynamics in the microenvironment.



 Spatial profiling of matched primary and recurrent GBM samples reveals distinct transcriptional changes in both tumor cells and TAMs, reflecting the complex microenvironment of recurrent GBM. However, our findings point to a limited impact of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade on transcriptional activity, highlighting ongoing challenges in targeting GBM with immunotherapy.

 Background:
 Intratumoral heterogeneity, driven by phenotypic plasticity, contributes to disease progression and therapy failures. However, a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms is still lacking. Breast cancer exemplifies this with its histological and molecular diversity; estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), progesterone receptor-positive (PR+), and HER2- luminal A subtypes, such as the MCF7 cell line, are not the exception. While single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and three-dimensional multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) represent initial approaches to understanding heterogeneity, integrating these tools with computational strategies offers new paths to uncover the regulatory groundwork of tumor behavior. When modeled via Boolean frameworks, transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) provide a dynamic platform for studying gene interactions, identifying attractors (stable cellular states corresponding to distinct phenotypes), and simulating cellular transitions. This study represents the first step in constructing such a framework for ER+ breast cancer to advance precision medicine and improve therapeutic strategies.
 Methods:
 Regulatory elements relevant to the MCF7 cell line were identified through an extensive review of NCBI literature. Interactions were strictly curated based on evidence quality (ranging from robust experimental validation to predictive hypotheses), and evaluated for type and significance, such as feedback loops, activation, coactivation, and inhibition. Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) were used to translate regulatory connections into Boolean functions to simulate binary gene expression dynamics. The final TRN was visualized using Cytoscape (v3.10.3) with a hierarchical layout.
 Results:
 The TRN consists of 54 nodes and 81 interactions, representing the regulatory landscape of ER+, PR+, and HER2- breast cancer. Boolean equations offer a framework for simulating the evolution of binary states to attractors, enabling the observation of how perturbations, such as gene overexpression or silencing, influence heterogeneity. While simulation and attractor analyses are ongoing, the network provides a foundation for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying breast cancer plasticity.
 Conclusions:
 This study highlights the potential of integrating experimental data, TRN reconstruction, and Boolean modeling to understand intratumoral heterogeneity. Our rigorously curated model establishes a foundational framework for precision oncology and the integration of experimental and computational methods.

 Cancer heterogeneity poses a significant medical challenge, necessitating therapies tailored not only to individual patients but also to the unique cancer clones that exist within diverse microenvironmental contexts. Despite this diversity, nearly all cancer cells share a reliance on telomeres to maintain genomic stability. The telomerase (hTERT) gene is hyperactive in many cancers and has been identified as a potential target for treatment. While this has led to the development of multiple telomerase-targeting approaches, disappointingly, none have been approved in clinical applications yet. To circumvent this concern, our team has applied a genetic approach called synthetic dosage lethality (SDL), to exploit hTERT overexpression to identify potential targets to treat cancer. SDL is a genetic concept, where a normally non-lethal gene inactivation kills cells only in the context of overexpression of another gene like hTERT. Our laboratories have used lentiviral-based pooled CRISPR/Cas9 and pooled shRNA-screening platforms to systematically query the genome and recently identified several SDL partners of hTERT. Through extensive validation using pooled in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screens across multiple cell lines, tumor xenografts, and patient-derived organoids, we identified RMT1, an RNA 2'-O-methyltransferase, as a prominent SDL partner of hTERT. In collaboration with the AtomWise and Thoth Biosimulations companies, we have developed novel inhibitors for RMT1 that preferentially suppress hTERT-overexpressing cell lines growth and viability. We have also performed a large-scale screen of FDA-approved small molecule inhibitors with the goal of repurposing these drugs to target hTERT-overexpressing cancers. Subsequently, we plan to apply these therapies in combination to amplify the efficiency of treatment against cancers, yielding preclinical evidence to support the development of novel cancer therapies. Since hTERT activity is essential in all cancer cells, our findings introduce a transformative approach to overcoming cancer cell heterogeneity by targeting the SDL interactions of hTERT. This strategy also capitalizes on the ubiquitous overexpression of hTERT in all cancer types, enabling the selective eradication of hTERT-dependent malignancies.

 Multidisciplinary treatment drives conversion surgery of pancreatic cancer with liver metastatic clinical cases with unresectable features. The adjuvant regime included AG and FOLFIRINOX and partial cases exhibited no poor response for the treatment. We analyzed single cell spatial transcriptome data to explore biomarkers of therapy.



 The GSE202051 and GSE199102 cohorts derived from GEO database. The quality control, analysis, and plotting of single cell spatial transcriptome rely on the R packages including R packages ISCHIA, robustbase, data.table, ggplot2, Seurat, dplyr, factoextra, cluster, showtext, gridExtra, and pdftools.



 Malignant biomarkers in liver metastatic samples We drew dim plots to display spatial distribution of various types cells in primary and liver metastatic pancreatic cancer samples. We selected subset of tumor epithelial cells to analyze clusters and displayed c0-c26 tumor epithelial clusters in primary and liver metastatic two groups with dim plots and bar plot. The clusters among c0(59.2%), c5(32.8%), c6(32.4%), and c10(21.9%) possessed more enrichment distribution in liver metastatic region. We used the function FindAllMarkers to analyze top differentiation expression genes in clusters and found three prominent genes including TNFSF14, CYP2E1, and LCN2(Fig1).Stromal microenvironment evolution driven liver metastatic biomarkers gene We calculated and settled each cell type proportion data in each sample based on spatial transcriptome information. Subsequently, we drew the correlation heatmap to discover the positive correlation of TNFSF14 expression levels in tumor epithelial cells with endothelial cells(R=0.64, pvalue=0.032) and negative correlation of CYP2E1 with CAF(R=-0.91, pvalue<0.001) in primary cell type proportion. We identify CYP2E1 driving myCAF changes in stromal microenvironment. For the purpose of exploring extinct myCAF subtypes in volution, we also displayed the correlation heatmap to discover the correlation results of c0-c14 myCAF clusters with CYP2E1 gene expression. Interestingly, only positive result demonstrated positive correlation between c5 cluster and CYP2E1 gene(R=0.76, pvalue<001). The heatmap displayed that CYP2E1 expressed prominently in c5 cluster myCAF. Simultaneously, we identified the expression tendency in samples with neoadjuvant therapy and displayed the positive correlation between CYP2E1 and poor response(Fig2).



 Our study used single cell spatial transcriptome data with in-depth explaining spatial distribution and expression levels and explored vital biomarker CYP2E1 in pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis. A series of experiments and clinical trials would be designed and conducted by our team in future.

        <tr id="Lung cancer leads cancer-related deaths worldwide, with 2024 estimates of 234,580 new cases in the United States. This study explores the roles of tumor driver aberrations, epithelial transcriptional states, and microenvironment composition in lung cancer outcomes using proteogenomic data from 965 patients across the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC). We examined oncogenic alterations, epithelial and stromal cell type enrichment distributions, transcriptional modules activities, and drug sensitivities in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), squamous carcinoma (LUSC) and adenocarcinoma with no conventional drivers (NCD-LUAD).LUAD tumors displayed mutual exclusivity in RAS/Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) pathway aberrations, complemented by significant patterns of co-occurrence and exclusivity in tumor suppressor genes like TP53, STK11, RBM10, and CDKN2A. Our integrative analysis used gene expression from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA) derived cell types reference and CPTAC bulk RNA/proteomic data for correlation-based estimation of epithelial/stromal cell type enrichment. We assembled scRNA references from 3 different studies that profiled normal tissues containing, 142 cell types from 38 tissue types, 20 stromal cell types from 11 tissues, and lastly exclusive lung cell types reference respectively. We found significant enrichment of AT2 and Club cells in LUAD tumors (p-value < 0.0001), in addition heterogeneity in epithelial cell type enrichment within each driver group. Patients enriched for AT2 and AT1 cells demonstrated better survival outcomes (p-value < 0.0001) while, secretory Goblet and Basal cells enrichment was associated with poor survival (p-value < 0.0001), underscoring the potential link between tumor transcriptional / differentiation states and prognostic implications. NCD-LUAD showed similar epithelial cell type enrichment patterns like LUADs with known drivers while LUSC tumors show predominant basal cell enrichment. Importantly we saw specific transcriptional modules (up: E2F1,MYBL2, down: NKX2-1, NFE2L2) and cell type enrichment differences in genome unstable (high copy number burden) tumors associated with poor survival. Finally, enrichment of a myofibroblast subtype associated with survival and immune infiltration status, warrants further investigation. Cell line drug sensitivity analysis showed that the RTK-altered group with poor response to targeted therapy was enriched with undetermined differentiation transcriptional status compared to more defined cell type enrichments in the good response group (p-value = 0.016). Our study underscores the importance of multi-dimensional integrative analysis approaches of molecular, cellular, and pharmacological data to understand and advance lung cancer biology, potential cell of origin, and therapeutic strategies.

 Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is the stand of care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). For microsatellite-stable (MSS) LARC patients, combining immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with radiotherapy has shown improved tumor regression, though the mechanisms behind tumor response remain unclear. Here, we analyzed 60 pre-, mid- and post-treatment tumor samples from 39 LARC patients in the TORCH clinical trial, utilizing single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to explore cell dynamics and their association with therapeutic efficacy. In well responders, combination therapy expanded the CD8+ and CD4+ memory T cell pool, which interacted with type 2 dendritic cells and clustered around non-malignant epithelial cells, forming part of tertiary lymphoid structures, as validated by spatial transcriptomics. In poor responders, the tumor microenvironment was enriched with immunosuppressive cells clustering around cancer-associated fibroblasts. This study uncovers mechanisms underlying the efficacy of radiotherapy combined with ICIs and provides valuable resources for identifying targets in MSS LARC patients.

 The progression of colorectal cancer is highly influenced by various environmental and genetic conditions, however, we can highlight tumor heterogeneity presenting serious resistance to targeted therapies and having crucial effects on disease outcomes. Motivated by this issue, we aimed to develop an end-to-end single-cell sequencing workflow starting from morphology-derived sample isolation from different regions of a tissue slide continue with exome sequencing to investigate the patterns of tumor heterogeneity.
 Colonic biopsy specimens were collected during the endoscopic procedure, then cryosections (15 μm) were prepared and mounted on MMI MembraneSlides. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was applied to visualize the tissue morphology. Single-cell samples were obtained from 12 individual regions of negative control (NEG), tumor-associated normal (NAT), and colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. Each sample had a diameter of 30-40 μm and a height of approximately 10-20 μm and was cut from a membrane frame slide by laser microdissection method. Following the single-cell DNA extraction and library preparation (Qiagen GmbH, CA, US), we performed paired-end next generation sequencing using NextSeq High Output kit on a NextSeq 500/550 instrument (IIllumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Finally, we implemented bioinformatics analysis focusing on the patterns of tissue heterogeneity in the samples illustrated by CRC-specific mutated genes.
 We obtained sequencing data with an average of 30X coverage. We investigated the mutually exclusive and co-occurring gene pairs and found that the co-occurrence of genes corresponding to near-tumor tissues was more significantly detected (such as TTN-ADGRE1 in CRC with p<0.05). Our observations on single-cell tumor heterogeneity revealed that the different regions associated with the tumor - including negative control tissues - displayed altered mutation and heterogeneity profiles. Eventually, we presented the onco-mutation motifs of tissue regions which showed that the occurrence of mutations in genes BRAF (4/12), FBXW7 (2/12), and PCDH17 (1/12) in CRC samples are linked to resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy. Additionally, the non-zero mutation rate of COL5A1 (1/12) gene in NAT indicates poorer survival outcome of patients. Supplementary, we aimed to present additional therapy resistant mutations characteristic to antiangiogenic, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), chemo- and cetuximab therapies.
 In our study, we identified region-specific heterogeneity motifs and demonstrated the individual and cumulative heterogeneity patterns of CRC and NAT single-cell-like samples. Additionally, we successfully detected high impact actionable mutations that influence therapy response and survival chances.

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous hematological malignancy characterized by diverse genetic and epigenetic aberrations, making therapeutic interventions particularly challenging. We have identified a novel combination therapy that leverages differences in cell cycle dynamics to induce AML cell differentiation, and found AML cells which were highly sensitive to inhibitors of the histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1A depending on their cell cycle profile. Here, we aim at identifying other potential epigenetic vulnerabilities of AML cell lines exposed to the treatment with different CDK inhibitors. Given the heterogeneity of the epigenetic aberrations found in AML, targeting additional chromatin regulators could improve the clinical applicability of this combination therapy. Thus, we started an in vitro CRISPR-screening approach, targeting over 600 chromatin-related genes. Following optimization of Cas9-expressing clones and evaluation of knockout (KO) efficiency, we confirmed that the best-performing clone retained phenotypic consistency with parental cells under combination therapy. Preliminary data validated the effectiveness of our screening platform, as sgRNAs targeting LSD1 recapitulated the phenotype observed with CDK inhibitors treatment, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. In parallel, we investigated the molecular link between cell cycle manipulation and chromatin remodeling. We conducted a nuclear phospho-proteomics experiment on cells treated with CDK inhibitors. This analysis identified differential phosphorylation of several proteins, which are currently under investigation. Additionally, gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment in pathways regulating RNA metabolism, transcription, and DNA damage response. By integrating cell cycle modulation with epigenetic targeting, our work offers new insights into AML differentiation therapy, with the potential to improve therapeutic outcomes in diverse AML subtypes.

        <tr id="
 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed malignancy in Canada, where nearly half of diagnoses occur at late stages. The tumor microenvironment (TME), including host mesenchymal, immune, and endothelial cells, is an important driver of colorectal tumor progression toward late-stage disease. Tumor cells can instruct the TME to support invasion and metastasis via angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Next-generation cancer therapeutics must account for the complexities of the TME. Thus, the discovery of vulnerabilities therein is of critical importance. Our group contributed to a study showing that the hemi-deletion of the 16p11.2 locus (16p11.2+/-), associated with the autism spectrum disorder, significantly impairs cortical vascularization. Given that several genes within 16p11.2 are critical to CRC development, we found that primary CRC tumors with high 16p11.2 locus activity correlated with shorter overall survival rates than low 16p11.2 activity tumors. Pan-cancer hazard ratio analysis showed this relationship with 16p11.2 gene expression is specific to CRC. To study the role of the 16p11.2 locus in CRC tumor progression, we introduced a monoallelic deletion of the 7F3 locus (homologous to human 16p11.2 and termed h16p11.2 for clarity) in the APCmin/AOM tumorigenesis model. CRC tumors developing in the h16p11.2-deficient animals showed a significantly reduced size. Similarly, syngeneic CRC tumor engraftment assays using MC38 cells (h16p11.2 wt) showed delayed tumor growth in h16p11.2-deficient recipients compared to wt controls. CRC tumors developing in an h16p11.2-deficient niche presented significant disruptions in critical elements of the TME. Specifically, 3D mapping of CD31-positive endothelial structures revealed a 50% reduction in blood vessel density for tumors engrafted into h16p11.2-deficient animals. Transcriptome profiling of tumor and tumor-adjacent tissues identified several aspects of the TME perturbed by the h16p11.2-deficient niche, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and enhanced adaptive immune response in macrophages. Polarized light microscopy and immunohistochemistry confirmed ECM gene regulation by showing a reorganization of collagen fiber and SPARCL1 deposition inside CRC tumor mass. Moreover, macrophage infiltration is enhanced within CRC tumors grown in a h16p11.2-deficient TME, with enhanced M1 anti-tumor and reduced M2 pro-tumor polarization. Overall, our data support that a 16p11.2-deficient TME represents an inhospitable niche for CRC tumor growth and progression. Gaining a better understanding of the biological mechanisms associated with lower 16p11.2 locus activity in CRC will reveal novel treatment modalities targeting both tumor and TME tissues.

        <tr id="Rare tumors are unique cancers that often present distinct biological behaviors and treatment responses. Researchers face significant challenges in the study of those tumors due to limited patient samples, lack of comprehensive genomic data, and difficulties in establishing appropriate preclinical models for effective drug testing. The identification of effective drug combinations for cancer treatment remains a major challenge, largely due to tumor heterogeneity and variable therapeutic responses. ATR is a key kinase involved in the DNA damage response. The combination of ATR inhibitors with temozolomide (TMZ) [ATRi+TMZ] enhances the cytotoxic effects of TMZ by targeting DNA damage response pathways, particularly in cancer cells with impaired DNA repair mechanisms, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors resistant to conventional treatments. This study utilized gene expression profiling of 38 rare tumor patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models available in the NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository (PDMR) (https://pdmr.cancer.gov) to identify potential biomarkers that predict responses to TMZ combined with either of two ATR inhibitors, i.e., AZD6738 (Ceralasertib) and BAY1895344 (Elimusertib). We conducted comprehensive analyses including gene expression correlation with response, network interaction and gene set enrichment analysis. Our study revealed that lower MGMT expression (i.e., MGMTlow, normalized count <50) in PDX models was associated with sensitivity to ATRi+TMZ combination therapy as expected; 3/4 and 4/4 MGMTlow models were sensitive to AZD6738+TMZ and BAY1895344+TMZ combination, respectively. However, MGMThigh status did not necessarily denote resistance; a portion of MGMThigh models were also sensitive to the ATRi+TMZ combinations. In MGMThigh PDXs, network analysis and GSEA revealed that ATRi+TMZ sensitive models had significant (p<0.001) enrichment of highly expressed DNA replication genes such as MCM2 compared to resistant models. Moreover, elevated MCM2 expression was associated with sensitivity to ATRi+TMZ: 8/8 and 7/9 MGMThigh/MCM2high models were sensitive to AZD6738+TMZ and BAY1895344+TMZ, respectively. Correspondingly, 14/18 and 24/24 MGMThigh/MCM2low PDX models were resistant to AZD6738+TMZ and BAY1895344+TMZ, respectively. We used mass spectrometry-based proteomics data from a subset of rare tumor models in our RNAseq-based dataset to validate the MGMT/MCM2 expression association with ATRi+TMZ response, confirming a similar trend. Our findings revealed distinct expression signatures associated with favorable responses to two ATR inhibitors when individually combined with TMZ, highlighting candidate markers that could guide treatment decisions. Additional validation in a larger study would establish the potential utility of these candidate genes for patient selection in clinical trials.
