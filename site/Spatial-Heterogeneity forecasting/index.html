        <tr id="Intratumoral variability is a seminal feature of human tumors contributing to tumor progression and response to treatment. Current technologies are unsuitable to accurately track phenotypes and subclonal evolution within tumors, especially in response to genetic manipulations. Here, we developed epitope combinatorial tags (EpicTags), which we coupled to multiplexed ion beam imaging (EpicMIBI) for in situ tracking of barcodes within tissue microenvironments. Using this platform, we dissected the spatial component of cell lineages and phenotypes in a xenograft model of small-cell lung cancer. We observed emergent properties from mixed clones leading to the preferential expansion of subclonal patches for both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cancer cell states in this model. In tumors harboring a fraction of PTEN-deficient cancer cells, we uncovered a non-autonomous increase of subclonal patch size in PTEN wildtype cancer cells. EpicMIBI can facilitate in situ interrogation of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic processes involved in intratumoral heterogeneity.">

        <tr id="Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by high malignancy and early propensity for metastasis, and modest response to immunotherapy due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Surgical intervention has shown benefits in treating early-stage SCLC. However, most patients experience recurrence after surgery. The factors associated with relapse free survival in these patients remain unclear. We collected operation specimens from ten early-stage SCLC patients (N0M0), conducted long-term follow-up, and grouped them based on disease status. Subsequently, we performed a retrospective analysis using single-cell spatial imaging mass cytometry to explore the characteristics of tumor cells and differences in the tumor microenvironment, especially the single-cell constitute of immune cells, between the two groups. We found that, in early-stage SCLC, tumor cells display pronounced heterogeneity, both intra-group and inter-group. Patients with early recurrence are characterized by a distinct subpopulation of tumor cells with high Ki-67 expression. Non-relapse patients demonstrate better infiltration of M1 macrophages and stromal cells. Neighborhood analysis suggested that positive interactions between macrophages, stromal cells, and T cells with tumor cells may benefit patient prognosis. Additionally, recurrent tumor cells might enhance their metastatic capacity and remodel the microenvironment through upregulation of GranzymeB or reduction of c-Myc expression. In conclusion, SCLC tumor cells demonstrate tumor heterogeneity and microenvironmental changes in the early clinical stages. A higher proportion of M1 macrophages is associated with prolonged postoperative survival in early-stage SCLC patients. This research provides novel insights and evidence for treating and preventing postoperative recurrence in SCLC.

        <tr id="A comprehensive understanding of cellular behavior and response to the tumor microenvironment (TME) in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains elusive. Here, we introduce the high-definition Visium spatial transcriptomic technology (Visium HD) and investigate formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human CRC samples (n = 5). We demonstrate the high sensitivity, single-cell-scale resolution and spatial accuracy of Visium HD, generating a highly refined whole-transcriptome spatial profile of CRC samples. We identify transcriptomically distinct macrophage subpopulations in different spatial niches with potential pro-tumor and anti-tumor functions via interactions with tumor and T cells. In situ gene expression analysis validates our findings and localizes a clonally expanded T cell population close to macrophages with anti-tumor features. Our study demonstrates the power of high-resolution spatial technologies to understand cellular interactions in the TME and paves the way for larger studies that will unravel mechanisms and biomarkers of CRC biology, improving diagnosis and disease management strategies.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment is heterogeneous, structurally complex, and continually evolving, making it difficult to fully capture. Common dissociative techniques thoroughly characterize the heterogeneity of cellular populations but lack structural context. The recent boom in spatial analyses has exponentially accelerated our understanding of the structural complexity of these cellular populations. However, to understand the dynamics of cancer pathogenesis, we must assess this heterogeneity across space and time. In this review, we provide an overview of current dissociative, spatial, and temporal analysis strategies in addition to existing and prospective spatiotemporal techniques to illustrate how understanding the tumor microenvironment, focusing on dynamic immune-cancer cell interactions, across four dimensions will advance cancer research and its diagnostic and therapeutic applications.">

        <tr id="Live-cell imaging (LCI) of modified T cells co-cultured with cancer cells is commonly used to quantify T cell anti-cancer function. Videos captured by LCI show complex multi-cell behavioral phenotypes that go beyond simple cancer cell fluorescence measurements. Here, we develop an unsupervised analysis workflow to characterize LCI data generated using the Incucyte imaging platform. Unlike most LCI analyses, we avoid cell segmentation due to the low spatiotemporal resolution of the LCI videos and high levels of cell-cell contact. Instead, we develop methods that identify global aggregation patterns and local cellular keypoints to characterize the multicellular interactions that determine cancer cell sensitivity to, or escape from, T cell surveillance. We demonstrate our segmentation-free live-cell behavioral analysis (SF-LCBA) methods on TCR T cells from four donors with varying proportions of cells with a beneficial RASA2 knockout and effector-to-target initial concentrations in a co-culture with A375 melanoma cells. We find that different T cell modifications affect the spatiotemporal dynamics of multicellular aggregate formation. In particular, we show that fewer and smaller cancer cell aggregates form at high ratios of effector T cells to target cancer cells and high titrations of T cells with RASA2 knockouts. Our SF-LCBA method identifies, characterizes, and tracks cellular aggregate formation in datasets that are unsuitable for cell segmentation and tracking, opening the door to more therapeutically-relevant measurements of modified T cell therapy cell behavioral phenotypes from LCI data.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC), including both microsatellite instability (MSI) and microsatellite stability (MSS) subtypes, frequently exhibits intrinsic resistance to immunotherapy. However, the spatial tumor microenvironment (TME) and its role in distinguishing immunotherapy responders from non-responders remain poorly understood. In this study, spatial multiomics, including imaging mass cytometry (n = 50 in-house), spatial proteomics (n = 50 in-house), and spatial transcriptomics (n = 9 in-house), were employed to elucidate the spatial TME of metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients receiving immunotherapy. These methodologies were integrated with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), bulk RNA-seq, and bulk proteomics for comprehensive analysis and validation. A spatial immune atlas containing 314,774 cells was constructed. We found that C1QC+ resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) were more abundant in responders regardless of microsatellite status. Co-localization of C1QC+ RTMs with CD4+ T cells was observed in responders, and MHC-II expression facilitated their interaction. In contrast, cancer-associated fibroblasts inhibited this interaction in non-responders. Moreover, whole genome screening identified key genes involved in antigen presentation in C1QC+ RTMs. Hence, our study highlights the importance of spatial immune mapping in revealing the complex spatial topology of CRC and corresponding immunotherapy response.">

        <tr id="The spatial proteomic profiling of complex tissues is essential for investigating cellular function in physiological and pathological states. However, the imbalance among resolution, protein coverage, and expense precludes their systematic application to analyze whole tissue sections in an unbiased manner and with high resolution. Here, we introduce panoramic spatial enhanced resolution proteomics (PSERP), a method that combines tissue expansion, automated sample segmentation, and tryptic digestion with high-throughput proteomic profiling. The PSERP approach facilitates rapid quantitative profiling of proteomic spatial variability in whole tissue sections at sub-millimeter resolution. We demonstrated the utility of this method for determining the streamlined large-scale spatial proteomic features of gliomas. Specifically, we profiled spatial proteomic features for nine glioma samples across three different mutation types (IDH1-WT/EGFR-mutant, IDH1-mutant, and IDH1/EGFR-double-WT gliomas) at sub-millimeter resolution (corresponding to a total of 2,230 voxels). The results revealed over 10,000 proteins identified in a single slide, which helps us to portray the diverse proteins and pathways with spatial abundance patterns in the context of tumor heterogeneity and cellular features. Our spatial proteomic data revealed distinctive proteomic features of malignant and non-malignant tumor regions and depicted the distribution of proteins from tumor centers to tumor borders and non-malignant tumor regions. Through integrative analysis with single-cell transcriptomic data, we elucidated the cellular composition and cell–cell communications in a spatial context. Our PSERP also includes a spatially resolved tumor-specific peptidome identification workflow that not only enables us to elucidate the spatial expression patterns of tumor-specific peptides in glioma samples with different genomic types but also provides us with opportunities to select combinations of tumor-specific mutational peptides whose expression could cover the maximum tumor regions for future immune therapies. We further demonstrated that combining tumor-specific peptides might enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in both patient-derived cell (PDC) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. PSERP efficiently retains precise spatial proteomic information within the tissue context and provides a deeper understanding of tissue biology and pathology at the molecular level.

        <tr id="How the host immune system loses its surveillance function during the evolution from normal cell to malignancy is still largely unknown. Here, we investigate the dynamics changes of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor microenvironment by profiling 132,115 single-cell transcriptomes derived from 51 tissues, including healthy pancreatic tissue, non-metastatic PDAC primary tumors, metastatic primary tumors, and patient-matched liver metastases. The cellular proportion, bio-functional, and interaction between each cell type are carefully characterized. Aberrant copy number variations (CNVs) indicating malignant intensity are identified at chromosomes 7 and 20 of epithelial cells during tumor development. A bio-functional transition of predominant genes from physiology to pancreatic oncogenesis and metastasis is observed. Combinatorial analysis of epithelial cells and immunocytes indicates a gradient loss of immune surveillance during the malignant transformation. By dissecting cellular interaction, we unravel an incremental tumor cell-triggered apoptosis of DCs through molecular pair ANXA1-FPR1/3. Consequently, the activation and infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are dampened progressively. Remarkably, we unveil a novel subtype of stress-response NK cells (strNK), which are characterized by robust proliferation, diminished cytolytic capabilities, and negative immune regulation. Notably, the presence of strNK cells is associated with poor prognosis of PDAC patients, implying a potential pro-tumor function. Taken together, our results not only shed light on the intricate mechanisms underlying step-wise evasion of immune surveillance during PDAC tumor development, but also provide a potential strategy for holding back malignant transition by reinforcing DCs’ function.">

 Background:
 Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet a large fraction of patients remain refractory to treatment. Understanding treatment response requires characterization of immune cell populations and their spatial organization, as cellular neighborhoods critically influence immune cell recruitment, activation, and function. Current imaging-based and NGS-based methods struggle to achieve clear separation of individual cells in densely packed regions. Hence, we developed STAMP-seq, a novel method tagging single nuclei with cleavable spatial barcodes using high-density DNA sequencing chips, to uncover immunotherapy response-related modules and dynamic changes in NSCLC.
 Methods:
 STAMP-seq employs spatially-encoded DNA arrays to label individual nuclei with cleavable barcodes. Following validation in mouse brain tissue, we analyzed surgically resected NSCLC samples from immunotherapy-treated patients, integrating spatial transcriptomics with BCR profiling to characterize treatment response features.
 Results:
 STAMP-seq achieves precise spatial barcoding, detecting over 30,000 cells per adult mouse brain section with reliable cell subtype assignment. In immunotherapy-treated NSCLC samples, spatial analysis revealed distinct cellular communities associated with treatment response. Responding patients showed enrichment of tertiary lymphoid structures and specialized plasma cell niches, with tumor cells exhibiting elevated TNF-α signaling and reduced proliferation. These tumor cells showed proximity to

 ROBO2

 + CAFs while remaining distant from

 ACTA2

 + CAFs. BCR clonotype and pseudotime analysis revealed that

 IGHG1

 + plasma cells are recruited from TLS or vasculature by stromal-rich "transit stops" containing antigen-presenting capabilities CAFs through

 HMGB1

 -

 CXCR4

 interaction.
 Conclusions:
 STAMP-seq enables high-resolution spatial transcriptomics at single-nucleus level. Our characterization of NSCLC spatial architecture revealed previously unrecognized immune response organization, particularly how specialized stromal-rich "transit stops" coordinate cancer-suppressing plasma cell recruitment. These findings demonstrate how spatial information can advance diagnostic and prognostic module development for human diseases.

        <tr id="Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) can be invasive or aggressive, yet the mechanisms behind these behaviors remain poorly understood, impeding treatment advancements. Here, we integrat single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, analyzing over 177,000 cells and 35,000 spots across 57 tissue samples. This comprehensive approach facilitates the identification of PitNETs tumor populations and characterizes the reconfiguration of the tumor microenvironment (TME) as PitNETs progress and invade. We trace the trajectory of TPIT-lineage PitNETs and identify an aggressive tumor cluster marked by elevated p53-mediated proliferation and a higher Trouillas classification, both associated with tumor progression. Additionally, we document the heterogeneity of immune stromal cells within PitNETs, particularly noting the enrichment of SPP1+ tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in invasive tumors. These TAMs facilitate tumor invasion through the SPP1-ITGAV/ITGB1 signaling pathway. Our in-depth single-cell and spatial analysis of PitNETs uncovers the molecular dynamics within the TME, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention.">

Reference-based cell type deconvolution methods were developed to understand cell type distributions for ST. However, batch/platform discrepancies between references and ST impact their accuracy. Results We present Region-based Cell Sorting (ReSort), which utilizes ST's region-level data to lessen reliance on reference data and alleviate these technical issues. In simulation studies, ReSort enhances reference-based deconvolution methods. Applying ReSort to a mouse breast cancer model highlights macrophages M0 and M2 enrichment in the epithelial clone, revealing insights into epithelial-mesenchymal transition and immune infiltration.

        <tr id="Recent studies have revealed that polyclonality—where multiple distinct subclones cooperate during early tumor development—is a critical feature of tumor evolution, as demonstrated by Sadien et al. and Lu et al. in Nature (October 2024). These findings show that early polyclonal interactions can overcome fitness barriers, ultimately transitioning to monoclonality as dominant clones emerge. Understanding and targeting these interclonal dynamics offers new therapeutic opportunities. In this perspective, we outline how computational modeling and artificial intelligence (AI) tools can provide deeper insights into tumor polyclonality and identify actionable therapeutic strategies. By applying ligand–receptor interaction analysis, clonal trajectory reconstruction, network and pathway modeling, and spatial analysis, researchers can prioritize communication hubs, evolutionary bottlenecks, and microenvironmental niches that sustain tumor progression. These approaches, when integrated with experimental validation, offer a translational pathway from foundational discoveries to personalized cancer treatments aimed at disrupting cooperative subclonal ecosystems and preventing malignant progression. We commend the recent Nature publications, “Polyclonality overcomes fitness barriers in Apc-driven tumorigenesis” by Sadien et al. [1] and “Polyclonal-to-monoclonal transition in colorectal precancerous evolution” by Lu et al. [2], both featured on 2024 October 30. These groundbreaking studies employed distinct lineage tracing methods to investigate the origins and evolutionary dynamics of colorectal and intestinal tumorigenesis. Despite their different approaches, both studies reached convergent conclusions: Polyclonality plays a pivotal role in the early stages of tumor development, providing critical insights into how diverse cellular populations collaborate to overcome fitness barriers and drive tumor progression.">

        <tr id="Background Transcriptomic and genomic analyses of bladder cancer (BC) reveal a highly diverse disease stratified into molecular subtypes with distinct molecular features and biological behaviors. Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and plasticity can significantly impact diagnosis and patient management, yet their extent in BC remains highly debated. Here, we investigated whether the three main bladder cancer subtypes maintain or alter their identity in response to changes in the microenvironment and during metastatic colonization. Methods Seven patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representing the major BC subtypes were propagated into three distinct tissue microenvironments: subcutaneous, mammary fat pad and under the kidney capsule. Metastatic lesions were generated via systemic injection of tumor cells. Tumor samples were analysed using RNA- and exome sequencing, SNP-arrays and histopathology to assess subtype fidelity, genomic evolution, and clonal dynamics. Results A comprehensive, longitudinal multiomics analysis showed that tumors consistently maintain their molecular subtype, as well as their transcriptomic and genomic profiles, across different environments. No evidence of emerging ITH or subtype transitions was observed, regardless of the microenvironment. The transcriptomic adaptations observed in metastases and different implantation sites are limited and are associated primarily with hypoxia, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and invasion. Conclusions Our results suggest that invasive bladder cancers have a strong intrinsic tumor identity that is not easily reprogrammed by the microenvironment.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an innovative technology that maps gene expression while preserving tissue structure, offering new perspectives on disease mechanisms in the lung. This review explores how ST has advanced our understanding of lung cancer and other pulmonary diseases. In lung cancer, ST helps reveal tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion mechanisms, and spatially distinct cellular subtypes that influence therapy response. In diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, ST identifies localized immune niches, fibroblast diversity, and vascular remodeling that drive disease progression. The review also compares major ST platforms like GeoMx, Visium, and Xenium and highlights current clinical trials and future directions. By integrating molecular insights with spatial context, ST holds great promise for improving diagnosis, treatment, and precision medicine in respiratory diseases.">

Using extensively trained nuclear and membrane segmentation models, we achieved precise transcript assignment and deep learning–based image analysis. To address read-depth limitations, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing with single-cell spatial transcriptomics from the same sample. Quantifying cell-cell distances at the edge level enabled more accurate tumor microenvironment analysis, revealing global and local immune cell enrichment near leukemia cells postpembrolizumab treatment, potentially linked to clinical response. Furthermore, ligand-receptor analysis indicated potential alterations in specific signaling pathways between leukemia and immune cells following immunotherapy treatment.

        <tr id="Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is emerging as a powerful technology that transforms our understanding of thyroid cancer by offering a spatial context of gene expression within the tumor tissue. In this review, we synthesize the recent applications of ST in thyroid cancer research, with a particular focus on the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment, tumor evolution, and cellular interactions. Studies have leveraged the spatial information provided by ST to map distinct cell types and expression patterns of genes and pathways across the different regions of thyroid cancer samples. The spatial context also allows a closer examination of invasion and metastasis, especially through the dysregulation at the tumor leading edge. Additionally, signaling pathways are inferred at a more accurate level through the spatial proximity of ligands and receptors. We also discuss the limitations that need to be overcome, including technical limitations like low resolution and sequencing depth, the need for high-quality samples, and complex data handling processes, and suggest future directions for a wider and more efficient application of ST in advancing personalized treatment of thyroid cancer.">

        <tr id="Intratumor heterogeneity arises from ongoing somatic evolution complicating cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Here we present TEATIME (estimating evolutionary events through single-timepoint sequencing), a novel computational framework that models tumors as mixtures of two competing cell populations: an ancestral clone with baseline fitness and a derived subclone with elevated fitness. Using cross-sectional bulk sequencing data, TEATIME estimates mutation rates, timing of subclone emergence, relative fitness, and number of generations of growth. To quantify intratumor fitness asymmetries, we introduce a novel metric—fitness diversity—which captures the imbalance between competing cell populations and serves as a measure of functional intratumor heterogeneity. Applying TEATIME to 33 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we revealed divergent as well as convergent evolutionary patterns. Notably, we found that immune-hot microenvironments constraint subclonal expansion and limit fitness diversity. Moreover, we detected temporal dependencies in mutation acquisition, where early driver mutations in ancestral clones epistatically shape the fitness landscape, predisposing specific subclones to selective advantages. These findings underscore the importance of intratumor competition and tumor-microenvironment interactions in shaping evolutionary trajectories, driving intratumor heterogeneity. Lastly, we demonstrate that TEATIME-derived evolutionary parameters and fitness diversity offer novel prognostic insights across multiple cancer types.">

 Background:
 Understanding cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is essential for elucidating disease progression and advancing immunotherapy. The TME is a complex ecosystem composed of cells with dysregulated metabolism immune response and signaling pathways, which in turn influence tumor development and treatment response. Multiplexed assessment serves as an important tool for clinical oncology. The simultaneous readout of multiple processes can provide biological insights and elucidate disease mechanism. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) is a spatial biology imaging technique that utilizes CyTOF technology and enables deep characterization of the diversity and complexity of the TME. IMC technology offers scalable, high-throughput acquisition while generating high-quality data with true dynamic range of signal without amplification or fluorescence-based limitations such as spectral overlap and autofluorescence.
 Methods:
 To study cellular processes and their roles in tumor progression, we utilized the Human Cell Metabolism and Human Cell Signaling Panels to investigate energy production, cellular homeostasis and mitogenic signaling pathways. We then mapped these processes to the types of cells in the TME by using the Human Immuno-Oncology IMC Panel and the Human T Cell Exhaustion IMC Panel or the Maxpar Neuro Phenotyping IMC Panel Kit to characterize immune cell and neurological phenotypes in detail. We first acquired data using Preview Mode to assess the whole tissue, followed by higher-resolution imaging of selected regions of interest using Cell Mode or of the whole tissue section using Tissue Mode.
 Results:
 Our data analysis revealed significant insights into the spatial organization and metabolic profile of cells across cancer tissues. Elevated glycolysis and mTOR pathway activation suggested adaptations to hypoxia and anabolic growth in tumor areas, while interactions between fibroblasts and immune cells highlighted crosstalk within the TME. Our Neuro Phenotyping Panel was used to reveal potential for immune response in glioblastoma. Unsupervised pixel clustering and hierarchical clustering using MCD SmartViewer highlighted metabolic activity and activation of signaling pathways within tumor regions.
 Conclusions:
 Comprehensive spatial biology profiling using the IMC approach highlights the interconnected roles these pathways play in promoting tumor survival and resistance to therapies. These findings, which illuminate the metabolic and signaling heterogeneity of the TME, are crucial for developing future prognostic assessments and have the potential to guide more effective, personalized cancer therapies.

        <tr id="Solid cancers are complex 'ecosystems' comprised of diverse cell types and extracellular molecules, where heterotypic interactions significantly influence disease etiology and therapeutic response. However, our current understanding of tumor microenvironments (TMEs) remains incomplete, hindering the development and implementation of novel TME-targeted drugs. To maximize cancer therapeutic development we require a systems-level understanding of the malignant, stromal, and immune states that define the tumor and determine treatment response. In their recent study, Liu and colleagues took a new approach to resolving the complexity of stromal heterogeneity. They leveraged extensive single-cell spatial multi-omics datasets across various cancer types and platforms to identify four conserved spatial Cancer-Associated Fibroblast (CAF) subtypes, classified by their spatial organization and cellular neighborhoods. Their work expands upon prior efforts to develop a CAF taxonomy, which primarily relied on single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and yielded a multitude of classification systems. This study advances our understanding of CAF biology by establishing a link between spatial context and CAF identity across diverse tumor types. Departing from recent single-cell transcriptomics studies that employed a marker-based approach for sub-state identification, Liu and colleagues conducted de novo discovery of CAF subtypes using spatial neighborhood information alone. By positioning spatial organization as the defining axis of CAF heterogeneity, this research redefines CAF classification and provides a new framework for exploring the rules governing tumor ecosystems and developing novel ecosystem-based therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Lymphomas are highly heterogeneous malignancies characterized by diverse genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic profiles, which complicate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Traditional bulk sequencing methods mask the complexity of intratumoral variation, often overlooking rare subclones that may drive disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Single-cell genomics has emerged as a transformative approach to decipher tumor heterogeneity at unprecedented resolution. This technology enables the dissection of individual cellular populations within lymphomas, offering insights into clonal evolution, transcriptional diversity, and microenvironmental interactions. By applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), chromatin accessibility assays (scATAC-seq), and single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq), researchers can unravel lineage relationships, identify resistant subpopulations, and track dynamic changes in response to therapy. In lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), single-cell approaches have revealed distinct malignant and non-malignant cell states that correlate with treatment outcomes. Moreover, integrating single-cell data with spatial transcriptomics and immune profiling enhances the understanding of the tumor microenvironment, including immune evasion mechanisms. These insights can inform personalized treatment strategies, identify novel therapeutic targets, and enable early detection of relapse. Despite technical challenges such as data complexity, sample viability, and cost, the application of single-cell genomics in lymphoma research is rapidly advancing. Future directions include multi-omics integration, real-time patient monitoring, and clinical translation of predictive biomarkers.

        <tr id="Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with extremely poor prognosis. SCLC cells exhibit high plasticity and can progress from neuroendocrine (NE) to non-NE phenotypes. This dynamic evolution promotes treatment resistance and relapses, representing a challenge for targeted therapies in this elusive disease. Here we identify the transcription factor ONECUT2 (OC2) as a driver of plasticity in SCLC, leading to non-NE transcriptional states. OC2 is highly expressed in SCLC tumors compared to normal lung tissue and its expression is associated with heightened clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. We show that OC2 is a repressor of ASCL1, the NE master regulator transcription factor. In addition, OC2 upregulates non-NE programs through activation of c-MYC and Notch signaling. We also demonstrate that OC2 is required for growth and survival of SCLC cells and that it can be targeted with a small molecule inhibitor that acts synergistically with the standard combination of cisplatin and etoposide, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for OC2 active SCLC tumors.

As metastatic lesions develop, the unique milieu of the brain microenvironment shapes disease progression and therapeutic response. Among resident brain cells, astrocytes are both the most common, and are increasingly recognized as key regulators of this process, yet their precise role remains poorly defined. Here, we present a hybrid agent-based model (ABM) to simulate tumor–astrocyte interactions on a two-dimensional lattice. In our model, metastatic tumor cells induce phenotypic reprogramming of astrocytes from an antito a pro-metastatic state, thereby enhancing tumor proliferation. We systematically evaluate how variations in astrocyte density, spatial distribution, and chemotherapy impact tumor expansion and spatial morphology, quantified by fractal dimension, lacunarity, and eccentricity. Our simulations reveal that astrocyte reprogramming accelerates tumor progression and contributes to increased morphological complexity and chemotherapeutic resistance.">

        <tr id="Organotropism results from the functional versatility of metastatic cancer cells to survive and proliferate in diverse microenvironments. This adaptivity can originate in clonal variation of the spreading tumor and is often empowered by epigenetic and molecular reprogramming of cell regulatory circuits. Related to organotropic colonization of metastatic sites are environmentally-sensitive, differential responses of cancer cells to therapeutic attack. Accordingly, understanding the organotropic profile of a cancer and probing the underlying driver mechanisms are of high clinical importance. However, determining systematically the organotropism of one cancer versus the organotropism of another cancer, potentially with the granularity of comparing the same cancer type between patients or tracking the evolution of a cancer in a single patient for the purpose of personalized treatment, has remained very challenging. It requires a host organism that allows observation of the spreading pattern over relatively short experimental times. Moreover, organotropic patterns often tend to be statistically weak and superimposed by experimental variation. Thus, an assay for organotropism must give access to statistical powers that can separate ‘meaningful heterogeneity’, i.e., heterogeneity that determines organotropism, from ‘meaningless heterogeneity’, i.e., heterogeneity that causes experimental noise. Here we describe an experimental workflow that leverages the physiological properties of zebrafish larvae for an imaging-based assessment of organotropic patterns over a time-frame of 3 days. The workflow incorporates computer vision pipelines to automatically integrate the stochastic spreading behavior of a particular cancer xenograft in tens to hundreds of larvae allowing subtle trends in the colonization of particular organs to emerge above random cell depositions throughout the host organism. We validate our approach with positive control experiments comparing the spreading patterns of a metastatic sarcoma against non-transformed fibroblasts and the spreading patterns of two melanoma cell lines with previously established differences in metastatic propensity. We then show that integration of the spreading pattern of xenografts in 40 – 50 larvae is necessary and sufficient to generate a Fish Metastatic Atlas page that is representative of the organotropism of a particular oncogenotype and experimental condition. Finally, we apply the power of this assay to determine the function of the EWSR1::FLI1 fusion oncogene and its transcriptional target SOX6 as plasticity factors that enhance the adaptive capacity of metastatic Ewing sarcoma.">

        <tr id="Uveal melanoma (UM) is a highly aggressive intraocular malignancy with limited therapeutic options for metastatic disease. Existing transgenic UM mouse models inadequately recapitulate human disease progression, while transplant models lack immune competence for studying the tumor immune microenvironment and therapeutic interventions. To address these limitations, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model incorporating stepwise genetic alterations implicated in human UM progression. Spatiotemporally controlled expression of mutant GNAQQ209L from the endogenous locus induced choroidal nevi with limited penetrance. Concomitant BAP1 deletion enhanced nevus formation, while further MYC activation led to fully penetrant intraocular tumors with metastatic potential. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed malignant cells segregated into Melanocytic and Neural Crest-like subpopulations characterized by distinct transcriptional and biosynthetic programs. Trajectory analyses inferred dedifferentiation from the Melanocytic toward the Neural Crest-like state during tumor progression. Comparison to human UM revealed commonalities with highly aggressive Class 2 UM, including gene expression signatures and copy number gains affecting genes that map to human chromosome 8q beyond the activated MYC allele, suggesting cooperative effects of multiple drivers in this chromosomal region. The tumor microenvironment featured immunosuppressive macrophage populations and exhausted T cells, closely resembling human UM. This physiologically relevant, immune-competent model provides a platform for investigating UM biology, functionally characterizing candidate driver genes, and developing immune-based therapeutic strategies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We developed a mouse model that resembles the genetic progression and phenotypic plasticity of human UM. This spatially controlled model confirms the critical role of driver mutations in GNAQ and BAP1, proposes MYC as a promoter of malignant transformation in coordination with other chromosome 8q genes, and reveals UM progression through distinct cellular states. This model offers an urgently needed preclinical platform for understanding the immunogenomics of UM and for testing immune and targeted treatments for this lethal cancer.">

        <tr id="The most common cause of death in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a deadly sarcoma that can transform from benign plexiform neurofibromas (PN) or premalignant atypical neurofibromas (AN). We built a single-cell dataset of 55 NF1-associated PN, AN, and MPNST to define cellular changes in neurofibroma at-risk of malignant transformation. Integrative analysis of changes in the tumor microenvironment revealed the emergence of malignant tumor cells, regulatory T cells, and loss of activated macrophages in MPNST. Using this reference dataset, we validated findings using anchor-based label transfer in an additional 19 NF1 nerve sheath tumors profiled with single cell sequencing, and public datasets. We then defined protein biomarkers of malignant transformation from high-throughput proteomic analysis of plasma samples collected from 45 NF1 patients that correlated to mRNAs specific to MPNST cell populations. Fifty plasma proteins accurately and non-invasively distinguished patients with MPNST from those with premalignant tumors. These markers should improve the ability to identify high-risk neurofibromas for improved cancer surveillance and enable early detection of malignant transformation in NF1.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancers for humans. HCC is highly heterogeneous. In this study, we performed ultra-depth (∼1 million reads per spot) sequencing of 6,320 spatial transcriptomes on a case of HCC. Sixteen distinct spatial expression clusters were identified. Each of these clusters was spatially contiguous and had distinct gene expression patterns. In contrast, benign liver tissues showed minimal heterogeneity in terms of gene expression. Numerous immune cell-enriched spots were identified in both HCC and benign liver regions. Cells adjacent to these immune cell-enriched spots showed significant alterations in their gene expression patterns. Interestingly, the responses of HCC cells to the nearby immune cells were significantly more intense and broader, while the responses of benign liver cells to immune cells were somewhat narrow and muted, suggesting an innate difference in immune cell activities towards HCC cells in comparison with benign liver cells. However, cell-cell interaction analyses showed significant immune evasion by HCC cancer cells. When standard-depth sequencing was performed, significant numbers of genes and pathways that were associated with these changes disappeared. Qualitative differences in some pathways were also found. These results suggest that deep spatial sequencing may help to uncover previously unidentified mechanisms of liver cancer development.">

 Background:
 Racial and ethnic disparities in breast cancer mortality persist across breast cancer subtypes, and variations in immune response may contribute. Single-cell spatial profiling enables detailed insights into the tumor microenvironment.
 Methods:
 We leveraged a cohort of young, racially and ethnically diverse women enrolled from 1995-2005 in the population-based Northern California Breast Cancer Family Registry (NC-BCFR). We determined feasibility of imaging-based spatial profiling on NC-BCFR TMAs with CosMx 6K SMI single-cell spatial transcriptomics assay, evaluating 140 samples from 88 women. Cells were stained with nuclear and membrane markers, imaged, and segmented with internal algorithms. Cell-level transcriptomic data of 6519 genes were normalized across the TMA and integrated with SCTransform. Manual cell typing was performed using publicly available annotations. Cell type composition for each sample for immune, fibroblast, cancer epithelium, and normal epithelium, normalized to 100 tumor cells/sample, was validated using predictions from matched H&E stained slides annotated with the HoverNet deep learning algorithm. Spatial transcriptomics data were used to predict HER2 and hormone status (HR). The immune microenvironment was examined across race, ethnicity and breast cancer subtype.
 Results:
 Race and ethnicity of 88 NC-BCFR participants were as follows: 16 Black, 22 Asian, 34 Hispanic, and 16 non-Hispanic (NH) White women. Profiles revealed 917,804 cells with mean transcript per cell of 838 (range: 517-1141). Following QC, normalization, and integration, 867,237 cells were typed across diverse phenotypes. With cell type normalized to 100 tumor cells/sample, there was a trend toward NH White samples having increased immune infiltrate vs. other racial groups, within both SMI (NH White 158, Black 116, Hispanic 89, Asian 55.3; ANOVA p = 0.263) and HoverNet (NH White 40.2, Black 24.9, Asian 29.1, Hispanic 18.9; ANOVA p = 0.117). Samples from NH White women had higher B-cell infiltrates (ANOVA p = 0.165) and macrophage content (ANOVA p = 0.000753) compared to cores from Asian, Black, and Hispanic women. Similar trends were observed in NK-cells (ANOVA p = 0.643) and T-cell infiltrates (ANOVA p = 0.318), and tertiary lymphoid structures were identified in one sample.
 Conclusions:
 Single-cell spatial transcriptomics can characterize the tumor immune microenvironment in TMAs from the 1990s, thus leveraging a highly diverse, population-based cohort study with long-term follow-up for novel, clinically relevant discoveries.

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors have greatly improved outcomes in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC have a poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Emerging evidence suggests that an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment plays an important role in this setting, however, we still lack fundamental knowledge about tumor endothelial cell biology. We hypothesized that oncogene specific changes in the expression of immune-related genes in tumor endothelial cells account for differences in the tumor microenvironment and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
 Methods:
 We utilized spatial transcriptomics (GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling) on resected tumor tissue of EGFR mutant (n = 5) and KRAS mutant (n = 5) NSCLC patients to investigate the transcriptional signature of tumor, endothelial and stromal cells. Additionally, we used NicheNet to explore intercellular communication between tumor, endothelial, and stromal cells. Immune gene set enrichment analysis scores were calculated using ESTIMATE. Immune cell type proportions were estimated using CIBERSORT.
 Results:
 Using spatial transcriptomics, we dissected the tumor microenvironment into tumor, stromal and endothelial compartments. By analyzing predicted cellular communication, we found that tumor and stromal cells primarily affect an interferon-related gene signature in tumor endothelial cells. Notable differentially expressed interferon-related genes, that were significantly up-regulated in KRAS mutant and down-regulated in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients, included CXCL9, STAT1, WARS1, IRF1 and ICAM1. In the stromal compartment, immune gene set enrichment analysis scores were significantly lower in EGFR mutant than KRAS mutant NSCLC (median, 355 vs. 713, P = 0.026) indicating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We observed substantial heterogeneity while exploring the cellular landscape of the stromal compartment in EGFR mutant and KRAS mutant NSCLC. Notably, we found a significantly decreased proportion of pro-inflammatory macrophages in the stromal compartment of EGFR compared to KRAS mutant NSCLC (P = 0.006).
 Conclusions:
 We identified distinct interferon-related gene signatures in tumor endothelial cells of patients with EGFR and KRAS mutantNSCLC associated with variations in the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment. This may provide a better understanding for the development of spatial biomarkers to identify which oncogene-driven NSCLC patients are most likely to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

        <tr id="The complex interplay between tumor cells and clusters with endothelial tissues during metastasis, in particular with regard to the exosomes in mediating intercellular communication, is still not well understood. Here, we develop a tumoral-transendothelial migration model to replicate the microenvironment of circulating tumor cells infiltrating blood vessels during metastasis. We propose an exosome-integrated approach combining a tumoral-transendothelial migration chip (TEMOC) with machine learning (ML) to enable the simulation and prediction of exosome-mediated invasion into the endothelial layer at both the single-cell and cluster levels. Leveraging a microfluidic trap array and the inherent self-organizing properties of cells, we conducted high-throughput studies on 121 specific tumor microenvironments on a chip. We uncovered the impact of exosomes derived from highly metastatic breast cancer on individual breast cancer cells and clusters: exosomes disrupt the adhesive matrix between endothelial cells and enhance tumor cell invasion. Additionally, highly metastatic cell-derived exosomes were found to stimulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in low-metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF-7), thereby promoting metastasis. An ML algorithm, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), was subsequently utilized to evaluate the correlation between multiple biomarkers on tumor cells and tumor invasion capability. The optimized biomarker combination strategy achieved a prediction accuracy of 93.5%. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which exosomes derived from highly metastatic breast cancer cells induce metastasis. Furthermore, the combined use of the TEMOC and ML approach offers a platform for exploring the mechanisms of exosome-mediated tumor-vascular invasion and accelerating anti-metastatic therapeutic discovery.">

Linked measurements reveal that buoyant mass and stiffness characterize B-cell development states from naïve to plasma cell and correlate with expression of oncogenic B-cell receptor signaling genes such as BLK and CD79A. Additionally, changes in cell buoyant mass within primary patient specimens ex vivo correlate with sensitivity to Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors in vivo in MCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, another B-cell malignancy.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, characterized by tumor and nontumor cells at various cell states. Ecotyper is an innovative machine learning framework that quantifies the tumor microenvironment and delineates the tumor ecosystem, demonstrating clinical significance. However, further validation is needed in breast cancer. Methods Ecotyper was applied to identify multiple cellular states and tumor ecotypes using large‐scale breast cancer bulk sequencing data, followed by a detailed analysis of their associations with clinical classification, molecular subtypes, survival prognosis, and immunotherapy response. Identified subtypes were further characterized using single‐cell and spatial data sets to reveal molecular profiles. Results In a comprehensive analysis of 6578 breast cancer samples from four data sets, Ecotyper identified 69 cellular states and 10 tumor ecotypes. Of these, 37 cellular states significantly correlated with overall survival. Notably, specific states within epithelial cells, macrophages/monocytes, and fibroblasts were linked to a worse prognosis. CE2 abundance was identified as the most significant marker indicating unfavorable prognosis and was further validated in an additional data set of 116 HER2‐negative patients. These biomarkers also indicated the efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in breast cancer. CE2‐high cancers were characterized by an abundance of basal‐like epithelial cells, scant lymphocytic infiltration, and activation of hypoxia signaling. Single‐cell analysis showed that CE2‐high areas were rich in SPP1‐positive tumor‐associated macrophages(TAM), basal‐like epithelial cells, and hypoxic cancer‐associated fibroblasts(CAF). Spatially, these regions were often peripheral in triple‐negative breast cancer, adjacent to fibrotic/necrotic zones. Multiplex immunofluorescence confirmed the enrichment of SPP1+CD68+TAM and HIF1A+SMA+CAF in hypoxic triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) regions. Conclusions Ecotyper identified novel biomarkers for breast cancer prognosis and treatment prediction. The CE2‐high region may represent a hypoxic immune‐suppressive niche.">

        <tr id="While cervical cancer (CC) prognosis depends on tumor staging, the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity during metastatic progression remains poorly characterized at single-cell resolution. We employed an integrative multi-omics approach, combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq; n = 11), spatial transcriptomics (ST), and bulk RNA-seq data from the TCGA-CESC cohort (n = 304), to systematically map TME remodeling across CC progression stages. scRNA-seq was performed on primary lesions from patients with localized (n = 3), regional (n = 4), and metastatic (n = 4) diseases, with in-depth analyses focusing on cellular characteristics, cell type composition alterations, functional changes, differentiation trajectories, and cell-cell interaction networks. These findings were further validated using spatial transcriptomics, bulk RNA-seq data, and multiple immunohistochemistry (mIHC) experiments. ScRNA-seq data revealed that the TME of the metastatic group displayed a distinct immunosuppressive phenotype. Three key subclusters closely linked to TME remodeling in this group were identified. Notably, a novel metastasis-associated epithelial subpopulation (Epi0_AGR2), characterized by both epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemokine secretory phenotypes, was discovered. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) revealed that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling activation served as its primary transcriptional driver. Additionally, a neutrophil subset with pro-tumor and immunosuppressive properties, as well as a cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) subset that promoted angiogenesis, were enriched in the metastatic group. Cell-cell interaction analysis and spatial mapping further revealed the formation of coordinated Epi0-neutrophil-CAFs niches, which established TGF-β-CXCL1/2/8-OSM/OSMR feedforward loops. Importantly, a computational model derived from the TME metastatic niche signature demonstrated significant prognostic stratification in the TCGA cohort (HR = 2.5179, p = 0.0144). In all, this study provides the first comprehensive delineation of stage-specific TME dynamics in CC, revealing TGF-β-driven cellular cooperativity as a metastatic switch. The joint framework establishes a potential clinically translatable tool for precision prognosis and therapeutic targeting.">

        <tr id="Presented here is an emerging DNA-barcode-based multiplex imaging technique based on Co-Detection-by-indEXing that analyzes the spatial proteomics of tissue microenvironments. Successful imaging requires a repertoire of well-designed and properly validated antibody panels, but very few currently exist for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. FFPE offers several advantages over fresh-frozen specimens, such as widespread availability, ease of handling and storage, and the ability to make tissue microarrays (TMAs). Here, we present a protocol to develop an antibody panel for visualizing and analyzing FFPE tissues from a murine melanoma model treated with nanoparticles, which deliver plasmid DNA encoding immunologic signals for tumor microenvironment reprogramming. We also describe an image analysis pipeline using open-source computational tools for annotating tissues, segmenting cells, processing proteomics data, phenotyping cell populations, and quantifying spatial metrics. The protocol offers applications for designing antibody panels in murine FFPE and generating novel insights into the spatial proteomics of complex tissue microenvironments.">

        <tr id="Background Metastatic hormone-naïve prostate cancer (mHNPC) is an infrequent form of this tumor type that is characterized by metastasis at the time of diagnosis and accounts for up to 50% of prostate cancer-related deaths. Despite the extensive characterization of localized and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the molecular characteristics of mHNPC remain largely unexplored. Results Here, we provide the first extensive transcriptomics characterization of primary tumor specimens from patients with mHNPC. We generate discovery and validation bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets and perform integrative computational analysis in combination with experimental studies. Our results provide unprecedented evidence of the distinctive transcriptional profile of mHNPC and identify stroma remodeling as a predominant feature of these tumors. Importantly, we discover a central role for the SRY-box transcription factor 11 (SOX11) in triggering a heterotypic communication that is associated with the acquisition of metastatic properties. Conclusions Our study will constitute an invaluable resource for a profound understanding of mHNPC that can influence patient management.

        <tr id="In colorectal cancer (CRC), tumor buds (TB) are observed histologically as single tumor cell or small tumor cell clusters located mainly at the advancing tumor edge. TB are a marker of poor prognosis and correlate with metastatic disease in CRC patients. They often lack expression of CDX2 and overexpress markers involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We evaluated the function of CDX2 in CRC proliferation and migration using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and demonstrated a possible link to tumor dissociation and tumor budding. Knocking out CDX2 in CRC cell lines significantly increased migration. Importantly, the observed phenotypes could be rescued by re-expressing CDX2 and by specific CRISPR synergistic activation mediator (SAM) of endogenous CDX2 in CDX2 low expressing CRC cell lines. Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) analysis of primary tumor regions compared to TB in a CDX2-positive CRC patient sample as well as patient derived xenografts (PDX) revealed significantly lower CDX2 expression and correlating E-cadherin levels in TB compared to primary tumor regions, in both models. Accordingly, increased invasiveness of CRC CDX2 knockout cells was seen in ex ovo xenografts. Taken together, our results provide further insight into the function of CDX2 in preventing CRC cell migration, tumor budding and tumor aggressiveness.">

        <tr id="Abstract The tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly influences cancer prognosis and therapeutic outcomes, yet its composition remains highly heterogeneous, and currently, no highly accessible, high‐throughput method exists to define it. To address this complexity, the TMEclassifier, a machine‐learning tool that classifies cancers into three distinct subtypes: immune Exclusive (IE), immune Suppressive (IS), and immune Activated (IA), is developed. Bulk RNA sequencing categorizes patient samples by TME subtype, and in vivo mouse model validates TME subtype differences and differential responses to immunotherapy. The IE subtype is marked by high stromal cell abundance, associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes. The IS subtype features myeloid‐derived suppressor cell infiltration, intensifying immunosuppression. In contrast, the IA subtype, often linked to EBV/MSI, exhibits robust T‐cell presence and improved immunotherapy response. Single‐cell RNA sequencing is applied to explore TME cellular heterogeneity, and in vivo experiments demonstrate that targeting IL‐1 counteracts immunosuppression of IS subtype and markedly improves its responsiveness to immunotherapy. TMEclassifier predictions are validated in this prospective gastric cancer cohort (TIMES‐001) and other diverse cohorts. This classifier could effectively stratify patients, guiding personalized immunotherapeutic strategies to enhance precision and overcome resistance.">

        <tr id="Melanomas are genetically heterogeneous, displaying mitogen-activated protein kinase mutations and homozygous loss of tumor suppressor genes. Mouse models combining such mutations produce fast-growing tumors. In contrast, rare, slow-growing tumors arise in mice combining Braf activation with heterozygous loss of Pten. Here we show that similar tumors can arise in albino mice bearing only a Braf mutation. Incidence kinetics suggest a stochastic event underlies tumorigenesis in tumors that arise with only a Braf mutation, yet de novo mutations or structural variants that could explain the incidence of most tumors could not be found. Single-cell transcriptomics of tumors identify a cell type resembling “neural crest-like” cells in human and mouse melanomas. These exist in normal mouse skin, expand upon Braf activation, and persist through serial transplantation; analyses of gene expression suggest they serve as precursors of malignant cells. This state may serve as an intermediate on a slow path to malignancy that may provide a diagnostically and therapeutically important source of cellular heterogeneity.">

        <tr id="Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks targeted therapies, leading to a poor prognosis. Younger patients with TNBC often present with aggressive disease and exhibit distinct tumor microenvironments (TME). We performed spatial profiling to understand the influence of menopausal status on the immune environment, tumor progression, and therapy response. Methods Eleven treatment-naive TNBC tumors were examined in epithelial and non-epithelial areas using digital spatial profiling to identify differentially expressed markers and pathways. Deconvolution methods were employed to identify immune cell subtypes, and the protein expression of T and B cells was confirmed. The prognostic utility of the identified genes and pathways was validated using the METABRIC and SCAN-B datasets. The expression of target genes was analyzed in the I-SPY 2 trial data to understand their influence on the response to specific therapies. Results Premenopausal tumors formed a distinct cluster characterized by the upregulation of cell activation and antigen presentation pathways. In contrast, T cell checkpoint, cancer antigen, and PI3K-AKT pathways were downregulated. External datasets validated these findings, showing a lower hazard and better prognosis for genes upregulated in premenopausal tumors. An enrichment of CD8 + T cells, endothelial cells, and monocytes was observed, along with increased intratumoral protein expression of CD8, CD4, and CD20. Premenopausal tumors demonstrated better responses to PARP and HSP90 inhibitors but showed lower sensitivity to Pembrolizumab and PI3K-AKT inhibitors compared to postmenopausal tumors in the I-SPY 2 trial data. Conclusion Our study underscores the importance of menopausal status in shaping the TME within TNBC, revealing distinct immune landscapes and therapy responses. These findings highlight the need for larger prospective studies to validate differential treatment strategies in younger patients.

 Background:
 The tumor microenvironment (TME) of primary breast tumors (PTs) and breast-to-liver metastases shows heterogeneous infiltration and interactions between tumor, immune, and stromal cells. Hepatic metastases exhibit a more immunosuppressive TME with fewer cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) relative to PTs, which may contribute to increased tumor growth and resistance to systemic therapies. To investigate the immune cell infiltration and immune-tumor interactions in PT and liver metastases, we utilized whole transcriptome analysis and immunofluorescence-based protein expression as part of spatial TME profiling.
 Methods:
 We identified 13 chemo-naïve PTs and 3 breast-to-liver metastases. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were used for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and spatial transcriptomics (ST) profiling with the 10X Genomics Visium CytAssist and Visium HD platforms. The H&E slides were manually annotated in collaboration with a board-certified pathologist, and ST data were deconvoluted using breast-specific scRNA-sequenced references and canonical marker labeling.
 Results:
 Our analysis of the 13 PTs and 3 breast-to-liver metastases revealed significant heterogeneity in tumor clusters, immune cell infiltration, gene set enrichments, and gene signatures between primary and visceral TMEs. Unsupervised clustering of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) HER2-negative (HER2) samples demonstrated considerable intratumoral and intertumoral variability, with differences in the expression of tumor markers (EPCAM, ER, PR, ERBB2, KRT14, KRT18), hypoxia-related signatures (HIF1a), and pro-angiogenic drivers (VEGF). Breast-to-liver metastases showed higher expression of pathways involved in proliferation, angiogenesis, and anti-apoptosis compared to primary tumors. Hepatic metastases were enriched for HALLMARK gene sets related to proliferation and metabolic pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, mTORC1 signaling, E2F targets, MYC targets, G2M checkpoint, mitotic spindle, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid metabolism when compared to primary tumors. In contrast, primary tumors were enriched for immune-related pathways (TNF-α, interferon-γ, inflammatory response, IL-6 JAK/STAT3), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), myogenesis, and angiogenesis gene signatures, which are consistent with their metastatic potential. Cellular profiling of liver lesions revealed higher myeloid suppressor cells (TAMs and MDSCs): CD8
 +
 ratio with shorter cell-cell distances relative to PTs suggesting a key role in immune evasion, tumor progression, and therapeutic resistance.
 Conclusions:
 ST data from primary and metastatic breast cancer samples revealed notable tumor heterogeneity, characterized by highly active metabolic and proliferative pathways, along with a higher abundance of myeloid cells.

        <tr id="Resistance to chemotherapy of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is largely driven by intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) due to tumor cell plasticity and clonal diversity. In order to develop novel strategies to overcome this defined mechanism of resistance, tools to monitor and quantify ITH in a rapid and scalable fashion are needed urgently. Here, we employed label-free digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to characterize ITH in PDAC. We established a robust experimental and machine learning analysis pipeline to perform single cell phenotyping based on DHM-derived phase images of PDAC cells in suspension. Importantly, we are able to detect dynamic changes in tumor cell differentiation and heterogeneity of distinct PDAC subtypes upon induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and under treatment-imposed pressure in murine and patient-derived model systems. This platform allows us to assess phenotypic ITH in PDAC on a single cell level in real-time. Implementing this technology into the clinical workflow has the potential to fundamentally increase our understanding of tumor heterogeneity during evolution and treatment response.">

        <tr id="Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) can lead to metastasis and high mortality rates known for its aggressive and invasive properties. Currently, primary treatment options of surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy have many therapeutic limitations for OSCC patients due to its dynamic evolutionary pathways and the development of resistance to conventional therapies. Moreover, previous studies fail to emphasize the roles of cellular heterogeneity, drug resistance, and evolutionary trajectories in OSCC. This review explores the intricate tumor microenvironment landscape of OSCC, focusing on the cellular heterogeneity, drug resistance, and evolutionary trajectories as well as genetic, epigenetic, and environmental risk factors contributing to the OSCC progression. Tumor heterogeneity arises from environmental exposures (e.g., tobacco, HPV infection, dietary carcinogens) that drive clonal evolution, creating subpopulations of cells with distinct mutational profiles and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Recent advances in in the precision medicine and combination therapy of OSCC paves the way for innovative therapeutic strategies, such as targeting molecular subclones through real-time monitoring and leveraging computational models to predict treatment response. By recognizing tumor heterogeneity as both a driver of therapeutic resistance and a therapeutic target, precision medicine frameworks can integrate environmental risk factor data, molecular profiling, and early detection tools to optimize outcomes. This review underscores the necessity for a multidisciplinary approach to understand and combat the complexity of OSCC, proposing directions for future research to enhance diagnosis and treatment efficacy. Graphical Abstract This review highlights how research into cellular heterogeneity, drug resistance, and evolutionary trajectories in oral squamous cell carcinoma is revolutionizing our understanding and treatment of the disease, emphasizing personalized approaches that could significantly enhance patient care in oncology.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a lethal lung malignancy and patients are often diagnosed with distant metastasis. Nearly all patients suffer from disease relapsing with inherent chemoresistance. Lack of targeted SCLC therapies further worsens disease outcomes, making it highly desirable to identify novel and effective therapeutic targets. Methods To search for potential therapeutic targets in SCLC, we analyzed publicly available single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from normal, lung adenocarcinoma, and SCLC tumor tissues. To assess the targeting potential of FOXM1, we developed various in vitro models, including DOX-On-shFOXM1 (Tet-ON) inducible stable knockdown systems. Cisplatin resistant human and murine SCLC cell lines were generated to assess the role of FOXM1 in chemotherapy resistance. Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immuno-fluorescence were used to analyze the expression of FOXM1 and target proteins. ChIP-assay was used to study protein-gene interactions. Further, multicolor flow cytometry was employed to study the effect of FOXM1 inhibition on human T cells activation and differentiation. Subcutaneous xenograft and SCLC spontaneous (RPM: RB fl/fl ; TP53 fl/fl ; LSL-MYC T58A ) mouse models were used to evaluate the efficacy of FOXM1 inhibitors. Results Single-cell as well as bulk RNA-seq data revealed that FOXM1, an oncogenic transcription factor, is overexpressed in SCLC, and it was recapitulated in human and murine SCLC tissues and cell lines. Interestingly, chemo-resistant (CR) SCLC showed a substantially higher FOXM1 expression than naïve SCLC. Silencing FOXM1 genetically or pharmacologically by FOXM1 inhibitors revealed a marked reduction in cell viability, colony formation, migration and sphere formation in naïve and CR SCLC cells. Moreover, FOXM1 inhibition induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in SCLC cells. Furthermore, FOXM1 inhibition in combination with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy showed synergistic anticancer effects in both xenograft and RPM mouse models of SCLC. Our RNA-seq analysis revealed that FOXM1 inhibition altered the Aurora Kinase B (AURKB) signaling pathway, which is dysregulated in SCLC. Moreover, we found FOXM1 inhibition enhanced T cell activation and supported the differentiation of CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, and T cell-mediated killing of cancer cells. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that FOXM1 targeting using small molecule inhibitors has the potential to be a novel therapeutic strategy to combat SCLC progression including chemotherapeutic resistance and reshaping the anti-tumor immune response.">

 Background:
 Tumoral heterogeneity has been widely acknowledged to influence clinical outcome of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). This study investigated spatial gene profiling of different pathological subtypes of early-stage invasive LUAD with Stereo-seq transcriptomics technique. The tumor microenvironment (TME) was decoded with cellular and molecular events at perspectives of tumoral activities and immune activities.
 Methods:
 We collected spatial RNA profiles of nine Stereo-seq chips (captured area of 1 x1 cm) from 4 invasive LUAD patients. Pathologist identified histological subtypes including lepidic adenocarcinoma (LP), acinar adenocarcinoma (AC) and other invasive adenocarcinoma like papillary adenocarcinoma (IA) on adjacent H&E images. Spatial data matrix was obtained based on pathological annotation accordingly. Spatially resolved gene expression of each subtypes was obtain based on pathological annotation to conduct high resolution analyses. TME functional units were calculated by analysis of cellular neighborhoods (CNs) based on cell compositions within resolution of bin 100 (window of 50um x 50um). Sub-populations of tumoral cells were stratified by molecular functions (GSEA and GSVA score) and stemness (CytoTRACE).
 Results:
 All pathological subtypes shared the identical 10 heterogeneous CNs and 5 tumoral clusters (TM) with various propotions. Tumor cluster 0 (TM0) and TM3 were identified as the malignant population with significant high stemness and significant high activities of MTORC1 signaling, TGF-BETA signaling, PI3K-ATK signaling and hypoxia. AC and IA were mainly composed of TM0 and TM3. Compared to TM0, TM3 had higher EMT activity. We further identified two immune-related CNs (CN4 and CN8) with significant high GSVA score of Interferon-Alpha response, Interferon-Gamma response and Inflammatory response. Spatial association showed that the lymphoid-cells-dominated CN4 was enriched in LP and IA and nearly absent in AC. Meanwhile, the myeloid-cells-dominated CN8 was enriched in AC. GSEA score showed that immune activity of CN4 was more intense in IA when compared to LP. Notably, TM0 mainly present in CN8, and TM3 mainly present in CN4. Therefore, the LP was speculated to reach an inert and statical status. TME of AC was featured as colocalization of myeloid cells and tumor cells with high stemness. TME of IA was featured as colocalization of lymphoid cells and tumor cells with high EMT activity.
 Conclusions:
 This is the first study to delineate the homogeneity of tumor cells and heterogeneity of immune cells among different pathological types of NSCLC.

        <tr id="Background Cervical cancer (CC) remains a significant global health challenge despite advancements in screening, HPV vaccination, and therapeutic strategies. Tumor heterogeneity, driven by epigenetic modifications, affects immune evasion, metastasis, and treatment response. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in CC progression and therapy resistance. Single-cell sequencing offers new insights but remains underutilized in CC research. This study integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and deconvolution analysis to identify key genes and immunotherapy targets. By constructing a prognostic model and exploring the immune microenvironment, we aim to provide novel insights into CC pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies. Methods We utilized scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, deconvolution analysis, and pseudotime trajectory mapping to delineate fibroblast subtypes within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of CC. Functional annotations, differential gene expression profiling, cell–cell communication pathways, and transcription factor networks were systematically analyzed. A prognostic model based on bulk RNA-seq data was constructed and validated through survival analysis, with correlations to immune microenvironment characteristics. Functional experiments investigated the role of SDC1, a critical mediator of fibroblast-tumor crosstalk. Additionally, Fibroblast–tumor cell co-culture systems and functional assays were employed to investigate the paracrine role of SDC1. The CAF MYH11⁺ subpopulation was isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Multiplex immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on both cultured cells and human cervical cancer tissue samples to characterize the spatial distribution and dynamic remodeling of MYH11 during stromal reorganization. Results Six distinct fibroblast subtypes were identified, including the C0 MYH11 + fibroblasts, which exhibited unique roles in stemness maintenance, metabolic activity, and immune regulation. Spatial and functional analyses revealed that the C0 subtype is central to tumor-fibroblast interactions, particularly through the MDK-SDC1 signaling axis. The prognostic model incorporating fibroblast-specific markers demonstrated robust predictive power for patient survival outcomes. Additionally, in vitro SDC1 knockdown significantly inhibited CC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Fibroblasts show spatially regulated heterogeneity, with activation markers enriched in the tumor zone and MYH11 highest in normal zones, indicating dynamic stromal remodeling. C0 MYH11 + CAF Promotes Tumor Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Inhibits Apoptosis via Soluble SDC1. Conclusion Our results illustrate, in some ways, the possible immunomodulatory and tumor supporting roles of CAFs in CC TIME and highlight the possibility that the MDK-SDC1 pathway is a promising therapeutic target. This study not only promotes a partially new understanding of temporal heterogeneity in CC, but also provides a possible reference base for the development of new biomarkers and immunotherapy approaches to improve clinical outcomes.

        <tr id="Abstract Background The dynamics of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) play a critical role in understanding tumor development, yet their influence on shaping tumor microenvironments remains largely unexplored. Spatial transcriptomics offers an opportunity to map SNVs within the tumor context, potentially uncovering new insights into tumor microenvironment dynamics. Results This study developed SpatialSNV for identifying effective SNVs across tumor sections using multiple spatial transcriptomics platforms. The analysis revealed that SNVs reflect regional tumor evolutionary traces and extend beyond RNA expression changes. The tumor margins exhibited a distinct mutational profile, with novel SNVs diminishing in a distance-dependent manner from the tumor boundary. These mutations were significantly linked to inflammatory and hypoxic microenvironments. Furthermore, spatially correlated SNV groups were identified, exhibiting distinct spatial patterns and implicating specific roles in tumor–immune system crosstalk. Among these, critical SNVs such as S100A11L40P in colorectal cancer were identified as tumor region–specific mutations. This mutation, located within exonic nonsynonymous regions, may produce neoantigens presented by HLAs, marking it as a potential therapeutic target. Conclusions SpatialSNV represents a promising framework for unraveling the mechanisms underlying tumor–immune crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment by leveraging spatial transcriptomics and SNV-based tissue domain characterization. This approach is designed to be scalable, integrative, and adaptable, making it accessible to researchers aiming to explore tumor heterogeneity and identify therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While there is increasing recognition of diverse tumor phenotypes across patients, less is known about the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity present within an individual. In this study, we aimed to define the patterns, extent, and consequences of inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity in lethal prostate cancer. By combining and integrating in situ tissue-based and sequencing approaches, we analyzed over 630 tumor samples from 52 mPC patients. Our efforts revealed phenotypic heterogeneity at the patient, metastasis, and cellular levels. We observed that intra-patient, inter-tumoral molecular subtype heterogeneity was common in mPC and showed associations with genomic and clinical features. Additionally, cellular proliferation rates varied within a given patient across molecular subtypes and anatomic sites. Single-cell sequencing studies revealed features of morphologically and molecularly divergent tumor cell populations within a single metastatic site. These data provide a deeper insight into the complex patterns of tumoral heterogeneity in mPC with implications for clinical management and the future development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Globally, gastric cancer (GC) stands as the fifth most prevalent form of malignant neoplasm and represents a significant contributor to mortality associated with oncological conditions. Despite advancements in therapeutic strategies for GC, the outcomes for patients with advanced stages of the disease continue to be unfavorable, largely due to tumor heterogeneity and the challenges posed by resistance to therapeutic agents. Metabolic reprogramming is pivotal in driving the advancement of GC, contributing to the development of resistance to pharmacological treatments and facilitating the cancer’s ability to evade immune surveillance. Developing multi-target comprehensive treatment strategies by integrating tumor microenvironment (TME) modulation holds promise for significantly improving therapeutic efficacy.The study analyzed GC and identified key cell subtypes by integrating data derived from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) alongside spatial transcriptomics information. Cell type identification was accomplished using the tool of Seurat, and the spatial distribution of cell types was revealed through the Robust Cell Type Decomposition technique. CellChat was used to analyze the interactions between key cell subtypes and other cells, and the “StLearn” package was employed to investigate spatial cell communication in depth. Additionally, the functional role of the key molecule ELK4 was validated through in vitro experiments.This research utilized scRNA-seq combined with spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively analyze GC, identifying the C1 NDUFAB1+ subtype, which exhibited high proliferative activity, metabolic reprogramming capabilities, and immune evasion properties. It was found that the C1 NDUFAB1+ subtype closely interacted with fibroblasts and pericytes via the PARs signaling pathway. Additionally, in vitro experiments confirmed that knockdown of ELK4 substantially curbed tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.This study revealed the main significance of the C1 NDUFAB1+ subtype in GC, elucidating its core mechanisms in tumor progression, metabolic reprogramming, and immune evasion. ELK4 was identified as a key regulatory factor that markedly enhanced the proliferation, migratory capacity, and invasive potential of tumor cells, while changes in the TME were a driving force behind immune suppression and drug resistance. The findings underscored the importance of developing specific therapeutic targets, targeting metabolic reprogramming, and overcoming immune evasion, providing new theoretical foundations.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, emphasizing the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Decorin (DCN), a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), has been proposed as a tumor suppressor, yet its precise role in HCC and the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains underexplored. Through integrated analyses of bulk RNA and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we identified a distinct tumor stromal subset highly expressing DCN and associated chondroitin sulfate (CS) synthases. Our findings revealed that DCN expression is significantly downregulated in HCC tissue, but upregulated in peri-tumor stroma, where it correlates with better prognosis and reduced capsular invasion. Western blot analysis demonstrated that CS-DCN, the glycosylated form of DCN, plays a dominant role in this context. Single-cell clustering analysis identified a unique stromal subset in HCC characterized by elevated expression of DCN, CSPGs, and CS synthases, associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and protective barrier functions. A six-gene DCN-associated signature derived from this subset, including DCN, BGN, SRPX, CHSY3, CHST3, and CHPF, was validated as a prognostic marker for HCC. Furthermore, functional assays demonstrated that CS-DCN significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Our study highlights the critical role of DCN in HCC TME and provides insights into its therapeutic potential. Modulating CSPG pathways, particularly on CS-DCN-expressing stromal cells, may offer a promising approach for improving HCC treatment and patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Pancreatic angiosarcoma is a rare and highly aggressive tumor originating from lymphatic or vascular endothelial cells, with poor prognosis and few effective treatments. In this study, we aimed to characterize the tumor ecosystem of metastatic pancreatic angiosarcoma, along with its potential treatment strategies. Methods Single-cell RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were performed on samples obtained from one patient, including at total of 16,841 cells from pancreatic angiosarcoma liver metastasis and adjacent normal liver tissue. Results Pancreatic angiosarcoma cells exhibited marked upregulation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), and myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC) proto-oncogene signaling pathways, while presenting limited upregulation of actionable therapeutic targets except for cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and epidermal growth factor receptor. Several immune checkpoint genes, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1), and cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86), were upregulated in tumor-infiltrating T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and myeloid cells. Furthermore, intercellular interaction profiling demonstrated enhanced activity of the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and CD86 signaling pathways within the tumor microenvironment. The gene-set scores of T/NK-cell exhaustion, regulatory T cell, and macrophage angiogenesis were significantly higher in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. However, the phagocytosis scores of macrophages within the tumor-infiltrating region were significantly lower than those in the adjacent normal tissues. Conclusions Our findings outlined an immunosuppressive and angiogenic tumor ecosystem in pancreatic angiosarcoma liver metastasis, suggesting that pancreatic angiosarcoma may be insensitive to most targeted therapies. Conversely, immunotherapies targeting LAG3, PD-L1, and CD86 (e.g. isatuximab, Opdualag, and abatacept) and anti-angiogenic agents may be therapeutically effective and worthy of subsequent exploration.">

        <tr id="Cancer cell spheroids autonomously form in the ascites fluid and are considered a conduit for epithelial ovarian cancer metastasis within the peritoneal cavity. Spheroids are homotypic, avascular 3D structures that acquire resistance to anoikis to remain viable after cellular detachment. We used in vitro spheroid model systems to interrogate pathways critical for spheroid cell proliferation, distinct from those driving monolayer cancer cell proliferation. Using the 105C and KOC-7c human ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) cell lines, which have distinct proliferative phenotypes as spheroids but the same prototypical OCCC gene mutation profile of constitutively activated AKT signaling with the loss of ARID1A, we revealed therapeutic targets that efficiently kill cells in spheroids. RNA-seq analyses compared the transcriptome of 3-day monolayer and spheroid cells from these lines and identified the characteristics of dormant spheroid cell survival, which included the G2/M checkpoint, autophagy, and other stress pathways induced in 105C spheroids, in sharp contrast to the proliferating spheroid cells of the KOC-7c cell line. Next, we assessed levels of various G2/M checkpoint regulators and found a consistent reduction in steady-state levels of checkpoint regulators in dormant spheroid cells, but not proliferative spheroids. Our studies showed that proliferative spheroid cells were sensitive to Wee1 inhibition by AZD1775, but the dormant spheroid cells showed a degree of resistance to AZD1775, both in terms of EC50 values and spheroid reattachment abilities. Thus, we identified biomarkers of dormant spheroids, including the G2/M checkpoint regulators Wee1, Cdc25c, and PLK1, and showed that, when compared to proliferating spheroid cells, the transcriptome of dormant OCCC spheroids is a source of therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play dual roles in cancer, either promoting or suppressing tumor progression, complicating therapeutic approaches. TAMs include recruited macrophages (recMacs), derived from circulating monocytes, and tissue-resident interstitial macrophages (IMs). We recently identified a heterogeneous population of chemokine-expressing IMs, including subsets that support tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation during lung inflammation. Here, we show that IMs can be either pro- or anti-tumorigenic, depending on the subset. Using Pf4ᶜʳᵉCx3cr1ᴰᵀᴿ mice to deplete CD206hi IMs expressing Cxcl13, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10, we demonstrate their essential role in TLS formation, lymphocyte recruitment, and tumor suppression in melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma. In contrast, Ccl2-expressing IMs promote tumor growth by recruiting pro-tumorigenic recMacs. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the distinct localization and chemokine profiles of these subsets. Finally, CCR5 blockade with the FDA-approved inhibitor Maraviroc during neoantigen vaccination improved tumor control by preventing the migration of immunosuppressive, antigen-presenting recMacs (moDCs). These findings support the development of macrophage-targeted therapies by identifying pro-tumorigenic subsets and recMac trafficking as actionable targets, while preserving macrophage populations that sustain anti-tumor immunity.">

 Background:
 Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a smooth muscle-derived tumor with significant heterogeneity and limited treatment options for recurrent/metastatic disease. A lack of targetable driver mutations and prognostic and predictive biomarkers have hampered the care of patients with LMS. There is a great need to better understand the biology of LMS and develop novel therapeutics. Advances in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have allowed for better understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity in diverse cancer subtypes. However, tissue dissociation during this process leads to loss of spatial context. Spatial gene expression analysis builds upon scRNA-seq and has the potential to yield information about tissue organization, cell-cell interactions, niches, and cell states. To date there have been limited application of spatial transcriptomics to sarcoma.
 Methods:
 We performed single nucleus multiome (snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq) on a cohort of 16 primary, untreated LMS samples including 12 soft tissue (STLMS) and 4 uterine (ULMS) tumors. We then designed a custom 480-gene panel using the differentially expressed genes from clusters identified in snRNA-seq data to be able to identify spatial relationships between these clusters and to assess these clusters on a larger scale. We utilized the 10x Genomics Xenium platform. This was applied to LMS tissue microarrays (TMAs) comprising a total of 326 tissue cores from 127 unique patients. Matched primary and metastatic samples from the same patient were available for 33 patients.
 Results:
 Analysis of scRNAseq data identified 2 distinct subtypes: a dedifferentiated subtype with mesenchymal features (MES) and a differentiated subtype with enrichment of smooth muscle cell markers (SMC). Integration of chromatin accessibility data from snATACseq showed enrichment of nuclear factor I (NFI) transcription factor (TF) motifs in the MES and AP-1 motifs in the SMC group. Whole genome sequencing did not reveal an obvious genomic etiology for these subtypes. Spatial transcriptomics was able to identify these 2 subtypes in a larger cohort of tumors. Consistent with snRNAseq data, we find that most tumors had almost exclusively either MES or SMC cells. We assessed spatial relationships between these subtypes and infiltrating immune cells. This revealed an enrichment in immunosuppressive macrophages and exhausted T cells in MES tumors compared to SMC tumors. Analysis of matched primary and metastatic tumors demonstrated that the subtype (MES or SMC) generally remains consistent between different sites of disease.
 Conclusions:
 We identify 2 novel LMS subtypes (MES and SMC) driven by distinct TFs. Spatial transcriptomic analysis confirmed the presence of these 2 subtypes in a larger cohort and demonstrated that MES tumors are associated with a more immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

Integration of ST with public single-cell RNA sequencing data enabled interrogation of transcriptional alterations in T1D pathogenesis across both tissues and cellular scales. In the T1D pancreas, we observed global upregulation of multiple inflammation-associated transcripts, including regenerating islet-derived (REG) family genes, complement factor 3 (C3), SOD2, and OLFM4, and highlighted cellular candidates potentially contributing to these signatures. Within the T1D pLN, we observed spatially restricted upregulation of lymphotoxin-β (LTB) alongside follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-associated transcripts including FDCSP, CLU, and FCER2. Collectively, these findings highlight distinct inflammation signatures in the pancreas and regional pLN which can help inform the development of future therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Background Angiosarcoma, a rare and highly aggressive malignancy originating from vascular endothelial cells, is characterized by its rapid progression, high invasiveness, and poor prognosis. Due to the limited understanding of its tumor microenvironment (TME) and the absence of effective treatments, further research is essential to elucidate its pathogenic mechanisms and improve therapeutic strategies. Objective This study aims to characterize the cellular heterogeneity and unique TME of primary breast angiosarcoma using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), to identify potential therapeutic targets and improve clinical outcomes. Methods Tumor samples were obtained from a patient with bilateral primary breast angiosarcoma and two patients with invasive breast cancer. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was conducted to capture the transcriptomic profiles of individual cells within the tumor samples. Following stringent quality control, a total of 31,771 cells were analyzed using comprehensive bioinformatics approaches. Cell populations were identified and classified into distinct cell types, and differential gene expression analysis was performed to explore key signaling pathways. Functional enrichment analysis was used to identify pathways related to tumor progression and immune evasion. Additionally, cell-cell communication networks were mapped to understand interactions within the TME, with a focus on pathways that may serve as therapeutic targets. Results The scRNA-seq analysis revealed significant differences in the distribution of perivascular cells, fibroblasts, T cells, endothelial cells, and myeloid cells in breast angiosarcoma compared to invasive breast cancer. Key pathways enriched in angiosarcoma samples included growth factor binding, platelet-derived growth factor binding, and ribosome biogenesis, with abnormal expression of several ribosomal proteins. Notably, genes such as FAT4, KDR, FN1, and KIT were highly expressed in angiosarcoma endothelial cells, correlating with poor prognosis. Cell communication analysis highlighted the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis as a crucial mediator of the TME in angiosarcoma. Conclusion This study provides critical insights into the TME of primary breast angiosarcoma, highlighting potential molecular targets and pathways for therapeutic intervention. These findings may inform the development of more effective treatment strategies for this rare and challenging tumor type.

        <tr id="Background Breast cancer progression and metastasis involve the action of multiple transcription factors in tumors and in the cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and understanding how these transcription factors are coordinated can guide novel therapeutic strategies. Myocardin-related transcription factors A and B (MRTFA/B also known as MKL1/2) are two related transcription factors that redundantly control cancer cell invasion and metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer, but their roles in human cancer are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the expression and activation of these transcription factors to better assess their tumorigenic and metastatic impact on breast cancer and cells of the tumor microenvironment. Methods We used a multiplexed immunofluorescence approach to label MRTFA, MRTFB, tumor cells by using pan Cytokeratin, endothelial cells by using CD31, and antigen presenting cells (APCs) by using HLA-DRA on two different breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMA): The breast cancer progression TMA provided by the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN_BrCaProg3) and the University of Illinois Breast Cancer Working Group (TMA BCWG UIC-001-TMA) that included primary tumor and lymph node metastases from patients residing in the West Side and South Side of Chicago. We also used bioinformatics analyses of the TCGA and METABRIC databases and the Broad Institute’s single-cell RNA sequencing portal to investigate MRTFA/B expression patterns in the cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Results We found that in human tumors, MRTFA/B are concurrently activated in cancer cells, but they show distinct patterns of expression across different histological subtypes and in the cells of the TME. Importantly, MRTFA expression was elevated in metastatic tumors of African American patients, who disproportionately die from breast cancer. Interestingly, in contrast to publicly available mRNA expression data, MRTFA was similarly expressed across estrogen receptor (ER) positive and negative breast tumors, while MRTFB expression was highest in ER+ breast tumors. Furthermore, MRTFA was specifically expressed in the perivascular antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which has been previously associated with immune suppression and breast cancer progression. We also found that MRTFA expression correlated with the expression of the immune checkpoint protein V-set immunoregulatory receptor (VSIR) in the TCGA data and found that MRTFA activity promotes VSIR expression in THP-1 monocytes and cultured HEK293 cells. Conclusions Our results provide unique insights into how MRTFA and MRTFB promote metastasis in human cancer, the differences of their expression patterns, and their immune suppressive function within the breast cancer TME. Our results will guide future studies on targeting MRTFA/B transcriptional activity and the resulting immune suppression in breast cancer.

        <tr id="Cervical cancer represents a significant global health challenge, with complex cellular and molecular mechanisms driving its progression from HPV infection to invasive malignancy. This study employed an integrated approach combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (stRNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize the tumor microenvironment (TME) across different stages of cervical cancer development. Through analysis of samples from normal cervix, HPV-infected normal cervix, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and invasive cervical cancer, we identified distinct cellular populations and their dynamic changes during disease progression. Our findings revealed significant heterogeneity in immune cell populations, particularly highlighting the role of SPP1+ macrophages that were substantially enriched in cervical cancer compared to precancerous and normal tissues. Cell-cell communication networks and spatial mapping demonstrated that SPP1+ macrophages interact extensively with immune cells through the SPP1-CD44 signaling axis. This interaction contributes to an immunosuppressive microenvironment through modulation of T cell function and promotion of tumor cell survival. Furthermore, high expression of SPP1 correlated with advanced tumor stages and poor overall survival in cervical cancer patients, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Our comprehensive characterization of the cellular landscape and intercellular communication networks in cervical cancer progression provides valuable insights for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the TME, particularly through disruption of the SPP1-CD44 axis. These findings establish a foundation for more effective personalized approaches to improve clinical outcomes in cervical cancer patients.">

We describe an integrated framework of spatial transcriptomics, tumor/normal DNA sequencing, and bulk RNA sequencing to identify shared and distinct characteristics of an initial cohort of eleven gliomas of varied pathology and a replication cohort of six high-grade glioblastomas. We identify focally amplified extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in four of the eleven initial gliomas, with subclonal tumor heterogeneity in two EGFR-amplified grade IV glioblastomas. In a TP53-mutated glioblastoma, we detect a subclone with EGFR amplification on ecDNA coupled to chromosome 17 loss of heterozygosity. To validate subclonal somatic aneuploidy and copy number alterations associated with ecDNA double minutes, we examine the replication cohort, identifying MDM2/MDM4 ecDNA subclones in two glioblastomas. The spatial heterogeneity of EGFR and p53 inactivation underscores the role of ecDNA in enabling rapid oncogene amplification and enhancing tumor adaptability under selective pressure.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are functionally diverse stromal regulators that orchestrate tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance through dynamic crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent advances in single‐cell multiomics and spatial transcriptomics have identified conserved CAF subtypes with distinct molecular signatures, spatial distributions, and context‐dependent roles, highlighting their dual capacity to promote immunosuppression or restrain tumor growth. However, therapeutic strategies struggle to reconcile this functional duality, hindering clinical translation. This review systematically categorizes CAF subtypes by origin, biomarkers, and TME‐specific functions, focusing on their roles in chemoresistance, maintenance of stemness, and formation of immunosuppressive niches. We evaluate emerging targeting approaches, including selective depletion of tumor‐promoting subsets (e.g., fibroblast activation protein+ CAFs), epigenetic reprogramming toward antitumor phenotypes, and inhibition of CXCL12/CXCR4 or transforming growth factor‐beta signaling pathways. Spatial multiomics‐driven combinatorial therapies, such as the synergistic use of CAFs and immune checkpoint inhibitors, are highlighted as strategies to overcome microenvironment‐driven resistance. By integrating CAF biology with translational advances, this work provides a roadmap for developing subtype‐specific biomarkers and precision stromal therapies, directly informing efforts to disrupt tumor‐stroma coevolution. Key concepts include spatial transcriptomics, stromal reprogramming, and tumor‐stroma coevolution, offering actionable insights for both mechanistic research and clinical innovation.">

        <tr id="Pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGG) comprise 35% of all brain tumors. Despite favorable survival, patients experience significant morbidity from disease and treatments. A deeper understanding of pLGG biology is essential to identify novel, more effective, and less toxic therapies. We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and cytokine analyses to characterize and understand tumor and immune cell heterogeneity of pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) and ganglioglioma (GG). scRNA-seq revealed tumor and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor cell subsets include both progenitor and mature cell populations. Immune cells included myeloid and lymphocytic cells. There was a significant difference between the prevalence of two major myeloid subclusters between PA and GG. Bulk and single-cell cytokine analyses evaluated the immune cell signaling cascade with distinct immune phenotypes among tumor samples. KIAA1549-BRAF tumors appeared more immunogenic, secreting higher levels of immune cell activators and chemokines, compared to BRAF V600E tumors. Spatial transcriptomics revealed the differential gene expression of these chemokines and their location within the TME. A multi-pronged analysis demonstrated the complexity of the PA and GG TME and differences between genetic drivers that may influence their response to immunotherapy.

Yet, the cellular heterogeneity and molecular mechanisms involved in CRC development remain inadequately characterized. Methods To understand the molecular mechanisms driving the onset and progression of CRC, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of ten clinical colorectal samples representing sequential pathological stages using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Validation was performed through immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry analyses in a separate human colorectal tissue cohort. Additional verification was carried out using bioinformatics analyses of public TCGA and GEO datasets. Results Our comprehensive analyses not only reveal the cellular diversity and transcriptomic differences throughout disease progression but also highlight the importance of leveraging ligand–receptor gene expression to distinguish various cell subtypes. Subsequent examination and validation with a larger sample cohort uncover the specific involvement of ligand–receptor genes, transcription factors, immunoglobulin genes, and heat shock genes in regulating immune responses and microenvironment changes during colorectal tumorigenesis. Conclusions Our extensive transcriptome dataset provides valuable insights and acts as a fundamental resource to deepen our understanding of the complex molecular landscape in CRC.

In total, we found 41 patterns of immune infiltration and stroma profiles, identifying heterogeneous yet unique TME portraits for each cancer and several new findings. Our findings indicate that leukocytes play a major role in distinguishing various tumor types, and that a shared immune-rich TME cluster predicts better survival in bladder cancer for luminal and basal squamous subtypes, as well as in melanoma for RAS-hotspot subtypes. Our detailed deconvolution and mutational correlation analyses uncover 35 therapeutic target and candidate response biomarkers hypotheses (including CASP8 and RAS pathway genes).">

 Cancer treatment options including small molecules, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), CAR T-cells, and combination therapies are rapidly expanding to improve cancer patient survival. However, efficacy of targeted therapies is limited by interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneity in breast cancer, and may be further exacerbated by dysregulated tumor microenvironments. For example, studies suggested that changes in tumor and breast tissue microenvironment in obesity (e.g. inflammation, increased growth factors) could lead to worsened prognosis that could be related to therapy resistance. Systematic characterization of the cellular effects of emerging drug candidates, particularly across different tumor microenvironments, is challenging, as it needs to be surveyed in diverse cancer contexts beyond just a handful of cancer cell lines. To overcome this challenge, we created PRISM (Profiling Relative Inhibition Simultaneously in Mixtures), an effective drug discovery screening platform with over 900 genetically distinct cancer cell lines of diverse lineages, to rapidly test therapeutics in a high-throughput manner. These cell lines, including 33 different breast cancer cell lines covering diverse cell types and subgroups, carry a specific 24 nucleotide “barcode” tag and have rich baseline genomic and functional characterization. They are first pooled into 20-25 cell pools of different lineages with similar growth rates, then subsequently cultured together with or without drugs. The relative barcode quantity read out by NextGen sequencing determines cell line responses to drugs. This pooled approach significantly reduces the time and the resources required for drug screening. Importantly, utilizing the rich cell line characterization to interpret viability profiles enables the identification of drivers of differential sensitivity and potential biomarkers of compound response. Furthermore, we created a breast cancer cell specific pool to investigate how media conditions mirroring different tumor microenvironments [e.g. media filtration, addition of insulin (0.01 mg/mL) or EGF (0.01 ug/mL)] can impact drug effects on breast cancer cells. In the PRISM 900+ cell panel treated with ADCs conjugated to different payloads that target HER2, there was a clear association between cell line sensitivity and ERBB2 (encoding HER2) gene expression, with the strongest effects on viability observed in a subset of cell lines overexpressing ERBB2. Upon further comparison of biomarker profiles across different ADCs, we established relationships between payload resistance and ABCB1 efflux pumps emerged for a subset of ADC payloads. Using the breast cancer cell specific pool, our data showed that estrogen receptor (ER) degraders fulvestrant and vepdegestrant (ARV-471) had significantly greater effects in reducing viability of ER+ versus ER- breast cancer cell lines. Media filtering reduced the drug effects of fulvestrant but not ARV-471, suggesting that ARV-471 efficacy may be less sensitive to the tumor microenvironment than fulvestrant. Lapatinib (HER2/neu and EGF receptor inhibitor) was more effective in killing HER2+ than HER2- negative breast cancer cells, with cells cultured in EGF-spiked media being more sensitive to lapatinib, whereas media filtration diminished its effects. We did not observe breast cancer subgroup specific killing by alpelisib (PI3K inhibitor) or olaparib (PARP inhibitor), but breast cancer cells became less sensitive to alpelisib when cultured in either insulin- or EGF-spiked media, and less sensitive to olaparib in EGF-spiked media. Overall, our study highlights how the PRISM 900+ cell panel can provide insights into drug specificity, cancer subtype selectivity, and to uncover clinically relevant targets. The breast cancer specific pool can further increase the throughput of understanding how drug responses may be altered in different tumor microenvironments in breast cancer.

 Background:
 Despite the transformational impact of immune checkpoint blockade, many cancer patients do not experience long-term survival. T cells with innate immune signatures can secrete inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and deliver potent cytotoxic signals potentially ideal for tumor immunity. The novel double-stranded RNA sensor RIG-I agonist SLR14 improved the control of murine melanoma. We tested the hypothesis that SLR14 transforms T cells to a cytotoxic state in immunologically “cold” human tumor specimens.
 Methods:
 We developed an approach, called PERCEPT, to directly test the response of patient tumor and immune samples to novel and established therapies
 ex vivo
 using perturbational single-cell RNA sequencing (Table). We obtained 9 surgical resections from primary or metastatic melanoma and Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) tumors and lymph node metastases and made suspension replicates of tumor and infiltrating immune cell co-cultures. We stimulated for 42-48 hours (Table). We Flourescently Activated Cell Sorted live cells and then barcoded for multiplexed single-cell sequencing using 10x scRNAseq. We used CINEMA-OT to identify factors associated with response and resistance to the perturbations tested. We developed and validated CRISPR-KO MCC and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines, and co-cultured with CD14+ monocytes or monocyte-derived DCs.
 Results:
 Stimulation with RIG-I agonist SLR14 induced expression beyond canonical IFN-stimulated genes in tumor cells, NK cells, and T cells. SLR14 stimulates tumor-infiltrating T cells into antiviral states in tumor-immune co-cultures and primes
 in vitro
 T-cell production of IFNγ. However, MCC immune infiltrate responsiveness to IFN or SLR14 was notably decreased compared to the melanoma samples, and perturbational computational analyses with CINEMA-OT identified the cytokine midkine (MDK) associated with nonresponse in MCC. Knockout of MDK restored response to IFN and SLR14 by MCC and SCLC tumor cell lines, as well as co-cultured CD14+ monocytes or monocyte-derived DCs.
 Conclusions:
 Our approach revealed that midkine, a multifunctional cytokine, suppresses innate immune sensing of IFN and SLR14 in both tumor and immune cells, disrupting the tumor immunity cycle at multiple points. We show that this effect, while comparatively infrequent in melanoma, is pronounced in MCC and SCLC. Our study thus uses a direct assessment of patient tumor and immune samples to identify a novel resistance mechanism enriched in neuroendocrine tumors MCC and SCLC.

        <tr id="Preclinical modeling of epithelial ovarian cancer in immune competent mice progressing to orthotopic, spontaneous tumors is challenging, requiring multiple genetic modifications in the host. Transplantable models using cell lines are easier to implement, given that they reproduce the key disease characteristics. To create new in vivo ovarian tumor models, we have generated a total of 28 murine ovarian cancer cell lines with distinct genetic traits such as deletion of Trp53, activation of KrasG12D, deletion of Pten or KrasG12D/Pten-/- combination. Two distinct Trp53 null cell lines recapitulate high grade serous histology when orthotopically injected in immune competent, syngeneic hosts. Cells with Pten deletion trigger high grade endometrioid tumors, and cells with dual KrasG12D activation and Pten deletion model carcinosarcoma. The cells express different tumor antigens, secrete varying levels of cytokines and chemokines, and trigger tumors with diverse inflammation profiles and various intratumoral T and B lymphocyte infiltration patterns. RNAseq data from 16 cell lines reveal the gene expression profile across distinct models with different histotypes. This versatile collection of murine cell lines supports translationally relevant studies in ovarian cancer.">

        <tr id="Cancer drug resistance is multi-factorial, driven by heritable (epi)genetic changes but also phenotypic plasticity. Here, we dissected drivers of resistance by perturbing colorectal cancer patient-derived organoids longitudinally with drugs in sequence. Combined longitudinal lineage tracking, single cell multi-omics analysis, evolutionary modelling, and machine learning revealed that different targeted drugs select for distinct subclones, supporting rationally designed drug sequences. The cellular memory of drug resistance was encoded as a heritable epigenetic configuration from which multiple transcriptional programs could run, supporting a one-to-many (epi)genotype-to-phenotype map that explains how clonal expansions and plasticity manifest together. This epigenetic landscape may ensure drug resistant subclones can exhibit distinct phenotypes in changing environments while still preserving the cellular memory encoding for their selective advantage. Chemotherapy resistance was instead entirely driven by transient phenotypic plasticity rather than stable clonal selection. Inducing further chromosomal instability before drug application changed clonal evolution but not convergent transcriptional programs. Collectively, these data show how genetic and epigenetic alterations are selected to engender a "permissive epigenome" that enables phenotypic plasticity.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant non-cancerous cell type in glioblastoma (GBM) and heavily influence GBM biology, contributing to tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, immune evasion, and neovascularization. Current in vitro models that utilize IL-4/IL-13 stimulation fail to capture the transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of TAMs observed in vivo. In this study, we utilize a serum-free indirect co-culture model with patient-derived xenolines to polarize primary human macrophages and characterize their molecular and functional phenotypes. We demonstrate that xenoline-polarized macrophages diverge from classical M1/M2 states and instead adopt transcriptional signatures reflective of TAM subsets identified from patients. Notably, macrophages polarized with the radiation-therapy selected xenoline, JX14P-RT, exhibited gene expression patterns enriched for interferon response and hypoxia, mirroring recurrent GBM samples. In contrast, JX14P TAMs showed enrichment in phagocytic gene sets. Functional validation of these phenotypes revealed discrepancies between the transcriptionally predicted and observed phenotypes, emphasizing the importance of integrating phenotypic validation in sequencing studies. Altogether, our findings establish xenoline-polarized macrophages as a useful alternative to traditional models that can be used to study immune-interactions in vitro.

 Background:
 High-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-CIN) affects 200,000 U.S. women annually, with rising prevalence among those aged 30 & older, many of whom missed the opportunity for HPV vaccination. Treatment remains predominantly surgical, with a notable absence of pharmacologic interventions. Clinical trial endpoints rely on histological regression, but standard microscopy cannot accurately distinguish between regressing and progressing lesions. Compelling evidence underscores the tumor microenvironment’s (TME) critical role in driving immune suppression and malignant transformation. Leveraging a novel spatial imaging platform, this study provides high-resolution molecular insights into HG-CIN directly from routine H&E-stained slides, enabling precise characterization of immune marker distributions and their implications for disease progression. This technology has the potential to transform tissue analysis and significantly impact drug development.
 Methods:
 Sixteen formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were obtained from the health system’s Biospecimen Repository, with twelve used to optimize the sequencing protocol directly from H&E slides. Sample was categorized as CIN3, benign, or micro-invasive cervical mucosa based on the history, Pap smear/HPV test results, and an expert review by a Gynecologic Pathologist. Library generation and sequencing were conducted using Visium Gene Expression (both SD & HD platforms) kits for FFPE (10x Genomics). Specific genetic markers for immunosuppressive cell activities were highlighted to demonstrate its differential presence in CIN3 vs normal cervical tissue.
 Results:
 Sixteen FFPE samples were analyzed, with 11 used to optimize sequencing protocols. Three CIN3, three normal, and one micro-invasive cervical cancer sample revealed distinct tumor, stromal, and immune microenvironments. CIN3 tissues had elevated Tregs markers (FOXP3, CD4), MDSCs (CD11b, CD33, HLA-DR), and the Treg trafficking molecules CCR7 and TGF-β within stromal regions. Additionally, CIN3 had high gene expression for CDKN2A, which encodes the immunosuppressive ligand PDL1.
 Conclusions:
 The CIN and cancer microenvironment demonstrated strong immunosuppressive markers across immune, stromal, and epithelial compartments, aligning with key known features of tumorigenesis and progression. This spatial imaging platform & optimized workflow captures biologically relevant data directly from standard routinely stained H&E slide, achieving near single-cell resolution, enabling histopathologic comparison to gene expression data. Our study revealed unique immune suppression profiles in CIN3 linked to HPV progression, highlighting the platform’s potential to transform tissue analysis and advance drug development applications.

        <tr id="Radiomics is undergoing a paradigm shift from single-omics to multi-omics, from single-temporal to multi-temporal analysis, and from global to subregional analysis. These transformations have shown great potential in addressing key challenges related to imaging changes before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. Furthermore, radiomics has achieved remarkable progress in tasks such as exploring tumor heterogeneity and uncovering underlying biological mechanisms. Integrating imaging data with gene data offers novel perspectives for understanding imaging changes driven by specific genetic alterations. However, current radiomics studies on neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer have not yet achieved a close integration of imaging changes with underlying biological mechanisms. They are largely limited to simple associations between models and genomic data, without in-depth interpretation of the biological significance inherent in imaging features, which is essential to directly link these features with the dynamic progression of the disease. This review seeks to explore the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of imaging alterations observed during NAC for breast cancer, while assessing their biological implications using established analytical approaches. It highlights the distinct advantages of spatial-temporal radiomics in predictive model development and examines potential correlations between imaging dynamics and gene expression profiles before and after NAC. Additionally, we critically examines previous radiogenomics studies, providing theoretical insights into their limitations. Finally, the review proposes future directions and innovative approaches for applying spatial-temporal radiogenomics in NAC for breast cancer, serving as a valuable reference and roadmap for researchers and clinical practitioners in this field.">

Despite the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors, their efficacy is limited to 27 to 45% of patients. Identifying likely treatment responders is essential for optimizing healthcare and improving quality of life. We generated multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) images, histopathology, and RNA sequencing data from human NSCLC tissues. Through the analysis of mIF images, we characterized the spatial organization of 1.5 million cells based on the expression levels for 33 biomarkers. To enable large-scale characterization of tumor microenvironments, we developed NucSegAI, a deep learning model for automated nuclear segmentation and cellular classification in histology images. With this model, we analyzed the morphological, textural, and topological phenotypes of 45.6 million cells across 119 whole-slide images. Through unsupervised phenotype discovery, we identified specific lymphocyte phenotypes predictive of immunotherapy response. Our findings can improve patient stratification and guide selection of effective therapeutic regimens.">

        <tr id="Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, accounting for ≈10 million deaths annually. Critically, it is metastasis and not the primary tumour that causes most of these deaths. Understanding the mechanisms behind cancer dissemination and therapy resistance is thus a pressing challenge. Traditional bulk tissue analyses have failed to capture the full spectrum of intra-tumour heterogeneity and the dynamic interactions within the tumour microenvironment. Studying cancer at the single-cell level allows unravelling the roles of rare subpopulations, cell-cell interactions, and spatial dynamics that govern tumour evolution, metastasis, and immune evasion. This review explores how recent advances in microfluidic technologies are transforming ability to model and study cancer at the single-cell level. Cutting-edge platforms are highlighted, including droplet microfluidics, single cell-derived spheroids, and tumour-chips, that enable physiologically relevant 3D cancer models. By integrating immune components, biosensing, and patient-derived materials, these platforms hold promise for advancing drug screening, immunotherapy assessment, and personalised medicine. It is concluded by identifying key challenges and priorities for future work, which should focus on increasing model complexity, reproducibility, and integration of spatiotemporal multiomics to better dissect tumour heterogeneity and accelerate clinical translation.">

These include cases that retain expression of luminal markers and those that lose hormone dependence and acquire neuroendocrine features. While there are distinct transcriptomic and epigenomic differences between castration-resistant adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine prostate cancer, the extent of overlap and degree of diversity across tumor metastases in individual patients has not been fully characterized. Here we perform combined DNA methylation, RNA-sequencing, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 profiling across metastatic lesions from patients with CRPC/NEPC. Integrative analyses identify DNA methylation-driven gene links based on location (H3K27ac, H3K27me3, promoters, gene bodies) pointing to mechanisms underlying dysregulation of genes involved in tumor lineage (ASCL1, AR) and therapeutic targets (PSMA, DLL3, STEAP1, B7-H3). Overall, these data highlight how integration of DNA methylation with RNA-sequencing and histone marks can inform intraindividual epigenetic heterogeneity and identify putative mechanisms driving transcriptional reprogramming in castration-resistant prostate cancer.">

 Background:
 Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that engage in direct cytotoxic responses against malignant cells and promote pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironments. While studies have predominantly focused on conventional NK cell subsets, recent findings uncovered adaptive and tissue-resident (TR) subsets with unique functional properties. The influence of distinct NK cell subsets on tumor immunobiology and clinical outcomes remains unknown.
 Methods:
 Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of primary, therapy-naïve tumors from 276 patients across 14 cancer types, as well as 39 patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), was accessed through publicly available datasets. We employed systematic computational analyses to phenotype and examine intra-tumoral NK cells. Gene signatures for NK cell subsets were applied to bulk RNA-sequencing from 212,105 tumor samples to delineate their associations with clinical outcomes using the Caris CODEai database.
 Results:
 Six main subsets of NK cells were identified in solid tumors, including conventional CD56
 dim
 and CD56
 bright
 NK cells, alongside adaptive, TR adaptive, TR CD56
 bright
 , and TR CD56
 bright
 /adaptive subsets. Across cancer, TR adaptive NK cells emerged as the most prognostic subset, with high infiltration conferring significantly longer overall survival (HR[95% CI] = 0.68[0.66-0.69], p < 0.001) than conventional CD56
 dim
 and CD56
 bright
 subsets. This was also observed in cohorts of head and neck, non-small cell lung, and esophageal cancers, particularly those treated with ICB. Notably, elevated TR adaptive NK cell infiltration was more prognostic than high tumor mutational burden in these settings. This was most apparent in ICB-treated head and neck cancers (HR = 0.48[0.41-0.57], p < 0.001 vs HR = 0.90[0.76-1.04], p = 0.16). Additionally, TR adaptive NK cells were strongly correlated to the infiltration of CD8
 +
 T cells and B cells in tumors. Underlying these observations, our scRNA-seq analyses demonstrated that TR adaptive NK cells exhibit the highest immunomodulatory activity of all subsets, expressing high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (
 CCL3
 ,
 CXCL13
 , and
 IFNG
 ) and low levels of immunosuppressive cytokines (
 TGFB1
 ). Mechanistically, this activity was linked to the upregulation of transcription factors associated with NK cell activation, function, and persistence and downregulation of genes related to stress response and exhaustion. Interestingly, scRNA-seq from paired pre- and post-ICB-treated tumors revealed a unique expansion of cytotoxic
 GZMB
 + TR adaptive NK cells after treatment.
 Conclusions:
 TR adaptive NK cells represent a novel subset of NK cells that may drive anti-tumor immune responses, particularly in the context of ICB treatment. Features of this unique population may be harnessed to design more effective NK cell-based therapies against solid tumors.

        <tr id="Background The heterogeneity of colorectal cancer (CRC) and its complex immune microenvironment pose significant challenges for treatment. Understanding the cellular composition and dynamic changes is essential for uncovering mechanisms of tumour progression. Methods To investigate the cellular heterogeneity and immune microenvironment of CRC, identifying critical subpopulations, functional pathways, and prognostic biomarkers, single-cell transcriptomic data from 41 CRC samples across four datasets were integrated. Bioinformatic analyses identified cellular subpopulations, cell communication networks, and prognostic biomarkers. The expression patterns, clinical significance and biological function of TUBB were validated in vitro. Results A distinct epithelial subpopulation with proliferative and invasive features was identified, promoting tumour progression by resisting apoptosis and remodelling the extracellular matrix. ActMono, a terminal state of myeloid cells, was enriched in tumours and linked to disease progression. Cell communication analysis highlighted galectin signalling in immune regulation. A prognostic model (CRS) based on secretory immune cell-related genes identified TUBB as a key molecule influencing the cell cycle and extracellular matrix remodelling, with its expression patterns, clinical significance and biological effects validated in vitro.

        <tr id="Extracellular vesicles (EVs) is promising in predicting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies. But it is challenging to determine the level of circulating EVs due to their variations in spatial and temporal distribution. To address this, we developed an in situ EV detection platform integrating multiplex EV capture with microfluidic-generated immune-tumor spheroids. This platform enables in situ monitoring of EV secretion dynamics under ICI and chemotherapeutic treatments, capturing localized and temporal changes in EV release. Using predictive models, we identified EVs carrying programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) as the most robust predictors of spheroid viability during treatment. RNA sequencing further revealed that dynamic EV expression changes are driven by gene transcription, providing a temporal understanding of EV regulation. Our platform overcomes the limitations of traditional methods by offering a physiologically relevant system to study EV-mediated immune responses. By addressing the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of EVs, this work advances EV-based biomarker discovery and provides a foundation for optimizing personalized immunotherapies.

        <tr id="During cancer development, mutations promote gene expression changes that cause transformation. Leukemia is frequently associated with aberrant HOXA expression driven by translocations in nucleoporin genes or KMT2A, and mutations in NPM1. How disparate mutations converge on this regulatory pathway is not understood. Here we demonstrate that mutant NPM1 (NPM1c) forms nuclear condensates in multiple human cell lines, mouse models, and primary patient samples. We show NPM1c phase separation is necessary and sufficient to coordinate the recruitment of NUP98 and KMT2A to condensates. Through extensive mutagenesis and pharmacological destabilization of phase separation, we find that NPM1c condensates are necessary for regulating gene expression, promoting in vivo expansion, and maintaining the undifferentiated leukemic state. Finally, we show that nucleoporin and KMT2A fusion proteins form condensates that are biophysically indistinguishable from NPM1c condensates. Together, these data define a new condensate underlying leukemias that we term coordinating bodies (C-bodies), and propose C-bodies as a therapeutic vulnerability.">

 Background:
 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy with a median survival of 9–11 months. Despite the addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to frontline chemotherapy, improvements remain limited. SCLC evades anti-tumor immunity by suppressing major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and antigen presentation (AP). The variability of MHC repression across molecular subtypes of SCLC and high-grade neuroendocrine tumors is not fully understood. This study analyzed clinical SCLC and neuroendocrine tumor samples to identify molecular subtypes and regulators of MHC repression, enhancing the understanding of immune evasion.
 Methods:
 Molecular profiling was conducted on 944 SCLC and 5056 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors using next-generation DNA (592-gene panel/whole exome), RNA (whole transcriptome) sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Transcriptomic profiling of 40 SCLC cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) was also performed.
 Results:
 Key regulators and gene networks driving MHC-I suppression in SCLC and other high-grade neuroendocrine tumors were identified. Canonical (MHC-I and II) and non-canonical AP expression scores characterized the spectrum of MHC-I repression across subtypes. Low MHC-I scores correlated with reduced immune signatures (e.g., T cell-inflamed, NK cell, and STING pathway signatures; Spearman = 0.87, 0.58, 0.62, respectively) and predicted poor OS and PFS to immunotherapy. Enhancer network and gene expression analyses identified actionable regulators of MHC-I repression, including interferon signaling. Knockout studies of top MHC-I regulators and single cell analyses revealed non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) genes (like DNAPKCs) inversely correlated with HLA-A/B/C expression. DNAPKCs inhibition upregulated MHC-I, TAP1, and TAP2, enhanced antigen-specific T-cell-mediated cytolysis in SCLC. This inhibition activated the STING pathway, increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and enhanced MHC Class-I. Combining DNAPKCs inhibitor NU1774 with anti-PD-L1 reactivated MHC-I and led to significant tumor regression in aggressive murine SCLC models, supporting new combination therapies.
 Conclusions:
 We identified molecular subtypes and actionable pathways to restore MHC-I expression in SCLC, advancing understanding of immune evasion mechanisms. DNAPKCs is established as a key therapeutic target, enhancing PD-L1 blockade by reactivating antigen presentation. The developed MHC-I expression scores and associated biomarkers offer predictive tools for identifying patients likely to benefit from immunotherapy. These findings support biomarker-driven, personalized approaches to improve treatment for SCLC, addressing a critical unmet need in this devastating cancer.

 Background:
 Biology is three-dimensional, yet we lack the technology to picture the structural and molecular details throughout the tumour tissue volume, undermining our efforts to understand the heterogeneous and complex 3D spatial relationships. Ideally, archived paraffin blocks should also be revivable for comprehensive 3D analysis of multiple molecular markers at single-cell resolution.
 Methods:
 We developed a foundational chemistry (termed INSIHGT) that enables highly multiplexed, deeply penetrating immunostaining in human tissue samples. We then developed a tissue revival protocol enabling INSIHGT to be used in archived samples retrieved from paraffin blocks. We further designed and constructed a light-sheet microscope that achieves can image cleared tissues (1 cm x 1 cm x 5 mm) within 6 hours at 0.5 μm isotropic resolution. We also curated a panel of markers and probes, along with deterministic image processing strategy to achieve consistent universal cell boundary detection and segmentation in normal and tumourous tissues.
 Results:
 The overall technology platform - INSIHGT-revived - allows non-destructive virtualization of any archived tissues retrived from paraffin wax. With one round of staining and imaging, 4 markers - along with nuclear and cell segmentation panel - can be visualized at the subcellular level in centimetre-sized tissues within 6 days. The staining and retrieval chemistry has been proven to be compatible with >300 off-the-shelf antibodies, including those for epigenetics and post-translational modifications. Using our custom designed panel, accurate single-cell segmentation can be achieved for nearly all epithelial, immune and stromal cell types, improving marker expression scoring by 20%, while 3D imaging also improve machine learning-based segmentation accuracy by ~30% compared to 2D images. Up to 28-plex profiling using multi-round staining can be achieved in 1mm-thick samples preserved only with conventional formalin fixation. Samples processed with our pipeline is indistinguishable from non-processed controls by pathology specialist using H&E, immunohistochemistry, bulk transcriptomics by RNA sequencing, whole genome sequencing, and spatial proteomics profiling by mass spectrometry. As a proof-of-concept, we quantified IO-related, ADC-related, prognostically relevant and biologically interesting markers in lung, colon, and breast cancer specimens.
 Conclusions:
 INSIHGT-revived can virtualize a gold mine of data from tissue archives. With extremely large data throughput reflecting ground-truth 3D tumour architectures and spatially resolved single-cell expression profiles, INSIHGT-revived can empower the discovery and clinical translation of biomarkers for patient selection for therapeutics.

        <tr id="Background Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy. Traditional clinical staging systems have limited value in prognostic evaluation and treatment guidance, often failing to capture the profound impact of intratumoral diversity on patient outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides new perspectives on the cellular makeup and conditions in tumor tissues, with promising implications for functional classification and personalized therapeutic strategies in esophageal cancer. Methods In this study, we integrated scRNA-seq data with bulk RNA-seq profiles from esophageal cancer tissues to construct a comprehensive cellular atlas, focusing on the transcriptional characteristics of epithelial cells. Malignant epithelial cells were identified based on copy number variation (CNV) features using inferCNV analysis. Their developmental states and regulatory mechanisms were further characterized via transcription factor activity inference (SCENIC) and pseudotime trajectory analysis (Monocle). Based on marker genes of malignant epithelial subpopulations, we developed a multi-gene risk scoring model using data from the TCGA and GEO (GSE53624) cohorts. The model’s predictive value for immune landscape, mutational features, and drug sensitivity was also evaluated. Additionally, qRT-PCR was conducted to quantify the expression levels of model genes in ESCC tissue samples, further evaluating their biological relevance. Functional roles of the key gene HMGB3 were validated in vitro through CCK-8 proliferation assays, Transwell invasion assays, and colony formation assays following gene knockdown in ESCC cell lines. Results At the single-cell level, we identified ten major cell types and six distinct malignant epithelial subclusters, which exhibited pronounced heterogeneity in cell cycle states, transcriptional regulatory networks, and differentiation trajectories. High CNV scores and the enrichment of specific transcription factors (e.g., FOXC1, E2F1, RUNX1) suggested a proliferative and immune-evasive phenotype. A six-gene prognostic model (HMGB3, CHORDC1, CTSD, BTG2, MT1E, PHYHD1) showed strong predictive accuracy for overall survival in the TCGA and GSE53624 cohorts. Furthermore, the risk score showed a significant correlation with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, increased tumor purity, and the activation of certain immune-related pathways. Analysis of drug sensitivity suggests that patients classified as low-risk could respond better to various targeted therapies and chemotherapeutic agents, underscoring their potential clinical relevance. Functional assays revealed that HMGB3 knockdown markedly suppressed ESCC cell proliferation, invasion, and colony formation, supporting its oncogenic role in esophageal cancer progression. Conclusion This study systematically characterized epithelial cell heterogeneity in esophageal cancer at single-cell resolution and established a risk model based on malignant epithelial markers that effectively predicts prognosis, immune status, and potential drug response.

        <tr id="Drug resistance poses a significant challenge in cancer therapy, contributing to rapid recurrence, disease progression, and high patient mortality. Despite its critical impact, few reliable predictors for cancer drug response or failure have been established for clinical application. Tumor heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment (TME) are pivotal factors influencing cancer drug efficacy and resistance. Tumor heterogeneity leads to variable therapeutic responses among patients, while dynamic interactions between cancer cells and the TME enhance tumor survival and proliferation, underscoring the urgent need to identify cellular hallmarks for predicting drug response and resistance. Single-cell and spatial omics technologies provide high-resolution insights into gene expression at the individual cell level, capturing intercellular heterogeneity and revealing the underlying pathologies, mechanisms, and cellular interactions. This review delves into the principles, methodologies, and workflows of single-cell and spatial omics in cancer drug research, highlighting key hallmarks involving tumor heterogeneity, TME reprogramming, cell–cell interactions, metabolic modulation, and signaling pathway regulation in drug treatment at single-cell and spatial levels.

 The tumor microenvironment and biomarkers play a pivotal role in breast cancer research, yet there remains a pressing need for effective biomarkers. This study focuses on identifying a novel IGKC+ T Cell subpopulation and its related biomarkers to pave the way for innovative targeted therapies and improved clinical outcomes.


Methods
We first performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize immune cell heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment, leading to the identification of series cell subpopulation. Then, by performing univariate analysis to correlate cell proportions with patient prognosis, we identified a novel IGKC+ T cell subpopulation. Next, we applied bulk RNA-seq deconvolution algorithms to estimate the abundance of this subpopulation across breast cancer cohorts. Differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were employed to identify genes associated with the IGKC+ T cell population. To pinpoint key regulatory genes, we applied machine learning algorithms. Based on the hub genes identified, we constructed a prognostic risk model and developed a nomogram to aid clinical decision-making. Immune infiltration patterns were further assessed in high- vs low-risk groups defined by the model. Finally, functional validation was performed through overexpression of BCL2L14 in vitro, and downstream signaling pathways were examined.


Results
We identified the novel IGKC+ T cell subpopulation and core genes. Machine learning pinpointed BCL2L14, IGHD, MAPT-AS1, NT5DC4, and TNIP3 as key regulators of breast cancer progression in this subpopulation. The model stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with high-risk patients showing worse prognosis and weaker immune infiltration. Overexpression of BCL2L14 was experimentally demonstrated to accelerate breast cancer progression, linked to enhanced phosphorylation of the NF-κB pathway.


Conclusion
Our results underscore BCL2L14 as a potential driver within the novel T-cell subpopulation and a critical biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis. These findings provide a basis for developing advanced diagnostic tools and targeted therapies, which may ultimately enhance patient prognosis.">

        <tr id="Renal cell carcinoma is characterized by a poor prognosis. Recently, renal cell carcinoma has been recognized as a metabolic disease associated with fatty acid metabolic reprogramming, although in-depth studies on this topic are still lacking. We found that fatty acid metabolism reprogramming in renal cell carcinoma is primarily characterized by high expression of FABP1. FABP1 + tumors significantly impact survival and display distinct differentiation trajectories compared to other tumor subclusters. They show elevated expression of angiogenesis and cell migration signals, with PLG-PLAT-mediated interactions with endothelial cells notably enhanced. Spatial transcriptomics show a prominent co-localization of FABP1 + tumors with endothelial cells, and their spatial distribution closely aligns with that of PLAT + endothelial cells. FABP1 + tumors exhibit a unique pattern in spatial transcriptomics, enriched in Extracellular Matrix and angiogenesis-related pathways. Through receptor-ligand interaction analysis, a novel PLG-PLAT functional axis was found between tumor epithelial cells and endothelial cells. Based on results of experiments, we infer that FABP1 + tumors can promote plasmin-related tumor angiogenesis by triggering the PLG-PLAT signaling axis. Finally, utilizing preclinical models, we suggest that targeting the FABP1-PLG-PLAT axis may serve as promising strategy enhancing the sensitivity of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor therapy.

        <tr id="Background Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy, primarily comprising intrahepatic (iCCA) and extrahepatic (eCCA) subtypes. Reconciling the variability between iCCAs and eCCAs in clinical trials remains a challenge, largely due to the inadequate understanding of their shared and subtype-specific cellular heterogeneity. We aim to address this issue using single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomic approaches. Methods We performed comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) by profiling 109,071 single cells from 28 samples, including chronic biliary inflammatory conditions (n = 7) and CCAs from different anatomical sites (n = 21). Findings were validated using external multi-omics datasets, tissue microarray cohort, spatial RNA in situ sequencing, CCA patient-derived organoids (PDOs), and mouse models. Results iCCAs and eCCAs exhibited distinct tumor ecosystems, with notable differences in cellular composition, diversity, and abundance across various cell types. Non-malignant epithelial cells displayed divergent precancer hallmarks from different biliary sites, with inflammatory extrahepatic bile ducts exhibiting early hijacking of the gastrointestinal metaplastic process. We identified seven meta-programs within cancer cells, mapped into four major subtypes. This subtyping was validated using external CCA cohorts and PDO models, distinguishing patients based on clinical outcomes and drug vulnerabilities. Specifically, iCCAs were associated with a senescent program, while eCCAs were enriched in an IFN-responsive program linked to adverse clinical outcomes and increased drug resistance. We identified a basal-like LY6D+ cancer cell subpopulation specific to eCCAs, which displayed significant stemness, drug resistance, and IFN-responsive features. This subpopulation was closely associated with an interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15)-enriched mesenchymal and immune microenvironment. Functional assays demonstrated that ISG15 stimulation significantly boosted stemness, basal-like features, and drug resistance in eCCA cells, highlighting its pivotal role in sustaining the LY6D+ progenitor niches. Conclusion We present a comprehensive single-cell landscape of CCAs, uncovering the molecular heterogeneity between iCCA and eCCA subtypes. Transcriptomic subtyping of CCA cancer cells offers implications for clinical stratification and functional precision oncology. We identify basal-like epithelial progenitors and characterize their associated ISG15-enriched microenvironment in eCCAs. These findings hold significant promise for the development of novel prognostic biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and treatment strategies for CCAs.

By leveraging fluorescent transcriptional reporting of the T cell activation marker Cd69, we defined a classifier for potent versus suboptimal CD69+ activation states arising from T cell stimulation. In tumors, this delineation provided an additional functional readout among TEX subsets, marked by enhanced effector molecule production. The more potent Cd69-TFPhi state was the most prominent in a T cell-mediated tumor clearance model, displaying increased engagement and superior tumor cell killing. Simultaneous analysis of gene and protein expression in human head and neck tumors enabled a similar strategy to identify Cd69RNAhiCD69+ cells with enhanced functional features compared with Cd69RNAloCD69+ cells among intratumoral CD8 T cell subsets. Thus, refining the T cell functional landscape in tumors potentiates the identification of rare, potent effectors that could be leveraged for improving cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, are highly malignant brain tumors with high recurrence rates and poor prognosis. Despite advances in treatment, recurrence remains a major challenge. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in tumor invasion and recurrence. This study explores the transcriptional and regulatory mechanisms driving glioma recurrence, focusing on mesenchymal-like (MES-like) subpopulations. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed on 52 IDH wild-type GBM specimens, including 26 primary and 26 recurrent tumors. Spatial transcriptomics data were also incorporated. Tumor subpopulations were identified through gene regulatory network analysis, copy number variation detection, and nonnegative matrix factorization. Functional validation was conducted using gene knockdown experiments, followed by xenograft studies. We discovered novel MES-like subpopulations in recurrent GBM enriched with EMT-related genes like EGR1 and SERPINE1. These subpopulations exhibited increased transcriptional activity and were associated with poor prognosis and invasiveness. Knockdown of SERPINE1 significantly reduced cell proliferation and migration. Spatial transcriptomics showed MES-like cells concentrated at the tumor margins, highlighting their role in invasion and recurrence. MES-like subpopulations, driven by EGR1 and SERPINE1, are critical in GBM. Targeting these regulators could offer new therapeutic strategies to reduce glioma recurrence and improve outcomes.

        <tr id="Background The heterogeneity of bladder cancer (BLCA) is affected by its inherent transcriptional properties and tumor microenvironment (TME). Stromal transcriptional components in the TME significantly influence the transcriptional classification of BLCA, and the intrinsic biological transcriptional characteristics of cancer cells may be obscured by the dominant, lineage-dependent transcriptional components of stromal origin. This study aimed to explore the degree and mechanisms by which cancer-intrinsic gene expression profiles contribute to the classification and prognosis of BLCA patients. Materials and methods In this study, BLCA single-cell transcriptome data from GSE135337 were used to identify pure tumor cells in BLCA and explore the different intrinsic heterogeneous cell subgroups of BLCA through pathway-based cancer transcriptome classification. Additionally, BLCA intrinsic subtypes were uncovered in the TCGA BLCA dataset based on the characteristic genes of the subgroups. Lastly, various machine learning algorithms were applied to identify novel potential targets of BLCA, following which their pro-tumorigenic effects were experimentally verified. Results Four BLCA intrinsic subtypes with different molecular, functional and phenotypic characteristics were successfully identified. Specifically, MA and DP subtypes demonstrated malignant phenotypes, accompanied by unfavorable clinical prognoses, limited involvement in cell death pathways, marked cell proliferation, and diminished immune activation. Notably, MA subtype exhibited the most favorable response to immunotherapy, potentially attributable to its distinctive tumor immune microenvironment. DSM subtype represented an immune-rich subtype with the optimal prognosis, characterized by abundant immune cells, high levels of co-stimulatory, co-inhibitory, major histocompatibility complex molecules, and a potential for immunotherapy response. On the other hand, HM subtype was associated with a high level of autophagy and necrosis and an “immune-hot” TIME. Furthermore, BLCA intrinsic subtypes effectively classified independent sets of BLCAs, with limited overlap with existing transcriptional classifications and showcasing unprecedented predictive and prognostic value. Finally, the DP subtype, associated with the worst prognosis, was further analyzed, leading to the identification of three potential target genes (DAD1, CYP1B1, and REXO2) significantly associated with metabolic disorders, as well as BLCA stage and grade. Conclusion This study identified a promising platform for understanding intrinsic tumor heterogeneity, which could offer new insights into the intricate molecular mechanisms of BLCA. Targeted therapy against BEXO2 may improve the prognosis of BLCA patients by regulating mitochondria-related metabolic disorders.

To address this, we perform multi-site global proteomics alongside matched immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples. We order the protein expression profiles using an unbiased pseudotime analysis, recapitulating clinical observations of metastatic progression, and providing a framework to explore tumor-immune dynamics from localized to metastatic disease. Metastatic progression correlates with immune cell infiltration, the recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to counterbalance γδ T cell abundance, and an increased abundance of exhausted CD8⁺ T cells. The accumulation of Tregs at metastatic sites correlates with SNX8 expression, a critical regulator of the STING pathway. In early-stage tumors, keratin-expressing cancer cells recruit Tregs via MHC class II, fostering an inflammatory phenotype with limited IFNγ production and non-clonally expanded T cells. Together, our findings reveal novel mechanisms of immune escape associated with both localized disease and metastatic progression in HGSOC.">

However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which DDX41 variants contribute to the pathogenesis of myeloid neoplasms remain poorly understood, partly due to challenges in establishing cellular and animal models that faithfully recapitulate the human disease phenotype. This limitation highlights the necessity of directly analyzing primary human disease cells. In this case report, conducted to pursue this objective, we implemented single-cell RNA sequencing integrated with genotyping at the p.R525 locus in a myelodysplastic neoplasm (MDS) harboring both germline and somatic DDX41 variants, leveraging highly efficient Terminator-Assisted Solid-phase cDNA amplification and sequencing. We found that acquiring p.R525H induced G2/M cell cycle arrest selectively in colony-forming unit-erythroid cells, accompanied by R-loop accumulation, which impaired erythropoiesis through DNA damage. In hematopoietic stem and myeloid progenitor populations, gene expression profiles were largely similar between p.R525H-positive and -negative cells. However, ligand-receptor interaction and transcriptional regulation analyses suggested a non-cell-autonomous influence from p.R525H-expressing cells on GL variant-only cells. This interaction drove convergence toward a shared expression profile, highlighting an intricate interplay shaping the patient’s MDS phenotype.">

 Background:
 Colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most prevalent cancer globally, remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality. Genomic and epigenomic plasticity during CRC progression, particularly metastasis, poses significant challenges to effective treatment. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) reflect the heterogeneous genetic and morphological composition of cancer cells, enabling ex vivo disease modeling. This study investigates the epigenomic makeup of human primary and metastatic CRC to advance precision epigenetic therapies.
 Methods:
 We analyzed 45 organoid models, including 40 CRC organoids (from primary tumors and liver/lung metastases) and 5 generated from healthy colonic tissue. Using integrative epigenomic profiling, including chromatin accessibility, chromatin state mapping (via six histone modifications), and 3D genome conformation, we constructed a comprehensive CRC epigenomic landscape.
 Results:
 Our analysis of CRC patient-derived organoids revealed a core set of accessible genomic regions shared across all organoids, irrespective of tumor location or metastatic status. This conserved chromatin signature highlights common regulatory pathways in CRC during disease progression. Unsupervised clustering based on epigenomic features revealed four distinct CRC subtypes, encompassing both primary and metastatic models. Notably, organoids derived from liver and lung metastases did not cluster by metastatic site, underscoring epigenomic convergence. Subtype D comprised 57.1% (8/14) of primary tumors, while subtypes B and C contained 47.3% (9/19) of liver metastases and 42.8% (3/7) of lung metastases, respectively. KRAS mutation status further stratified subtypes, with wild-type KRAS observed exclusively in subtypes A and B, while KRAS-mutant variants were enriched in subtypes C (6/7) and D (4/10). Histone modification patterns, defined by six marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, H3K36me3, and H3K9me3) revealed subtype-specific regulatory chromatin landscapes. Three-dimensional chromatin interactions were mapped, and genome-wide interaction contacts are used to identify various chromatin structures that may influence metastatic capacity.
 Conclusions:
 This study highlights distinct and shared epigenomic signatures in CRC PDOs, offering novel insights into tumor progression and metastasis. Integrative chromatin analysis provides a framework for identifying epigenetic biomarkers and epigenome targeting strategies.

 Background:
 Follicular lymphoma (FL) exhibits considerable variability in biological features and clinical trajectories, compounded by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) populated with nonmalignant immune cells. In this study, we comprehensively characterized FL by integrating multi-omics data that considered both tumor cells and microenvironmental components. This analysis revealed four subtypes of FL, each exhibiting distinct biological characteristics and differing clinical behaviors.
 Methods:
 Our study included 1,203 samples, 53 bulk transcriptomic samples from our center, 1,150 samples from public databases, and five single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) cohorts. The Ecotyper algorithm was employed to identify immune cell states. Unsupervised clustering analysis using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was performed to identify distinct FL subtypes based on cellular infiltration.
 Results:
 A total of 30 unique cell states were identified from nine annotated cell populations (B cells, plasma cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, Tregs, NK cells, Tfh, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells). Validation was performed across three independent scRNA-seq and bulk transcriptomic cohorts to ensure robustness. Four distinct B cell states were identified, each exhibiting unique gene expression profiles and varying prognostic implications. B cell S2 and S3 were associated with adverse outcomes. Notably, PRDM15 in B cell S2 had the most significant prognostic impact, remaining an independent adverse prognostic factor even after adjustment for m7-FLIPI. Mutational profile analysis demonstrated distinct mutation patterns across B cell states: mutations in CCND3, SPEN, and ARID1A were enriched in B cell S1; CREBBP and STAT6 mutations were prominent in B cell S2; and IRF8 and BCL2 mutations were observed in B cell S4, while no significant mutation enrichment was detected in B cell S3. Similarly, immune cells of the same type yet in different states exhibited functional and clinical heterogeneity. Four subtypes of follicular lymphoma characterized by distinct tumor cell states and varying immune infiltration were identified through unsupervised clustering analysis. FLE1 exhibits characteristics of a "cold tumor" with a high abundance of B cell S2. In contrast, FLE2 and FLE3 show moderate immune infiltration, while FLE4 is marked by abundant immune infiltration and elevated expression of immunosuppressive checkpoint molecules, resembling an "inflammatory" tumor phenotype. Prognostic analysis indicates that FLE1 has the most unfavorable prognosis, followed by FLE4.
 Conclusions:
 Our study stratifies FL patients based on the heterogeneity of tumor cells and the immune microenvironment, proposing an immune-based classification for FL. Targeting CREBBP and PRDM15 may offer promising new strategies for the clinical management of patients exhibiting a "cold tumor" phenotype.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is characterized by high malignancy, and its global incidence is predicted to continue to increase over the past decades. However, the mechanisms underlying ICC pathogenesis and progression remain unclear.


APPROACH AND RESULTS
The training cohort consisted of single-cell sequencing of 12 treatment-naïve ICC samples and spatial transcriptomics of four ICC samples. The validation cohort comprised of RNA-seq data from 87 ICC tumor samples. Finally, we validated our findings via multiplex immunofluorescence, organoids, and mice models both in vivo and in vitro. We found significant heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of ICC patients. ICC cells were classified into five molecular subtypes, and we revealed that aspartate beta-hydroxylase (ASPH) was a marker gene for invasion subtypes. We then selected cepharanthine (CEP) as an ASPH inhibitor that effectively suppressed tumor progression. Regarding the ICC lymphatic metastasis mechanism, we found that tumor cells in N1 lymph nodes highly expressed tumor-specific MHC-II molecules but lacked co-stimulatory factors CD80/CD86, inducing a state of anergy in CD4+ T cells, which might facilitate ICC immune evasion.


CONCLUSIONS
The TME of ICC was heterogeneous. ASPH markedly enhanced ICC invasion The ASPH inhibitor CEP significantly inhibits ICC progression and may serve as a targeted therapeutic drug for ICC. Tumor cells in N1 lymph nodes demonstrate high expression of tumor-specific MHC-II molecules, but silencing of co-stimulatory factors such as CD80/CD86 induces CD4+ T cells into an anergic state. Our study indicated that ASPH and MHC-II may serve as novel therapeutic targets for ICC.">

drive tumor progression. This review explores the morphological evolution of cancer cells as a phenotypic manifestation of
underlying molecular dynamics, drawing on recent advances in evolutionary biology, cytoskeletal remodeling, computational

further modulate cell shape and behavior. High-throughput imaging and machine learning have enabled quantification of both
static and dynamic morphological traits, correlating them with chromosomal instability and clinical outcomes. Morphological
heterogeneity has emerged as a powerful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, with deep learning-derived metrics providing
scalable tools for cancer classification and risk stratification. Collectively, these insights underscore the clinical utility of
integrating morphological analysis with molecular profiling, offering new directions for personalized cancer diagnosis and

        <tr id="Mutated oncogenic Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) antigen is expressed in a large variety of cancers, including pancreatic, colorectal, and pulmonary cancers. The oncogenic KRAS mutations cause malignancies and are usually ubiquitously expressed by all cells of a tumor. The KRAS amino acid substitutions at the positions 12 or 13 are among the most frequent mutations in human cancers. Here, we developed immuno-oncotherapeutic non-integrative lentiviral vectors encoding a segment encompassing KRASG12D, either alone, or associated with antigen carriers. These carriers can improve the intracellular antigen routing to major histocompatibility complex presentation machineries or provide universal helper CD4+ epitopes. Immunotherapy with one of these vectors resulted in significant immune control of tumor growth in colorectal or pulmonary preclinical cancer models, in several murine genetic backgrounds. The antitumor effect was correlated with increased proportions of intra-tumoral hematopoietic cells and notably CD8+ T cells. Although this effect was partial, it was robust, reproducible and advantageously combinable with conventional chemotherapies and immunotherapies to improve antitumor protection. Therefore, this approach shows promise as an immuno-oncotherapy against KRAS-mediated malignant transformation.">

We developed several non-integrative lentiviral vectors encoding optimized immunogen that induce robust T cell responses against neoepitopes derived from murine colorectal tumors. Incorporating proteasome-targeting sequences and 4-alanine spacers between neoepitopes enhanced responses to both dominant and subdominant neoepitopes. Using longer natural sequences encompassing minimal epitopes further improved immunogenicity. These vectors drove complete regression of MC38 tumors expressing the selected neoepitopes and sustained immune memory to prevent relapse. Additionally, these vectors synergized with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) therapy to inhibit wild-type MC38 tumor growth. Variant allele frequency tracking demonstrated T cells eradicated neoantigen-positive cells without affecting negative ones.

Here, we applied multicohort single-cell and spatial RNA-seq methods together with patient-derived organoid models to reveal the TME heterogeneity between HU and BT PDAC. Osteopontin, encoded by SPP1, is secreted by vessel endothelial cells in BT PDAC and is associated with increased tumor burden. The number of tumor cells marked by CRABP2 was lower in BT PDAC and was identified as a prognostic marker of overall survival, as well as CD8+ T-cell infiltration. The expression of CRABP2 was also validated to be downregulated in BT PDAC in patient-derived organoid models. Overall, we profiled the heterogeneous PDAC TME between HU and BT PDAC, which could provide novel insight into the relationships between clinical characteristics and TME molecular research.">

        <tr id="Chromoanagenesis is a catastrophic genomic phenomenon involving sudden, extensive rearrangements within one or a few cell cycles. In osteosarcoma, the most prevalent malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents, these events dramatically alter the genomic landscape, frequently disrupting key tumor suppressor genes like TP53 and RB1, amplifying oncogene expression, and propelling tumor progression and evolution. This review elucidates how key chromoanagenic mechanisms, such as chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis, arise from replication stress and impaired DNA repair pathways, ultimately contributing to genomic instability in osteosarcoma. Chromothripsis features prominently in osteosarcoma, occurring in up to 62% of tumor regions and driving intratumoral heterogeneity through persistent genomic crises. Next-generation sequencing, optical genome mapping, and emerging technologies like single-cell sequencing empower researchers to detect and characterize these complex structural variants, demonstrating how a single catastrophic event can profoundly influence osteosarcoma progression over time. While targeted therapies for osteosarcoma have proven elusive, innovative strategies harnessing comprehensive genomic profiling and patient-derived preclinical models hold promise for uncovering tumor-specific vulnerabilities tied to chromoanagenesis. Ultimately, unraveling how these rapid, large-scale rearrangements fuel osteosarcoma’s aggressive nature will not only refine disease classification and prognosis but also pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches to enhance patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and deadly malignancies worldwide, with a particularly low 5-year survival rate in advanced patients. Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, especially mast cells, play crucial roles in tumor initiation and progression. However, the dual role of mast cells in CRC remains poorly understood. Methods In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), bulk RNA sequencing, and bioinformatics analyses to explore the heterogeneity of mast cell subpopulations in the CRC tumor microenvironment and their relationship with prognosis. We analyzed gene expression signatures associated with mast cell subpopulations derived from single-cell data of 40 CRC tumor samples and combined bulk RNA-seq data from HMU, GEO, and TCGA cohorts for prognostic prediction. Non-negative matrix factorization was used for clustering of mast cell subpopulations, followed by analysis of their specific gene markers, transcription factor activity, and biological pathways. Survival analysis and ROC curves were performed to assess their prognostic significance. Results Mast cells in the CRC tumor microenvironment were classified into three distinct subpopulations, each with unique gene markers and functional pathways. Mast cell subpopulations 1 and 3 were highly associated with pro-tumor pathways, while mast cell subpopulation 2 primarily exhibited anti-tumor immune regulatory characteristics. High expression of mast cell subpopulations 1 and 3 was associated with poor survival prognosis, while high expression of subpopulation 2 was linked to a better survival outcome. Key marker genes such as DNAJB1, SEMA7A, and XCR1 were identified as potential prognostic factors, with high expression of DNAJB1 and SEMA7A being significantly associated with poor prognosis, while high expression of XCR1 was linked to a favorable prognosis. Conclusion This study reveals the functional heterogeneity of mast cell subpopulations in the CRC tumor microenvironment and their differential roles in tumor progression. Identification of mast cell subpopulation-specific marker genes provides new molecular targets for clinical diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and personalized immunotherapy in CRC.

These models largely retain the genetic, phenotypic, and microenvironmental features of the original tumors, providing valuable insights into disease progression, drug response, and resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, by enabling tumors’ spatiotemporal molecular profiling, PDOs and CTCs offer a dynamic approach to assess treatment efficacy over time. However, to fully capture the complexity of breast cancer heterogeneity, it is required to develop models from multiple tumor and blood samples collected throughout the course of treatment. This review explores the potential of integrating PDOs and CTC models to better understand intra-tumor heterogeneity while addressing key challenges in developing patient-derived models that accurately recapitulate patients’ tumors to advance personalized care. The integration of PDOs and CTCs could represent a paradigm shift in the personalized management of metastatic breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Brain tumors, in particular gliomas and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are thought to originate from different cells facing specific founding insults, a feature that partly justifies the complexity and heterogeneity of these severe forms of cancer. However, gliomas and GBM are usually reproduced in animal models by inducing molecular alterations in mature glial cells, which, though being part of the puzzle, do not represent the whole picture. To fill this conceptual gap, we previously developed a neurogenic model of brain cancer in Drosophila, demonstrating that the loss of cell polarity in neural stem cells (called neuroblasts in the fruit fly) is sufficient to promote the formation of malignant masses that continue to grow in the adult, displaying several phenotypic traits typical of human GBM. Here, we expand on previous work by restricting polarity disruption to Drosophila type II neuroblasts, whose self-renewal is comparable to that of mammalian neural progenitors, with the aim to capture the molecular signature of the resulting cancers in a specific and reproducible context. A comparison of the most deregulated transcripts with those found in human primary GBMs confirmed that our model can be proficiently used to delve into the roots of human brain tumorigenesis.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks third in global incidence and second in mortality, with rates increasing among younger populations. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is crucial for gastrointestinal function, and its dysfunction is associated with the progression of CRC. Neurodegeneration may disrupt ENS function and facilitate tumor growth although the mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS AND MATERIALS This study integrated single-nucleus, single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and bulk transcriptomics data. Summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis identified neurodegeneration-related genes associated with CRC progression. Cell-cell communication was analyzed using CellCall and Cytotalk, and trajectory analysis performed using VECTOR. ST analysis was conducted using robust cell type decomposition, and spatial dependencies were assessed through MISTy and cell neighborhood network analyses. A deep learning–based prognostic model was developed using DeepSurv. Multiplex immunofluorescence was used to validate the functions of cells. RESULTS SMR analysis identified seven neurodegeneration-related genes, including MAPK9, associated with the development of CRC. High-neurodegeneration neurons were associated with poorer prognoses and infiltrated deeper into tumor niches. MISTy analysis revealed stronger spatial dependencies between high-neurodegeneration neurons and epithelial cells. Homotypic and heterotypic cell neighborhood network analyses revealed tighter neuron networks in high-degeneration groups, with enhanced neuron-epithelial communication. MAPK9-positive neurons were highly expressed in sensory neurons and facilitated tumor growth via EGFR signaling. The DeepSurv model demonstrated strong prognostic performance, with high-risk patients exhibiting worse outcomes and elevated expression of immune checkpoint genes. CONCLUSION Neurodegeneration, particularly involving MAPK9-positive neurons, promotes CRC progression through enhanced neuron-tumor interactions and EGFR signaling. This study underscores the significance of targeting neurodegeneration in CRC treatment.">

 Background:
 Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major global health concern due to its high prevalence and mortality, especially in advanced stages. Despite advancements such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, resistance and tumor heterogeneity remain significant obstacles. Recent research highlights the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) signaling pathway as a crucial factor in T cell exhaustion, which weakens the immune system’s anti-tumor response. Inhibiting this pathway could restore immune function against CRC. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enhanced understanding of the tumor microenvironment, offering new opportunities for discovering biomarkers and therapeutic targets for personalized treatment strategies.
 Methods:
 We applied scRNA-seq and bulk RNA sequencing to examine adrenergic receptor signaling in CRC, particularly before and after neoadjuvant therapy. Bioinformatics analyses identified T cells expressing ADRB2, confirmed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Copy number variation (CNV) analysis detected malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment, and intercellular communication studies were conducted to explore interactions between ADRB2+ T cells and other immune cells. RNA scope was employed to map ADRB2 distribution in tissue samples. Additionally, deconvolution of TCGA data revealed important immune cell populations, helping to build a prognostic model based on adrenergic receptor signaling and therapy-induced gene expression changes.
 Results:
 The adrenergic receptor signaling pathway was notably enriched in immune cells, especially T cells. After neoadjuvant therapy, scRNA-seq revealed a significant increase in ADRB2 expression in T cells. RNA scope validated ADRB2 co-localization with T cells in CRC tissues, while flow cytometry showed increased ADRB2 expression alongside markers of T cell exhaustion and reduced immune function. CNV analysis identified malignant populations within the tumor microenvironment. Studies of intercellular interactions suggested that ADRB2+ T cells contribute to immune suppression. TCGA data deconvolution indicated that ADRB2+ T cells and CD44+ tumor cells are critical for prognosis. The resulting prognostic model, integrating adrenergic signaling and post-treatment gene expression changes, demonstrated strong predictive power for patient outcomes.
 Conclusions:
 Increased ADRB2 expression in T cells after neoadjuvant therapy in CRC correlates with poor prognosis. This positions ADRB2 as a promising prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy effectiveness following neoadjuvant treatment. Targeting ADRB2 could offer novel approaches to alleviate immune exhaustion and improve patient outcomes.

 Background:
 Beyond their vascular function, endothelial cells (ECs) regulate tumor growth through recently described angiocrine signaling, influencing cancer progression and treatment outcomes. Here, we applied a deep learning model, which we validated using spatial transcriptomics data, to a pan-cancer dataset to analyze the EC distribution associated with the response to immuno-oncology (IO) treatments.
 Methods:
 An AI-powered H&E analyzer, Lunit SCOPE IO, quantifies tumor microenvironment EC density and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) density in cancer epithelium and stroma. We validated AI-powered cell type prediction by evaluating cell-specific gene expression through spatial transcriptomics (10x Xenium). 7,467 pan-carcinoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed for EC distribution and overall survival (OS). From a previously described multi-center, multi-national pan-cancer cohort (Pan-IO, Shen et al JITC 2024), 1,654 patients were analyzed for IO treatment response.
 Results:
 We validated our AI prediction of cell types by demonstrating consistency with known cardinal gene expressions from spatial transcriptomic results, where 77.5% of AI-predicted endothelial cells (ECs) expressed VEGFR2 (compared to 6.9% in tumor cells (TCs)), while VEGFA expression was 2.8 times higher in TCs. Consistent with previous studies, EC density was highest in RCC and HCC, while lowest in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. While EC and TIL density were not correlated pan-cancer (r = 0.08), exceptions were head and neck cancer (r = 0.45, p < 0.001) and pancreatic cancer (r = 0.44, p < 0.001). In the TCGA cohort, the high EC density was associated with prolonged OS (HR 0.84, p < 0.001). In contrast, within the Pan-IO cohort (HR 1.26, p < 0.001) and its lung cancer subgroup (HR 1.26, p < 0.001) high EC density was associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) on treatment with IO monotherapy. Moreover, the predictive impact of EC density varied by TIL status. In the Pan-IO cohort, EC density predicted PFS in both TIL-high (HR 1.40, p < 0.001) and TIL-low cancers (HR 1.33, p < 0.001). Among four groups divided by median values, the EC-low and TIL-high group showed the longest PFS (median PFS of EC/TIL high/low: 2.5m, high/high: 3.2m, low/low: 3.6m, low/high: 5.6m, p < 0.001).
 Conclusions:
 EC distribution varied among cancer types, and importantly high EC content strongly correlated with poor IO monotherapy response, including NSCLC. These findings support exploring immunotherapy combination strategies that include anti-endothelial approaches, which could encompass the emerging class of PD-1/VEGFR bispecifics, for tumors with high EC content. Early evidence was observed for this for HCC (Chon et al ASCO GI 2024), with a hazard ratio of 0.62 for high EC HCC for atezolizumab/bevacizumab.

        <tr id="Tumor diseases are characterized by high interindividual and intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH). The development and progression of neoplasms outline complex networks of extracellular and cellular signals that have yet to be fully elucidated. This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature related to the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of the tumor mass. Furthermore, it examines the possible role of the tumor microenvironment in the development and support of the neoplasm, in order to highlight its potential in the construction of a diagnostic–therapeutic approach to precision medicine. Many authors underline the importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) as it actively takes part in the growth of the neoplastic mass and in the formation of metastases and in the acquisition of resistance to anticancer drugs. In specific body districts, the ideal conditions occur for the TME establishment, particularly the inflammatory state, the recruitment of cell types, the release of specific cytokines and growth factors, hypoxic conditions. These components actively intervene by enabling tumor progression and construction of physical barriers shaped by the extracellular matrix that contribute to forming peripheral tolerance by intervention of myeloid precursors and the polarization of M2 macrophages. In recent years, ITH and the TME have assumed an important position in cancer research and pharmacology as they enable understanding the dense network of communication existing between the neoplasm and the surrounding environment, and to monitor and deepen the effects of drugs with a view to develop increasingly precise and effective therapies. In the last decade, knowledge of TME has been exploited to produce targeted molecular agents (inhibitory small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy). Nonetheless, the bibliography shows the need to study ITH through new prognostic and predictive biomarkers (e.g., ctDNA and CTCs) and to increase its basic biology knowledge. Precision medicine is a new opportunity in the treatment of oncological diseases that is transforming the development of new drug approaches and their clinical use.

        <tr id="Background PERP may have the potential to function as an oncogene. However, the precise function, prognostic value, and predictive significance remain shrouded in ambiguity. Methods We conducted an in-depth analysis using pan-cancer RNA sequencing data and various online web tools to investigate the correlation between PERP and crucial clinical outcomes such as prognosis, tumor microenvironment, and tumor metabolism. In addition, we explored the tumor-promoting role of PERP and its potential mechanisms through models such as immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, cell proliferation assays, wound healing assays, cell migration assays, mass spectrometry analysis and isotope tracing. Further in vivo models confirmed the functional consistency of PERP across pan-cancer. Finally, we analyzed the potential of PERP as a predictive factor for immunotherapy sensitivity in a clinical cohort. Results PERP exhibits elevated expression in the majority of cancer types and impedes immune cell infiltration as well as immune checkpoint reactivity in pan-cancer. We confirmed that PERP can promote tumor progression by tumor cell proliferation, scratch and transwell experiments. Meanwhile, the absence of PERP restricts the flux of 13C6-glucose into glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Importantly, the deficiency of PERP enhances the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of PD1 monoclonal antibodies. In addition, low PERP expression is highly correlated with the response of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients to immunotherapy. Conclusions PERP represents a promising predictive/diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HNSCC patients.

        <tr id="Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway can be observed in various malignancies, particularly in stroma-rich tumors like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In PDAC, Hh signaling is thought to foster an abundant stroma, making it an appealing target for stoma-targeted therapy. However, the use of Hh antagonists in the clinic has thus far not been successful. To reassess the clinical merit of Hh-targeted therapy in PDAC, we sought to better characterize the role of Hh signaling in tumor-stroma crosstalk. Here, we show that Hh ligands are not prognostic per se in PDAC, despite being associated with the favorable classical molecular subtype. Perturbing Hh ligand expression in PDAC cells can effectively alter their trans-signaling capacity but does not impact tumor growth in vivo. However, co-injecting PDAC cells with Smo-proficient MEFs resulted in a significant reduction in xenograft growth, suggesting that Hh-related effects on tumor growth are largely mediated through the stroma. By analyzing transcriptomic sequencing data from co-cultures, comprising human PDAC cells and mouse fibroblasts treated with a Hh-blocking antibody, we could identify stromal hits that are responsive to Hh ligands. We then leveraged the obtained set of genes to allow patient stratification based on stromal response to Hh ligands. We believe that a subset of PDAC patients may benefit from the use of Hh-targeted therapies and thereby encourage the use of our stratification tool to guide their use in PDAC clinical care.">

        <tr id="
 Breast cancer exhibits heterogeneity at various levels, from subtype differences between patients (inter-patient heterogeneity) to diverse malignant cell compositions, variability in hormone receptor (HR) expression, and cellular makeup within single breast cancer samples (intra-tumour heterogeneity). Despite the availability of numerous effective therapies, many patients still experience incomplete treatment responses and subsequent relapse. These adverse outcomes are often due to the critical but frequently overlooked factor of cellular heterogeneity.
 To gain deeper insights into intra-tumour heterogeneity, we applied single-cell technologies to a cohort of 250 primary, untreated breast cancers. We optimized tissue cryopreservation methods, eliminating the need for fresh sample processing, and developed multiplex tissue profiling techniques. These cost-efficient processes improve handling of small tissue sizes, such as biopsies, and reduce batch effects. To ensure accurate and reliable data processing, we created a scalable computational workflow that includes benchmarked methods for sample SNP-demultiplexing, doublet detection, high-resolution cell annotation, and cellular integration. Additionally, we extended our existing methods to study the cellular heterogeneity of breast cancers.
 Our method, scSubtyper, examines the phenotypic differences between malignant cells within tumours by comparing each single cell to features associated with different molecular subtypes and assigning each cell to one of these subtypes. Our previous study and preliminary results from this project revealed that over 90% of samples exhibit a mix of malignant cells of different subtypes, and 50% of samples contain cells with characteristics of all subtypes, demonstrating that cellular heterogeneity exists not only between malignant cells but also within malignant cells of a tumour. Our second approach, known as ecotyping, assesses patterns of cell type frequencies across samples and groups them based on the similarity of these co-occurrences. Preliminary results have revealed the existence of five ecotypes that lack significant associations with clinical subtypes. Application of the same approach exclusively within the HR-positive samples identified four ecotypes characterized by distinct abundances of immune and stromal cells. This analysis revealed that ecotypes are not simple surrogates for clinical and molecular subtypes, but their presence could influence different responses to treatment.
 Together, our high-throughput tissue processing and computational approaches to study intra-tumour heterogeneity are now being applied to our large, well-annotated clinical cohort. Supported by preliminary results, we hypothesize that this study will play a vital role in optimizing breast cancer patient stratification to improve treatment management and outcomes.

        <tr id="Drug sensitivity is a major determinant influencing the efficiency of cancer treatment, and its evaluation faces critical challenges due to the cancer cell heterogeneity. Herein, a droplet-driven compartmentalization array (SCellEV chip) is presented to uncover single-cell trastuzumab sensitivity. Leveraging the differential flow resistance principle, the chip enables the flexible generation of single droplets orderly situated at designated spots. The single droplet includes parallel hydrodynamic microtraps empowers efficient compartments for single cell capture, and culture, and employs aptCD63-functionalized microbeads to immune-affinity capture single cell extracellular vesicles (EVs). The pairing capture of single cells and their EVs using single beads allows simultaneous identification of EVs and their original cells. The protein profiles (HER2 and CD63) and anti-cancer drug challenge revealed the cellular/EVs secretion heterogeneity at the single cell level and cell susceptibility to trastuzumab, further confirming that this chip achieves discriminating and predicting single breast cancer cells with different trastuzumab sensitivity using single cell/EVs profiling strategy. Furthermore, this analysis process retains the cell viability of measured cells to promote downstream detection integration. Overall, the SCellEV chip offers new avenues for single-cell analysis and exhibits great potential for cancer diagnostic and targeted treatment.">

        <tr id="Evolution and outgrowth of drug-resistant cancer cells is a common cause of treatment failure. Patients with leukemic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (L-CTCL) have a poor prognosis due to development of drug-resistance and severe bacterial infections. Here, we show that most L-CTCL patients harbor multiple genetically distinct subclones that express an identical clonal antigen receptor but display distinct phenotypes and functional properties. These co-existing malignant subclones exhibit differences in tissue homing, metabolism, and cytokine expression, and respond differently to extrinsic factors like Staphylococcus (S.)aureus and cancer drugs. Indeed, while S. aureus toxins selectively enhance activation and proliferation of certain subclones, these responsive subclones are also the most intrinsically sensitive to cancer drugs when the stimuli are removed. Consequently, although divergent evolution of malignant subclones drives aggressiveness, adaptability and drug-resistance, by removing extrinsic stimuli and mapping malignant subclones, we can expose inherent vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the treatment of these cancers.">

 Background:
 Detecting clinically relevant biomarkers in cancer tissues provides key insights into the unique tumor characteristics of patients, allowing for more personalized and effective therapies. Clinical biomarkers such as PD-1 and PD-L1 are associated with an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), whereas HER2 is associated with metastasis and recurrence in multiple types of cancers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the gold-standard technique for biomarker detection and is widely used by pathologists to grade tissue expression. Limitations related to plexity, quantitation and false signal detection are frequently observed using IHC, and day-to-day variability due to signal amplification and false positive signal can misinform pathologists about biomarker expression. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) technology is a multiplexed spatial imaging technique that incorporates stoichiometric and quantitative assessment of 40-plus biomarkers simultaneously on a single slide and offers a large dynamic range of signal detection. We strove to determine whether IMC based spatial proteomics can be used for pathological evaluation of PD-1, PD-L1 and HER2 and provide key biological insights for clinical and translational studies.
 Methods:
 We stained serial sections of tissues using the same antibody clone and generated IHC and IMC data, which was assessed by a board-certified pathologist. For IMC technology, we detected single cells using the Human Immuno-Oncology IMC Panel, which highlights individual tumor, immune and stromal components of the TME. We conducted quantitative image analysis to detect expression of relevant biomarkers on cells and found enriched cellular neighborhoods associated with various pro- and antitumor processes.
 Results:
 Our analysis demonstrated that IMC technology and IHC similarly detected PD-1 and PD-L1. However, IMC accomplished it without signal amplification. For HER2, IMC technology and IHC provided comparable data. However, IMC detected the true dynamic range of signal intensities. Quantitative comparison of IMC technology combined with single-cell spatial proteomic analysis resolved the location of PD-1-, PD-L1- and HER2-expressing cells relative to other immune, stromal and tumor cell populations and offered additional biological insights into disease mechanisms.
 Conclusions:
 Clinical assessment of tissues using IMC technology offers an advantage over IHC by providing true biological context through multiplexing capabilities. High-dimensional spatially resolved data offered by IMC technology has the potential to expand our understanding of disease mechanisms of cancers and expedite development of personalized therapies for cancer patients in the clinic.

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Mechanisms of HIV persistence in tissues are distinct from that in the blood. Spatial transcriptomic profiling examines HIV-infected cells, surrounding neighborhoods, and tissue microenvironment in unprecedented resolution. Spatial profiling captures cytokine gradients, distances between HIV-infected cells and immune effectors (and their function versus exhaustion), and cell-cell interactions. We present an overview of spatial transcriptomic platforms and a workflow of quality controls, sanity check, and bioinformatic analysis.


RECENT FINDINGS
The selection of spatial profiling methods should base on the research question, resolution, breadth of coverage, the expression level of RNA of interest, tissue quality, and tissue size. Advanced spatial transcriptomic profiling can capture RNA molecules at high resolution (<1 μm) and thus enable near-single cell profiling at genome-wide (~20 000 genes) breadth. Specifically, poly-A-based mRNA capture can identify previously unknown targets, while targeted RNA capture increases sensitivity in low-quality tissues. In targeted capture, however, the increase in target numbers frequently decreases sensitivity. Coupling ATAC-seq, protein capture, and T cell receptor sequencing to spatial platforms is ongoing.


SUMMARY
Spatial transcriptomic profiling uncovers mechanisms of HIV persistence in tissues and informs therapeutic strategies. Investigators should ensure the rigor of analysis, validate findings, and avoid reporting signatures with unknown biological significance.">

        <tr id="Background Melanoma is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with diverse molecular and clinical behaviors. A precise molecular classification is critical for improving prognostic assessment and guiding personalized therapy. Methods We performed an integrative multi-omics analysis of skin cutaneous melanoma using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and validated our findings in independent cohorts. Multi-layered data, including transcriptomic, genomic, epigenetic, and immune landscape profiles, were analyzed using unsupervised clustering and machine learning approaches to define molecular subtypes. Functional assays and in silico drug screening were employed to explore subtype-specific vulnerabilities. Results Three robust molecular subtypes (CS1, CS2, CS3) were identified, each with distinct genomic alterations, tumor microenvironment characteristics, and clinical outcomes. The CS2 subtype was immunologically “hot,” characterized by high tumor mutational burden (TMB), elevated neoantigen load, strong immune infiltration, and activated IFN-γ signaling. CS2 tumors showed significant enrichment of immune checkpoint gene expression and were associated with favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy in external validation cohorts. In contrast, CS1 and CS3 were immunologically “cold” with immune exclusion, high chromosomal instability, and activation of oncogenic pathways linked to immune evasion. Transcriptomic drug sensitivity modeling suggested that CS1 and CS3 may benefit from HSP90 or MEK inhibitors. Moreover, COL11A2 was identified as a subtype-enriched oncogenic driver predominantly expressed in CS1/CS3, and its silencing impaired tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) features. Conclusions This study presents a refined multi-omics classification of melanoma that reveals biologically and clinically distinct subtypes with divergent immune and therapeutic profiles. It offers a framework for subtype-specific treatment strategies, and identifies COL11A2 as a potential target in immune-cold melanomas.">

        <tr id="Background Meningioma (MEN) is one of the most common intracranial tumors, with a significantly higher incidence rate in females than in males. Although the majority of cases are benign, tumors located in complex anatomical regions or classified as atypical or malignant have a high recurrence rate, underscoring the need to optimize therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes. Therefore, this study utilizes single-cell RNA-sequencing technology to investigate the interaction mechanisms between endothelial cells (ECs) and meningiomas, aiming to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of MEN patients. Methods Tissue origin analysis of different EC subpopulations was performed using Ro/e preference analysis. Gene Ontology and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were employed to enrich and identify relevant biological processes. Slingshot and CytoTRACE were used to determine the differentiation trajectories of cell subpopulations. CellChat was utilized to predict intercellular communication between EC subpopulations and meningioma cells (MGCs). The transcription factor (TF) networks of EC subpopulations were constructed using pySCENIC, and the function of ETS1 was validated in vitro experiments. Results The MEN and temporal lobe tissues’ datasets were processed through quality control and screening, and dimensionality reduction clustering identified eight cell types. We found that ECs might play a role in MEN progression and further classified them into four subpopulations. Among these, the C2 PLVAP+ ECs were predominantly located at the later stages of differentiation in the Slingshot analysis, suggesting a critical role in MEN’s development. Cell communication analysis revealed that MGCs might stimulate ECs to secrete angiopoietin via the MDK-NCL ligand-receptor pair, promoting angiogenesis and MEN’s progression. Using pySCENIC analysis, the key TF ETS1 was identified. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ETS1 promoted ECs angiogenesis, proliferation, and migration, providing valuable insights for clinical strategies targeting MEN’s treatment. Conclusion We identified a key ECs subpopulation, C2 PLVAP+ ECs, which was at a critical stage of MEN progression and might influence MEN development through the MK signaling pathway via the MDK-NCL ligand-receptor pair. Additionally, we discovered the critical TF ETS1 and validated through in vitro experiments that it promoted MEN’s progression, offering a new perspective for clinical treatment strategies.">

Evolutionary tree analysis revealed the dynamic appearance and disappearance of functionally and genetically diverse cell subgroups during the progression from epithelial dysplasia to in situ carcinoma and invasive cancer. Key findings include the identification of specific switch genes associated with tumor invasion and the revelation of significant intratumor heterogeneity.This spatial transcriptomic analysis of 4NQO-induced tongue cancer provides a detailed characterization of tumor evolution and heterogeneity. It elucidates critical aspects of tongue cancer cell behavior and identifies potential therapeutic targets (switch genes).

        <tr id="Neuroblastomas are highly heterogeneous tumors originating from neural crest-derived cells destined to form the sympathetic nervous system. Nearly half of high-risk tumors present with amplification of the MYCN proto-oncogene. Here, we describe a Mycn-driven, transplantable, non-germline, genetically engineered mouse model (Mycn-nGEMM). Mycn-nGEMM tumors recapitulate the immune-evasive, macrophage-rich tumor microenvironment of high-risk, MYCN-amplified human neuroblastoma. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with anti-PD-L1, but not anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4, inhibited tumor growth, profoundly remodeling the tumor microenvironment by depleting anti-inflammatory macrophages and increasing T cell infiltration. Surprisingly, while tumor cells showed low expression of PD-L1, anti-inflammatory macrophages from both murine and human neuroblastoma expressed PD-L1. We identified cytokines, including macrophage migration inhibitory factor, secreted by the Mycn-nGEMM cancer cells that drive expression of PD-L1 on macrophages. Combining anti-PD-L1 with CD40 agonist antibodies further improved survival in Mycn-nGEMM mice, demonstrating the potential for myeloid-targeting immunotherapies to overcome inhibitory barriers in immune-evasive neuroblastoma.">

 DNA methylation, an essential epigenetic modification, plays a critical role in establishing and maintaining cellular identities by regulating gene expression. In cancer, aberrant DNA methylation patterns contribute to tumor development and progression, yet the cell-type-specific methylation alterations within the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain poorly understood. In breast cancer, a highly heterogeneous malignancy, endothelial cells within the TME (TECs) are key players in tumor angiogenesis and progression. Methylation changes detected in bulk tumor analyses, however, reflect signals from multiple cell types present in the TME, making it challenging to pinpoint cell-type-specific epigenetic changes. Recently, methods have been developed to using DNA methylation to deconvolute cell type proportions which can in turn be used to attribute methylation alterations to specific cell types in the TME. A reference-based cell-type deconvolution algorithm, the Hierarchical Tumor Immune Microenvironment Epigenetic Deconvolution (HiTIMED) method, allows accurate quantification of cell type proportions within the TME. We accessed DNA methylation array data from 609 breast tumors and 331 nontumor normal breast tissues from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal. To these DNA methylation profiles, we applied HiTIMED and measured tumor and non-tumor cell proportions. Then, applying a statistical interaction model called CellDMC we leveraged the cell type proportion data to identify differential methylation specific to cell types in the breast cancer TME, including TECs and tumor cells. We identified 1897 tumor-cell-specific and 180 TEC-specific differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) in cancer compared to normal breast tissue (FDR ≤ 1e-10). Importantly, in the cell-type unadjusted differential analysis, tumors exhibited hypermethylation compared to normal tissues; however, in the tumor-cell-specific analysis, tumor cells were hypomethylated relative to normal samples. By applying these advanced techniques to breast cancer samples, our study unveils cell-type-specific DNA methylation changes that are pivotal in driving the pro-tumorigenic environment. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer progression but also highlight potential therapeutic targets within the TME. The integration of HiTIMED and CellDMC represents a significant methodological advancement in cancer epigenetics, offering a more precise and insightful approach to studying the complex interplay between different cell types within the TME.

Although the role of mitochondrial proteins in cancer has garnered increasing attention, their specific functions in the nervous system, particularly in gliomas, remain poorly understood. Methods We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing with cellular assays and flow cytometry to investigate the molecular characteristics and cellular interactions within glioblastoma subpopulations during tumor progression. Results Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within glioblastoma subpopulations. Trajectory analysis identified CHCHD2P9 as a pivotal marker for the terminal subpopulation. Moreover, elevated expression of CHCHD2P9 was found to correlate with poorer clinical outcomes. Subsequent cellular experiments further explored the underlying mechanisms driving these observations. Conclusions CHCHD2P9 is significantly overexpressed in glioma patients, and its differential expression plays a crucial role in regulating glioma cell proliferation and migration. A CHCHD2P9-based risk model holds promise as both a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target, providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of gliomas and opening avenues for personalized treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Today, cell therapies are constantly evolving and providing new options for cancer patients. These therapies are mostly based on the inoculation of immune cells extracted from a person’s own tumor; however, some studies using whole tumor cell-based vaccines are approaching the level of maturity required for clinical use. Although these latest therapies will have to be developed further and adapted to overcome many ethical barriers, there is no doubt that therapeutic cancer vaccines are the next frontier of immunotherapy. Methods Ionizing radiation and CD47 knockout via CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing were used to optimize the macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of breast cancer cells. These cells were subsequently used in several mouse models to determine their potential as novel whole-cell-based vaccines to drive antitumor immunity. To improve the recognition of tumor cells by activated immune cells, this cellular therapy was combined with anti-PD-1 antibody treatments. Results Here, we showed that irradiation of 4T1 breast cancer cells increases their immunogenicity and, when injected into the blood of immunocompetent mice, elicits a complete antitumor immune response mediated, in part, by the adaptive immune system. Next, to improve the macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of breast cancer cells, we knocked out CD47 in 4T1 cells. When injected in the bloodstream, irradiated CD47 knockout cells activated both the adaptive and the innate immune systems. Therefore, we used these ex vivo engineered cells as a whole tumor cell-based vaccine to treat breast tumors in immunocompetent mice. A better response was obtained when these cells were combined with an anti-PD-1 antibody. Conclusion These results suggest that tumor cells obtained from surgical samples of a breast cancer patient could be engineered ex vivo and used as a novel cell therapy to drive antitumor immunity.

 Background:
 Recent advances in computational pathology have revolutionized the analysis of histopathology images, enabling precise and rapid clinical outcome predictions. However, a significant challenge persists in translating computational insights into biologically meaningful data that informs clinical decisions. Human-interpretable image features (HIFs) have emerged as a solution, offering a detailed view of the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we explored how HIFs derived from high-resolution histopathology images can predict the expression of genes associated with poor survival outcomes in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), aiming to bridge the gap between computational pathology and actionable clinical insights.
 Methods:
 Whole-slide histopathology images of STAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas were analyzed. Expert pathologists annotated labels were used to identify tissue types like cancer, stroma, necrosis, and normal tissue and cell types, including cancer cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, and fibroblasts. Using these annotations, convolutional neural networks were trained to classify these tissue and cell types, from which HIFs were extracted reflecting the biological composition of the TME, such as cell density ratios relative to surrounding tissues. We then identified genes with strong correlations to HIFs (ρ > 0.5) for further analysis.
 Results:
 Our results revealed high expression of four genes
 ABCA6, ABCA8, ADAM33,
 and
 ADAMTS10
 that were significantly associated with poor survival outcomes in STAD (p < 0.01). Each gene demonstrated a strong correlation (ρ > 0.5 and p = < 0.01) with specific HIFs.
 ABCA6
 and
 ABCA8
 , genes involved in lipid transport, are linked to a high fibroblast-to-stroma density ratio. This stromal-dominant environment is a hallmark of therapy resistance and poor outcomes.
 ADAM33
 and
 ADAMTS10
 , proteases involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, were strongly correlated (ρ > 0.5a and p = < 0.01) with a high macrophage-to-stroma density ratio. This feature represents an immunosuppressive TME, often seen in aggressive and invasive cancers.
 Conclusions:
 These findings underscore the power of HIFs to reveal key TME characteristics. A stromal-dominant TME, defined by elevated
 ABCA6
 and
 ABCA8
 , and an immunosuppressive, macrophage-rich environment associated with increased
 ADAM33
 and
 ADAMTS10
 , serve as markers of disease aggressiveness and poor prognosis. By integrating these insights into AI-driven models, clinicians may identify high-risk patients earlier in their treatment journey, enabling personalized treatment strategies to improve outcomes for STAD patients.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Despite extensive research efforts, glioblastoma (GBM) remains a deadly disease with poor prognosis. Although previous studies have identified various cell states within GBM tumors, the molecular mechanism underlying adaptive GBM cell plasticity induced by conventional therapy remains unclear.


METHODS
We used fluorescent reporters for proneural (PN) and mesenchymal (MES) subtypes to monitor GBM cell plasticity in real-time across multiple patient-derived cell lines. This approach revealed cells that concurrently expressed both proneural and mesenchymal markers. To investigate this unique hybrid population, we implemented a comprehensive methodological approach encompassing bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell ChIP sequencing, nuclear proteomics, high-resolution imaging, orthotopic mouse models, clinical dataset analysis, and pharmacological and genetic techniques. This multifaceted strategy allowed us to gain functional and molecular insights into this distinct cellular population.


RESULTS
We showed that these hybrid cells are increased by conventional therapies, and are resistant to these therapies. At the molecular level, hybrid cells display significant alterations in chromatin structure and nuclear protein composition, elevated transcriptional activity, Myc activation, and improved transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Genetic and pharmaceutical inhibition of the nuclear import/export shuttling machinery, increased in hybrid cells, effectively suppressed adaptive GBM cell plasticity and hybrid identity, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of GBM cells to therapies.


CONCLUSION
Our results indicate that GBM hybrid cells play a crucial role in chemoradiation resistance. The nuclear transport machinery presents a potential therapeutic target for hybrid cells, offering a way to counteract the typical resistance to treatment observed in GBM.">

        <tr id="Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality despite advances in treatments, necessitating more effective therapeutic strategies. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized our ability to dissect the cellular complexity of cancers, which is often obscured in conventional bulk transcriptomic experiments. Methods: In this study, we performed an integrative analysis of scRNA-seq data from multiple LUAD patient cohorts to investigate cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes across disease stages. Clustering, lineage trajectory analysis, and transcriptional regulatory network reconstruction were employed to identify stage-specific gene markers and their upstream regulators. Additionally, we constructed intercellular communication networks to evaluate signaling changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) during LUAD progression. Results: Our analysis revealed that epithelial cells from stage IV tumors exhibited a distinct transcriptional profile compared to earlier stages, a separation not observed in immune or stromal cell populations. We identified a panel of gene markers that differentiated epithelial cells across disease stages and effectively stratified patients into subgroups with distinct survival outcomes and TME compositions. Regulatory network analysis uncovered key transcription factors, including ATF3, ATF4, HSF1, KLF4, and NFIC, as potential upstream regulators of these stage-specific genes. Moreover, cell–cell communication analysis revealed a significant increase in signaling originating from epithelial cells and a concomitant decrease in immune-derived signals in late-stage LUAD. We identified several signaling pathways enriched in stage-specific crosstalk, including Wnt, PTN, and PDGF pathways, which may play critical roles in LUAD progression. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive single-cell resolution map of LUAD progression, highlighting epithelial-driven regulatory programs and dynamic intercellular communication within the TME. Our findings uncover novel molecular markers and regulatory mechanisms with potential prognostic and therapeutic value for more precise treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the predominant cell type in the stroma of many solid organ malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). They exhibit considerable phenotypic and functional heterogeneity and are widely used in functional assays and co-culture models. CAF research frequently involves the in vitro expansion and maintenance of CAFs to facilitate functional assays and co-culture studies. However, less is known about how in vitro culture temporally affects CAF phenotype. Methods We characterised the phenotype of CAFs from NSCLC patients compared to non-cancerous lung fibroblasts using conventional in vitro conditions by tracking changes in CAF subset marker expression levels by flow cytometry. Additional transcriptomic and functional analyses were performed to determine differences between CAFs and non-cancerous fibroblasts. Results We demonstrate that CAFs from NSCLC undergo phenotypic drift in culture, and that there is a convergence to a subset phenotype predominantly upregulated in non-cancerous lung. Additionally, we demonstrate the phenotype, transcriptome and function of fibroblasts converge between CAFs and fibroblasts from non-cancerous lung by the third culture passage, suggesting that in vitro conditions promote this phenotype. Conclusion We highlight the need to understand and monitor the culture phenotype during functional studies with CAFs, as the heterogeneity found in the tumour microenvironment is rapidly lost in cultured cells.">

 Background:
 Variation in response to radiotherapy for the treatment of rectal cancer is likely due to heterogeneity in the tumour microenvironment. However, to date, no reliable predictive biomarkers of response are in clinical use and the mechanisms underlying response are unknown. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), which are ectopic lymphoid aggregates found in the tumour microenvironment, have been linked to response to immunotherapy, but little is known about their role in radiotherapy. Here, we aimed to explore the potential of lymphocytes and tertiary lymphoid structures as predictive biomarkers of response to radiotherapy and profile the tumour immune microenvironment in the context of response to radiotherapy.
 Methods:
 For this study, we accessed pre-treatment biopsies from 20 rectal cancer patients with known pathological response to long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT). We selected regions of interest based on immunohistological identification of tumour and lymphocytic infiltrate in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. We performed targeted proteomic profiling of 87 immuno-oncology proteins using the Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler to quantify protein expression with spatial resolution within regions of interest, including TLSs, in the tumour microenvironment.
 Results:
 Unsupervised clustering based on normalised protein expression showed a clear separation between the complete responders to LCCRT and all other tumours, and this separation is driven by differences in T cells within TLSs (CD3+). Differentially expressed proteins within CD3+ aggregates include depletion of the natural killer cell marker, CD56 and increased expression of the apoptosis marker, cleaved caspase 9. The distribution of TLS-tumour distance was also significantly different between response groups.
 Conclusions:
 The study highlights the role of TLSs in modulating the immunogenic landscape of the tumour microenvironment in rectal cancer, likely influencing the response to radiotherapy. Spatially resolved proteomic analyses identifies potential biomarkers for radiotherapy response and underscores the importance of profiling tumour-immune microenvironment complexity when stratifying patients for therapy.

 Background:
 Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor in adults, with a median survival of ~15 months despite current therapies (surgery, radiation, temozolomide). Advances like immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, and tumor vaccines have shown suboptimal results. The 2021 WHO classification highlights molecular markers (e.g., IDH, MGMT) for better stratification, but these fail to fully capture tumor microenvironmental dynamics. Using an AI-driven transcriptomic approach, we identified novel prognostic subtypes in IDH-wildtype GBM, aiming to refine stratification, enhance understanding of tumor biology, and guide personalized therapeutic strategies.
 Methods:
 We accessed microarray data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n=353 newly diagnosed, IDH-WT GBM) for a training set and RNA-seq data from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) (n=170 primary and n=106 recurrent tumors) for validation. A proprietary SphereBio machine learning–based algorithm was used to derive transcriptomic signatures with prognostic relevance. Subtypes were assessed via Kaplan–Meier analyses in the training cohort and tested in both primary and recurrent validation cohorts. Immune/stromal infiltration was quantified using a tumor deconvolution tool (DA_505), and pathway enrichment (GAGE) was performed on the validation sets.
 Results:
 AI-driven clustering revealed three transcriptomic subtypes with significant survival differences in both the training (p<0.0001) and primary validation (p=0.0004) cohorts. In the recurrent cohort, a similar survival trend by subtype was observed, though significance was diminished (p=0.12), likely due to limited sample size and therapy-related changes. Immune/stromal deconvolution showed distinct infiltration patterns: subtypes enriched for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells correlated with prolonged survival. Pathway enrichment analysis in both primary and recurrent tumors highlighted potential targets involving embryogenesis, immune modulation, cell cycle, and stress response. The persistence of a consistent survival trend and comparable microenvironment and pathway patterns suggest that these transcriptomic subtypes remain biologically relevant even after standard treatment.
 Conclusions:
 Our integrated transcriptomic and microenvironment-focused approach identified three prognostically distinct GBM subtypes, validated across independent cohorts. These findings underscore the utility of AI-driven transcriptomic signatures for personalized stratification, with the potential to guide targeted therapeutic strategies and inform clinical trial design in GBM.

        <tr id="Tumor development is mainly marked by the gradual transformation of cells that acquire capacities such as sustained growth signaling, evasion of growth suppression, resistance to cell death, and induction of angiogenesis, achieving replicative immortality and activating invasion and metastasis. How different epigenetic alterations like m1A, m5C, and m6A contribute to tumor development is a field that still needs to be investigated. The immune modulators, CD70, CD80, and TIGIT, mainly regulate T-cell activation and consequently the immune evasion of tumors. Here, we explored the presence and the potential consequences of RNA modifications in these regulators in pan-cancer. Our findings highlight the critical role of the m6A, m5C, and m1A in regulating CD70, CD80, and TIGIT across multiple solid tumors. By combining epitranscriptomics data with functional enrichment and survival modeling, we show that RNA modification enzymes not only modulate immune-related gene expression but also serve as potential biomarkers for patient prognosis. By constructing a robust four-gene prognostic signature involving YTHDF3, RBM15B, IGF2BP2, and TRMT61A, we demonstrate that RNA modification profiles can accurately stratify patients into risk groups with distinct overall survival outcomes. The performance of this model across eight cancer types underscores the translational promise of epitranscriptomic markers in both mechanistic understanding and personalized oncology. Altogether, our study bridges the gap between the mechanistic regulation of immune checkpoints and their clinical utility, offering novel insights into how the epitranscriptome can be leveraged to improve cancer prognosis and potentially enhance immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objective We aim to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of intervertebral disc (IVD) cell subpopulations in IVD degeneration (IVDD). Methods To gain combined spatial and transcriptomic insights into IVDD, we employed both spatial transcriptomic sequencing (stRNA‐seq) and single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA‐seq) in a rat puncture‐induced IVDD model. The findings were verified in rat and human IVD by immunostaining and qRT‐PCR. Tamoxifen‐administered PdgfraCreERT2;R26tdTomato mice were adopted to track platelet‐derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) positive cells. Results Puncture response regions were revealed on day 1 post‐puncture, for which oxidative stress emerged as a prominent pathway in a Stress Zone consisting of lipocalin‐2 (Lcn2)+ annulus fibrosus (AF) cells (AFC), which propagated and migrated into nucleus pulposus (NP), playing a key role in delivering injury signals and triggering pathological processes, including ferroptosis, fibrosis, and immune reactions. In the NP, Collagen 3‐high (Col3hi) NP cells (NPC) were another induced population demonstrating a fibrochondrocyte‐like phenotype and high epithelial–mesenchymal transition activation, an important pathway involved in tissue fibrosis. Crucially, lineage tracing experiments in PdgfraCreERT2;R26tdTomat mice revealed the significant migration and proliferation of Pdgfra+ AFCs from the AF into the NP following puncture. These findings provide direct evidence that both Pdgfra+ AFCs and Col3hi NP cells may contribute to NP fibrosis. Conclusion Puncture‐induced oxidative stress in a stress zone is the primary reaction playing an important role in initiating IVDD. Several puncture‐induced cell subpopulations were identified, including Lcn2+ AFC, Col3hi NPC, and Pdgfra+ AFC. Lcn2+ AFC plays a pivotal role in connecting oxidative stress with other pathological processes. Our results clarified the dual origin of Pdgfra+ cells, highlighting the contribution of AF‐derived cells to the NP during degeneration and emphasizing the complexity of cellular changes underlying NP fibrosis. Further investigation into the specific contributions of Pdgfra+ cells from different origins to fibrosis is warranted. Key points Puncture induced oxidative stress in a Stress Zone is the primary reaction in initiating IVDD. Puncture induced several IVD cell subpopulations, including Lcn2+ AFC, Col3hi NPC and Pdgfra+ AFC. Lcn2+ AFC plays a pivotal role in connecting oxidative stress with other pathological processes. Pdgfra+ cells in the NP derived from both Pdgfra+ AFC and Col3hi NPC, highlighting dual origin of NP fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Cisplatin is the primary chemotherapeutic agent for osteosarcoma. However, a significant proportion of patients develop resistance post-treatment, leading to disease recurrence and presenting profound clinical challenges. To understand the mechanisms underlying osteosarcoma recurrence and cisplatin resistance, particularly from the tumor microenvironment perspective, we consolidated numerous single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, offering an encompassing insight into the osteosarcoma microenvironment. When juxtaposing scRNA-seq with bulk RNA-seq data, we observed a strong correlation between high DCUN1D5 expression in osteosarcoma and patient survival. This gene amplifies osteosarcoma’s anti-apoptotic, invasive, stem-cell-like traits and PI3K/AKT/GSK3β pathway phosphorylation and fosters cisplatin resistance. Subsequent research revealed that cisplatin-resistant osteosarcoma cells excrete DCUN1D5-rich exosomes, facilitating the maturation of osteoclast precursors. Excessive osteoclast activity is a pivotal contributor to osteosarcoma recurrence and resistance. Given these insights, DCUN1D5 is a promising therapeutic target for osteosarcoma recurrence and drug resistance.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic cancer is a highly malignant tumor of the digestive system with a dismal prognosis. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, overall survival remains extremely low. Early diagnostic markers and an improved understanding of tumor-microenvironment interactions are essential for developing more effective therapies.We analyzed 74 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) samples, performing unsupervised clustering and marker-gene expression profiling to define major cell types. Large-scale chromosomal copy-number variation (CNV) analysis distinguished malignant from non-malignant ductal cells. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) identified stage-associated gene modules, which were integrated with TCGA bulk-RNA data and machine-learning feature selection to pinpoint candidate prognostic genes. Two independent cohorts were used for validation. Regulatory network inference (pySCENIC) and ligand–receptor interaction analysis (CellPhoneDB) explored cross-talk between malignant cells and macrophages. Finally, in vitro knockdown of CTSV assessed its functional role in pancreatic cancer (PAC) cell proliferation and migration.Three prognosis-related genes—ANLN, NT5E, and CTSV—were selected based on their strong association with clinical stage and validated in external datasets. High expression of these genes correlated with poorer overall survival and an increased infiltration of M0 macrophages. CellPhoneDB predicted significant interactions between high-expression malignant ductal cells and M0 macrophages via CXCL14–CXCR4 and IL1RAP–PTPRF axes, with SPI1 identified as an upstream regulator of IL1RAP. In vitro CTSV knockdown significantly inhibited PAC cell proliferation and migration.Our integrative single-cell and bulk-RNA workflow identifies ANLN, NT5E, and CTSV as novel prognostic biomarkers in pancreatic cancer and highlights a pro-tumorigenic interaction between malignant ductal cells and macrophages. Targeting CTSV or disrupting CXCL14–CXCR4 and IL1RAP–PTPRF signaling may offer new therapeutic avenues for PAC.">

        <tr id="Recently, contrary to attacking cancer cells, the tumor microenvironment (TME) with genomic stability and vulnerable nature has emerged as promising therapeutic targets in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Within TME ecosystem, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in tumor evasion and progression of HCC. However, their clinical and therapeutic implications remain unexplored.Utilizing a large-scale sc-RNA seq dataset, a landscape of HCC cellular ecosystem was depicted. Based on previous literature, an effectively differential TAMs subset classification was identified. Gene variations was extracted through trajectory analysis and then unsupervised clustering was conducted within RNA-seq data. Subsequently, survival analysis, specific pathway enrichment as well as hub regulatory network analysis were performed. Additionally, the immune cell infiltration and genomic variations were evaluated between clusters. Drug sensitivity and underlying therapeutic molecular were also explored. Through multiple immunofluorescence, our findings were verified.Herein, integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq data, we established a novel TAM classification system based on mutually exclusive SPP1 and FOLR2 signatures. According to the TAM trajectory genes, unsupervised clustering stratified HCC into three distinct clusters. Cluster 3 (C3), which is characterized by metabolic dysregulation and immunosuppressive TME, exhibited the poorest prognosis among the three groups. Hub network analysis of C3 further indicated its characteristic dysregulation of liver-specific metabolism. SPP1 was identified as a key signature of C3, which contributed to suppressing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Therapeutic evaluation revealed that C3 were sensitive to chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, while those C1 and C2 were more suitable for immunotherapy. Drug screening identified potential therapeutic compounds for each cluster.This study redefines the heterogeneity of TAMs beyond the M1/M2 paradigm, linking the TAMs trajectory genes to HCC patient stratification. SPP1 blockade emerged as a strategy for counteracting immunosuppression, and cluster-specific therapies may optimize the management of HCC.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presents significant clinical challenges owing to its dense stroma and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, large-scale single-cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics (ST) were integrated to dissect the heterogeneity of fibroblasts and their crosstalk with epithelial cells, with a focus on key ligand-receptor interactions. Eight distinct fibroblast subpopulations were identified, among which extracellular matrix (ECM)-remodeling fibroblasts were particularly enriched in tumor tissues and associated with poor prognosis. ECM-remodeling fibroblasts were located at the terminal stage of the fibroblast pseudotime trajectory, and SOX11 was identified as a key transcription factor in this subpopulation. Further analyses revealed that ECM-remodeling fibroblasts can interact with epithelial cells through the POSTN-ITGAV/ITGB5 ligand-receptor axis, a critical pathway that promotes tumor progression. Clinical analyses demonstrated a strong correlation between POSTN expression and poor prognosis in patients with PDAC. Mechanistically, POSTN interacts with integrin ITGAV/ITGB5 on tumor cells, activating the PI3K/AKT/β-catenin pathway and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Pharmacological inhibition of the POSTN-integrin axis partially reversed these malignant traits, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. This study provides new insights into fibroblast heterogeneity and its role in PDAC progression, emphasizing the POSTN-ITGAV/ITGB5 axis as a promising target for therapeutic interventions.">

Here we analyze 11 ETMR samples from patients using single-cell transcriptomics and multiplexed spatial imaging. We reveal a spatially distinct cellular hierarchy that spans highly proliferative neural stem-like cells and more differentiated neuron-like cells. C19MC is predominantly expressed in stem-like cells and controls a transcriptional network governing stemness and lineage commitment, as resolved by genome-wide analysis of microRNA-mRNA binding. Systematic analysis of receptor–ligand interactions between malignant cell types reveals fibroblast growth factor receptor and Notch signaling as oncogenic pathways that can be successfully targeted in preclinical models and in one patient with ETMR.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a high-mortality cancer characterized by its aggressive, treatment-resistant phenotype and a complex tumour microenvironment (TME) featuring significant hypoxia. Bulk transcriptomic analysis has identified the “classical” and “basal-like” transcriptional subtypes which have prognostic value; however, it is not well-established how microenvironmental heterogeneity contributes to these transcriptional signatures. Here, we exploited the TRACER platform to perform single cell transcriptome analysis of organoids at specific spatial locations to explore the effect of oxygen and other cell-generated microenvironmental gradients on organoid heterogeneity. We found that the microenvironmental gradients present in TRACER significantly impact the distribution of organoid transcriptional phenotypes and the enrichment of gene sets linked to cancer progression and treatment resistance. More significantly, we found that microenvironmental gradients, predominantly oxygen, drive changes in the expression of classical and basal-like transcriptional subtype gene signatures. This work suggests that hypoxia contributes to determining transcriptional subtypes in PDAC tumour cells independent of additional cells in the TME and broadly highlights the importance of considering microenvironmental gradients such as oxygen in organoid-based studies.

        <tr id="Type I collagen (Collagen I, Col I), a principal component of the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) that accounts for 80% of total ECM collagen, has emerged as a crucial factor in tumor biology. Recent research has found that Col I has influenced tumor growth, invasion, migration, and prognosis by forming a physical barrier and interacting with components in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a prominent stromal microenvironment with remarkable cellular and spatial heterogeneity, which significantly impacts the biology of the disease and its resistance to treatment. As research on the influence of ECM on tumor behavior progresses, the role of Col I in tumor occurrence and development has also been gradually expounded. Unlike the pro-tumorigenic role caused by excessive deposition in other cancers, PDAC features a dense stroma with spatial heterogeneity, where Col I deposition exhibits paradoxical pro- and anti-tumor effects: Cancer-associated fibroblasts secrete heterotrimeric Col I (α1/α1/α2), which initially suppresses tumor growth by recruiting M1 macrophages, while tumor cells produce homotrimeric Col I (α1/α1/α1, 2–3% of total Col I) to promote immune evasion via CXCL5 secretion and CD8+ T cell reduction. Mechanistically, Col I activates TGF-β/SMAD3 signaling to drive epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhances matrix stiffness, increasing tumor cell migration by 60–80% in 3D cell culture models. Thus, understanding the complex interactions between Col I and other microenvironmental components may enhance its anti-tumor action while suppressing its pro-tumor activity, potentially improving PDAC patients’ survival. In this review, we discuss the current research progress regarding the function of Col I in PDAC tumors and summarize its contributions to PDAC progression, thus providing a basis for follow-up research and potential targets for cancer treatment.">

 Background:
 The tumor microenvironment (TME) that surrounds pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a multi-faceted and dynamic ecosystem in which stromal fibroblasts communicate with cancer cells to mediate tumor growth, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance. It is well recognized that both cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and its non-cellular, fibrotic components within the TME can foster a protumorigenic environment for PDAC. However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the precise mechanisms in which this dense, fibrotic matrix can help drive malignant behaviors. Here, we reveal a novel mechanism in which the zinc-finger transcription factor GLI2 regulates type 1 collagen expression within CAFs and how the soluble variant of this collagen promotes irinotecan chemoresistance.
 Methods:
 We leveraged transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, International Cancer Genome Consortium, and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium to evaluate GLI2 expression and stromal content of human PDAC tumors through bulk RNA-sequencing deconvolution. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing of human PDAC tumors, we validated the association of GLI2 expression and stromal matrix constituents in CAFs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in human CAFs confirmed GLI2 binding at the COL1A1 promoter. Through RNAi-based inactivation of GLI2, we determined how loss of GLI2 impacts regulation of type 1 collagen. Additionally, we conducted MTT assays to assess tumor viability in response to irinotecan treatment.
 Results:
 Transcriptomic analysis revealed that GLI2 is highly enriched in CAFs and strongly correlated with stromal fibrosis compared to other non-tumor cell constituents within the TME. We have shown that GLI2 directly binds to the promoter of COL1A1, a key component of type 1 collagen, in CAFs and regulates its transcription in a manner dependent on TGFβ1 signaling. Interestingly, PDAC tumors exposed to type 1 collagen show increased expression of pro-tumorigenic pathways involved in inflammation, EGR signaling, cytokine-receptor interactions, and irinotecan resistance. We further validate that human PDAC cells pre-treated with collagen can confer chemoresistance to irinotecan with viability assays.
 Conclusions:
 Taken together, our study demonstrates a novel mechanism in which GLI2 regulates the secretion of collagen within CAFs, which in turn can enable PDAC to acquire resistance to standard-of-care treatments. These findings highlight not only the oncogenic functions for CAFs and their fibrotic secretome, but also open new avenues in which therapeutic targeting of the TME may provide clinical benefit for PDAC patients.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly invasive and heterogeneous malignancy, posing challenges for reproducible modeling and functional phenotypic analysis. To address these limitations, we developed a standardized 3D patternoid platform using collagen-based microcavity arrays to enhance organoid formation consistency and quantify subtype-specific invasion mechanisms. We utilized murine primary PDAC cells stratified by epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) into three subtypes: epithelial (E-9591), hybrid EMT (Mlow-8028), and mesenchymal (M-16992). The platform's sensitivity was verified by a strong correlation between EMT scores and invasive phenotypes, as well as responses to physiological concentrations of the protease inhibitor batimastat. Key invasion parameters—including invasive area, maximum invasion distance, and branching complexity—were measured under both genomic and drug-induced conditions. The platform demonstrated high inter-organoid reproducibility, with precise control over initial cell numbers ensuring batch-to-batch comparability. Invasion dynamics analysis revealed that epithelial cells (E-9591) primarily relied on spatial constraints within the microcavity to invade. Batimastat drug sensitivity assays further distinguished invasion dependencies of the mesenchymal subtypes, confirming that M-16992 patternoids exhibit a stronger sensitivity towards MMP inhibition compared to Mlow-8028 patternoids. Concurrentlty, both subtypes experienced a shift towards epithelial-like spatial constraint triggered invasion morphology, reflecting the plasticity of PDAC invasiveness. This scalable and adaptable 3D patternoid platform enables high-throughput analysis of invasive behaviors and therapeutic responses, offering significant potential for preclinical cancer research and personalized medicine.">

        <tr id="In vitro hematopoiesis systems can be used to define mechanisms for blood cell formation and function, produce cell therapeutics, and model blood cell contributions to systemic disease. Hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) production remains inefficient, precluded by knowledge gaps related to specification and morphogenesis of specialized hemogenic endothelial cells, which undergo an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) to form HPCs. We elected to define changes in gene expression and chromatin organization during HPC formation to reveal regulatory mechanisms. Using paired single cell RNA/ATAC sequencing together with Hi-C, we profiled cells before and after EHT. Pathway analysis and pseudotime inferences confirmed a continuum of stromal and endothelial cells undergoing development into HE cells and lineage-based HPCs in vitro. In these cell types, we characterize cis-regulatory elements and transcriptional regulatory activities that facilitate EHT and HPC homeostasis, including for SNAI1, SOX17, TGFβ, STAT4, as well as for GFI1b and KLF1 in megakaryocyte- and erythroid-biased progenitors, respectively. We then leveraged our insights into chromatin organization among in vitro-derived cells to assess enrichments corresponding to human trait variation reported in human genome wide association studies. HPCs revealed locus enrichment for quantitative blood traits and autoimmune disease predisposition, which were particularly enriched in myeloid- and lymphoid-biased populations. Stromal and endothelial cells from our in vitro cultures were specifically enriched for accessible chromatin at blood pressure loci. Our findings reveal genes and mechanisms governing in vitro hematopoietic development and blood cell-related disease pathology.">

        <tr id="Introduction Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a highly aggressive form of cancer with poor prognosis, characterized by significant molecular and immune heterogeneity. The activation of KRAS signaling pathways is implicated in melanoma progression, yet its role in shaping the tumor microenvironment, particularly in macrophage infiltration, remains poorly understood. Methods A comprehensive multi-platform approach was employed, analyzing gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was utilized to characterize the molecular pathways associated with KRAS signaling. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was leveraged to investigate the cellular heterogeneity within the SKCM tumor microenvironment, and macrophage populations were categorized using the Monocle2 algorithm. A KRAS-Macrophage Prognostic Associated Gene (KMPAG) signature was developed by integrating these findings, followed by validation using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. The prognostic value of the KMPAG signature was assessed through its correlation with clinical outcomes, immune cell infiltration patterns, response to therapy, drug sensitivity, and miRNA-gene regulatory interactions. Cell-cell communication within the SKCM microenvironment was explored using the “CellChat” tool. Experimental validation of gene expression was performed via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and functional assays in gene-modified melanoma cell lines. Results Twenty-two genes involved in KRAS signaling were identified as critical for patient survival. Single-cell analysis revealed nine distinct cell populations within the SKCM microenvironment, leading to the construction of the KMPAG risk model, which incorporated three key genes—CLEC4A, CXCL10, and LAT2. This signature effectively reclassified macrophage subsets, offering improved diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. Furthermore, the KMPAG signature correlated with a range of clinical parameters, including immune infiltration levels, tumor stage, and therapy response. The model also provided insights into the immune landscape of SKCM, facilitating the prediction of responses to immunotherapy. Functional assays demonstrated that downregulation of CLEC4A significantly promoted melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of KRAS signaling and macrophage infiltration in melanoma prognosis. The KMPAG gene signature presents a novel prognostic tool, offering insights into personalized treatment strategies and predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy in SKCM. Further exploration of CLEC4A’s role in melanoma progression may provide new therapeutic avenues for targeted intervention.">

        <tr id="Background Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a rare and aggressive pediatric bone malignancy with poor prognosis, driven by therapy-resistant tumor microenvironments (TME). The TME plays a critical role in tumor progression through a complex and dynamic network of reciprocal interactions among immune cells (dysfunctional T cells, immunosuppressive macrophages), stromal components (cancer-associated fibroblasts), and tumor cells. These interactions collectively shape the immune landscape, promote immune evasion, and contribute to therapeutic resistance. Identifying reliable prognostic markers remains a critical challenge. Methods Here we performed an integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, WGCNA, and bulk RNA-seq analyses to investigate tumor-immune interactions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) intersected with T cell markers identified a total of 174 T cell-associated genes. Functional enrichment analysis and molecular subtyping were performed to explore immune-related pathways. A prognostic model based on CLEC11A, BDP1, and ID3 was constructed using Cox regression and validated in external datasets. Immune infiltration was assessed using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Results T cell marker analyses revealed key roles in pathways such as PI3K-Akt signaling and immune modulation. Molecular subtyping identified two clusters with distinct immune microenvironments: Cluster C1 (immunosuppressive phenotype and poorer prognosis) and Cluster C2 (functionally active immune profile associated with better prognosis). The prognostic model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival (AUC: 0.85, 0.82, 0.78). Additionally, a higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) with low survival rate has been observed in High-risk group. Immune infiltration analysis showed higher CD8+ T cell and dendritic cell activity and immune checkpoint expression in low-risk groups. Experimental validation demonstrated that ID3 silencing inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in ES cell lines. Conclusion Together, our study identified CLEC11A, BDP1, and ID3 as key T cell associated prognostic markers and developed a validated model to predict survival outcomes in ES. Insights into T cell markers and tumor-immune dynamics offer promising advances in prognostic assessment and immunotherapy for ES. Furthermore, the role of ID3 in immune evasion and tumor proliferation underscores its potential as a therapeutic target, providing new avenues for immune checkpoint regulation and personalized treatment strategies.">

Cell-cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) can promote tumor growth, yet their therapeutic value has not been fully explored. Here, bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics (ST) were integrated to analyze the heterogeneity of GC microenvironment. Tumor-specific GREM1+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages were significantly enriched in GC tissues and were involved in immunosuppression, inflammation regulation, and tumor progression. We then indicated that GREM1+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages were positively correlated in 12 independent GC datasets and validated their close localization by multiplex immunohistochemistry staining and spatial transcriptomics. Patients with both high GREM1+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages exhibited significantly shorter OS and showed enrichment of tumor-associated pathways. Our results demonstrated the complex interactions between GREM1+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages, which may serve as a potential therapeutic target for future treatment of GC.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer is the most prevalent form of malignant tumor that frequently metastasizes to axillary lymph nodes (LNs). Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms underlying alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in LN metastasis in breast cancer remain poorly understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing of 28 LN samples from 23 patients is performed, and a comprehensive landscape of the entire ecosystem is generated. Ten major cell types are identified, with the subclusters of each major cell type exhibiting diverse characteristics. Furthermore, multiple signatures are collected to evaluate the key components of the subclusters using multi-omics methodologies. This study finds that myCAFs may hasten LN metastasis, and observed a notable increase in APOE+ macrophages and a higher proportion of exhausted CD8+ T cells, contributing to the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, cancer cells in metastatic lesions exhibited diverse expression patterns linked to proliferation, metastasis, oxidative phosphorylation, hypoxia, and interferon responses. Using multi-omics approaches and experimental validations, it determines that GLO1 can promote lymphatic angiogenesis, metastasis, and inhibit the proteasomal degradation of GSS, thereby maintaining intracellular glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance. Collectively, the study offers novel perspectives on the microenvironment remodeling of breast cancer LN metastases, suggesting that GLO1 may be a promising therapeutic target.">

 Background:
 Histone lactylation, a newly identified epigenetic modification, has been extensively implicated in the initiation and progression of tumors. However, the precise role of histone lactylation in modulating tumor cell responses to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity remains insufficiently explored.
 Methods:
 To elucidate the adaptive changes tumor cells undergo in response to T cell-induced cytotoxicity within the tumor microenvironment (TME), we performed a comprehensive, genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen. This approach facilitated the identification of genetic alterations in lung cancer cells co-cultured with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that promote their evasion of T cell-mediated destruction. Complementary RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells modulate their response to T cell-mediated killing, particularly following the deletion of the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1).
 Results:
 MCT1 deletion significantly heightened the cancer-cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing. Furthermore, the loss of MCT1 led to mitochondrial dysfunction within the tumor cells. Mechanistically, MCT1 knockout resulted in a reduction of histone H3K18 lactylation and downregulation of ferridoxin reductase (FDXR), which disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis and precipitated mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, the combination of MCT1 inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy substantially enhanced ICB efficacy, prolonged survival in both lung cancer and malignant pleural effusion (MPE) murine models, and alleviated the immunosuppressive milieu within the TME.
 Conclusions:
 Our findings reveal a novel role for lactate metabolism in modulating mitochondrial dysfunction and anti-tumor immunity, with lactylation-mediated regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis serving as a critical mechanism. These results provide new insights into the epigenetic regulation of tumorigenesis and highlight potential immune-metabolic strategies for targeted lactate metabolism therapies in the treatment of lung cancer and MPE.

The poor prognosis and lack of early diagnostic methods remain major challenges in the treatment of this cancer. In this article, in order to better detect the occurrence of pancreatic cancer, tools such as monocle3, singleR, harmony in R, and scanpy in Python were used to analyze the cells and genes of pancreatic cancer tissues in mice. By analyzing the data, the following results were obtained: T-cells in healthy PBMCs exhibited broader spatial dispersion than in PDAC tissues, suggesting tumor-driven immune surveillance impairment, while PDAC-associated macrophages displayed expanded distribution linked to pro-tumorigenic functions such as COL1A1-mediated ECM remodeling; Pseudotemporal trajectory analysis revealed myeloid progenitor bifurcation into monocytes/macrophages, with PDAC macrophages showing epigenetically silenced cytotoxic pathways such as suppressed GZMA/NKG7 and enhanced ribosomal biogenesis; Tissue-specific markers such as LCN2 in healthy and CTRB1/AMY2A in PDAC) and spatial co-localization of macrophages/tumor cells highlighted NOP53 as a dual-function hubinhibiting PI3K-AKT while activating p53and SPP1 as a paradoxical regulator of metastasis and antitumor immunity; Differential expression and GO enrichment analyses identified ribosomal biogenesis and cytoplasmic translation as PDAC-enriched pathways, contrasting with suppressed stress responses. Our spatial transcriptomic profiling further resolved elevated NOP53, CFB, and SPP1 expression gradients in PDAC tissues, proposing these as diagnostic biomarkers.">

        <tr id="Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite advancements in treatment, prognosis for patients with advanced stages remains poor. Metabolic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment, particularly abnormal glycolysis, plays a crucial role in immune evasion and treatment response. We collected nine single-cell datasets to create a single-cell atlas of CD8 + T cells from 89 NSCLC patients, revealing ten distinct states of these cells. We employed a multimodal data analysis approach, integrating bulk transcriptomics, single-cell transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and proteomics. Using 117 machine learning models, we identified key genes associated with NSCLC metastasis. Notably, the StepCox[forward] + Lasso model was instrumental in pinpointing key genes that significantly impact disease prognosis. Our analysis revealed that LTB + LDHA + CD8 + T cells have a distinct metabolic and immune phenotype, characterized by enhanced glycolysis and elevated lactate production. This not only facilitates tumor cell migration and invasion but also impairs the cytotoxic function of CD8 + T cells. Furthermore, our machine learning models identified four key genes significantly associated with NSCLC metastasis: TBCD, PTPRC, LDHA, and ACTR2. Of these, high LDHA expression was strongly linked to poorer responses to immunotherapy and a higher risk of therapy resistance. LTB + LDHA + CD8 + T cells also reduced antitumor immune responses by inhibiting the secretion of effector molecules like GNLY. Additionally, elevated LDHA expression was associated with reduced CD8 + T cell infiltration, which further promotes tumor immune evasion. This study highlights the heterogeneity of CD8 + T cells in NSCLC, emphasizing the unique role of the LTB + CD8 + Tn subpopulation in metastasis. LDHA is identified as a critical key gene with a significant impact on immunotherapy outcomes, presenting a potential therapeutic target. These insights offer new biomarkers and targeted strategies for personalized immune therapy.">

        <tr id="Background Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have gained increasing attention for their role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), particularly in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which may play a key role in tumor microenvironment remodeling and cancer progression. This study aims to identify CAF signature genes associated with EMT through the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk transcriptomic data, and to construct a prognostic model for LUAD to further understand the molecular mechanisms of CAFs in LUAD and their clinical significance. Methods We integrated RNA sequencing data and clinical information of LUAD patients from the TCGA and GEO databases, along with single-cell RNA sequencing data for cell subtype identification and EMT activity analysis. The Seurat package was used for quality control, clustering, and EMT pathway activity quantification. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to identify EMT-CAF-related genes, and univariate Cox regression and LASSO regression were applied to construct a risk score model. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and ROC curve analysis were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the model, along with further assessments of the tumor microenvironment, immune infiltration features, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and drug sensitivity. Results Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identified eight major cell populations, with CAFs showing significant EMT activation. Differential expression analysis identified 84 EMT-CAF-related genes, from which eight key genes were selected to construct a risk score model. High-risk patients showed significantly worse survival outcomes compared to low-risk patients. Tumor microenvironment analysis indicated that the high-risk group had lower immune and stromal scores, with higher tumor purity. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed a lower proportion of anti-tumor immune cells (such as activated B cells and CD8 + T cells) in the tumor tissue of the high-risk group, with a higher proportion of immune-suppressive cells. TMB analysis demonstrated significantly higher tumor mutational burden in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group. Additionally, drug sensitivity analysis indicated that the high-risk group exhibited greater sensitivity to common anti-lung cancer drugs. Conclusions This study integrates single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data to uncover the potential role of EMT-CAF-related genes in LUAD and constructs a prognostic risk score model with significant clinical value. The model effectively predicts patient survival risk and provides new insights for risk stratification and personalized treatment. Moreover, we observed that high-risk patients have higher tumor mutational burden and immune suppression characteristics, suggesting that these features may influence disease progression. Further studies are needed to validate the clinical applicability and biological mechanisms of these findings.

 Background:
 T cell-based immunotherapies have demonstrated great success for the treatment of many solid tumors, but not all tumor types and patients respond well or durably. Reasons for these discrepancies are unclear. High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is an example of a deadly disease that has exhibited poor responses to T cell targeted therapies, like checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, it would be an ideal model for studying other parts of the immune ecosystem that could contribute to anti-tumor immunity. Tumor infiltrating B cells (TIL-Bs) are being increasingly studied in HGSOC because of their association with improved prognosis, especially when differentiated into germinal center (GC) B cells. However, the true effector functions of B cells, including antigen presentation, cytokine production, and antibody production, in ovarian and other solid tumors remains understudied. Here, we study tumor antigen-specific B cell responses in a mouse model of HGSOC.
 Methods:
 We have engineered a murine HGSOC cell line ID8 p53 -/- brca2 -/- (ID8) to express a membrane bound mode antigen, hen egg lysozyme (mHEL), at two different affinities to primary HEL-specific B cells (MD4 B cells) from MD4 transgenic mice. We use flow cytometry to characterize HEL-specific B cell responses to ID8 mHEL-expressing cells
 in vitro
 . We use a syngeneic mouse model of HGSOC in which we intraperitoneally inject ID8 cells (with or without mHEL) and use flow cytometry to identify immune phenotypes of B and T cells in tumor tissue, spleen, lymph nodes, and ascites. We also use ELISA to measure HEL-specific antibody production in the ascites and serum of these mice.
 Results:
 We demonstrate that MD4 B cells can upregulate canonical B cell receptor signaling elements in response to stimulation with ID8 mHEL
 in vitro
 , and that these responses can be titrated based upon the affinity of the mHEL presented. We also show that the syngeneic ID8 p53 -/- brca2 -/- mouse model produces tumors in the ovaries and peritoneum that are enriched for B cells, and that the ascites is specifically enriched for antigen specific B2 B cells (with a much smaller innate like B1 compartment as compared to the peritoneal lavage of non-tumor controls). We plan to inject host mice with ID8 mHEL tumors and compare tumor progression in mice that subsequently receive intraperitoneal adoptive transfer of MD4 HEL-specific B cells versus not. We also plan to compare the phenotypes of B and T cells in the tumor, spleen, lymph nodes, and ascites of these mice, as well as the serum and ascites levels of HEL antibodies.
 Conclusions:
 We have generated a model antigen expressing ovarian cancer cell line that produces antigen-specific B cell responses
 in vitro
 , and have shown that there is an enrichment in antigen-specific B cells in these ovarian tumors and ascites; future
 in vivo
 studies will elucidate the important effector functions of TIL-Bs in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors.

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 is crucial in treating breast cancer. Despite clinical success, the mechanisms by which ICB therapies reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME) and enhance anti-tumor activity remain unclear. Recent studies reveal that anti-PD-1 therapies broadly alter TME cells beyond PD-1+ T cells, highlighting extensive cell-cell communication (CCC) as a key factor. Understanding CCC changes in response to anti-PD-1 therapy can illuminate its mechanisms of action (MOA) and TME dynamics. This study applies causal inference methodology to investigate CCC between T cells and non-T cells in the TME of breast cancer patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy.
 Methods:
 We analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data from 31 breast cancer patients pre- and on-treatment with anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab) reported by Bassez et al., 2021. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across cell types. We applied the instrumental variable method to identify causal relationships between signals in T-cell and non-T-cell DEGs to uncover treatment-induced CCC. We further searched for ligand-receptor pairs mediating CCC and identified gene expression modules (GEMs) regulated by these ligand-receptors. Finally, we constructed a CCC network from T to non-T cells.
 Results:
 Anti-PD1 treatment induced broad gene expression changes in diverse cell populations. Major T cell pathways influenced by anti-PD-1 therapy include NF-κB, interferon-γ and interleukins. CD4
 +
 and CD8
 +
 exhausted cells, expressing high levels of
 PDCD1
 (encoding PD-1), exhibited distinct activated pathways. We identified the CCC network from T cells to non-T cells via ligand-receptor interactions. For example, anti-PD1 treatment activated cellular stress, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways in T cells, altering the expression of a GEM that included
 TSC22D3
 and
 TXNIP
 . This initiated signaling to myeloid cells via
 RPS19
 -
 C5AR1
 , leading to NF-κB activation. CD4+ exhausted T cells primarily signaled to monocytes, enhancing helper functions to recruit and activate monocytes, thereby promoting immune regulation and amplification. In contrast, CD8+ exhausted T cells primarily interacted with macrophages, intensifying cytotoxic responses that facilitated effective tumor-cell killing.
 Conclusions:
 Our analyses provide insights into the dynamic interplay of cells within the TMEs during anti-PD-1 therapy. These findings could facilitate the identification of new biomarkers for predicting heterogeneous treatment responses to anti-PD-1 regimens, potentially enhancing the design and customization of immunotherapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients. Finally, this study demonstrated the utility of causal inference methodologies for mechanistic studies of CCC.

Exploring the molecular characteristics of epithelial cells (EPCs) as high-stage intraepithelial neoplasia evolves into CC is essential for the development of effective targeted drugs for cervical cancer. Single-cell RNA sequencing technology can fully understand the immune response at each molecular level, providing new ideas and directions for the precise treatment of CC. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to comprehensively map EPCs characteristics. The differentiation trajectory of EPCs was inferred using Slingshot, while enrichment analysis highlighted the biological functions of EPCs. Cellchat visualized cell-cell interactions, and SCENIC was used to infer transcription factor regulatory networks in EPCs. CCK-8, colony formation, and EDU experiments were used to verify cell proliferation changes. Scratch assays and transwell assays were used to verify cell migration and invasion. Results A distinct EPCs subpopulation with high TOP2A expression was identified, predominantly originating from tumor tissues. This subpopulation exhibited disrupted mitosis and cell cycle regulation, along with features of high proliferation, high energy metabolism, and matrix plasticity. It played a key role in shaping the tumor microenvironment via the LAMC1-(ITGA3-ITGB1) signaling pathway. FOXM1, a key transcription factor in this cell subpopulation, significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Atherosclerosis involves complex interactions between lipids, immune cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts within the arterial wall. While significant advances in single-cell technologies have shed light on the roles of immune cells and vascular smooth muscle cells in plaque development, fibroblasts remain underexplored, leaving critical gaps in understanding their contributions to disease progression and plaque stability. Comprehensive characterization of fibroblast phenotypes in atherosclerosis is essential to unravel their diverse functions and to distinguish between subsets that may play protective versus pathogenic roles in the disease process.


METHODS
Here, we utilized cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing to comprehensively profile fibroblast diversity in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. Mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 0, 8, 19, and 26 weeks, representing distinct stages of disease progression, enabling a detailed phenotypic characterization of fibroblasts throughout the course of atherosclerosis development.


RESULTS
We identified 4 distinct fibroblast subpopulations, including a myofibroblast population closely resembling vascular smooth muscle cell-derived chondromyocytes. The proportions of these fibroblast subsets exhibited a modest decline as atherosclerosis progressed. Through multimodal analysis, we identified CD26 as a highly expressed and specific marker for one of these fibroblast subpopulations, distinguishing it from other subsets. Using a combination of flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that CD26+ fibroblasts predominantly reside in the adventitia of healthy arteries. During atherosclerosis progression, these cells expand into the intima and primarily localize within the fibrous cap of the lesion.


CONCLUSIONS
Our multiomic analysis highlights the phenotypic diversity and dynamic changes of fibroblasts during atherosclerosis progression. Among these, CD26+ fibroblasts emerge as a distinct subpopulation that expands within atherosclerotic lesions and may play a critical role in promoting plaque stability through their migration into the fibrous cap.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is known for its stepwise progression from healthy skin to premalignant actinic keratosis (AK), followed by a malignant transformation to SCC. Unfortunately, less attention has been paid to changes in gene expression in the tumour microenvironment during this process. We retrospectively selected early‐stage cutaneous SCC tissue samples containing both invasive and premalignant portions and conducted a spatial transcriptomic experiment using a NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP). First, we selected invasive and premalignant regions of interest (ROIs) for each tissue. We then compared the gene expression patterns between the two portions (invasive versus premalignant) of the three segments: tumour cells, immune cells and fibroblasts, in each ROI. As a result, early‐stage cutaneous SCC tissue samples from 17 patients were selected for this study. We identified 29, 14 and 15 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the invasive and premalignant portions of the tumour cells, immune cells and fibroblasts, respectively. The top three genes with the highest absolute log2 fold‐change were CCDC88C, GJD3 and COMP in tumour cells; SVEP1, TSLP and PPP2R5C in immune cells; and SPAG6, PPP1CA and CCDC68 in fibroblasts. Notably, several genes, such as COMP, SVEP1 and SPAG6, have been linked to the development and function of cancer‐associated fibroblasts. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that several pathways were altered in tumour and immune cells. In conclusion, distinctive changes in gene expression patterns were observed as AK progressed to SCC.">

        <tr id="Background Cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC) pose significant global health challenges. While the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is known to influence cancer biology, its specific role in CESC remains unclear. Methods We employed machine learning to analyze UPRmt genes in CESC using TCGA multi-omics data. Our comprehensive analysis included genetic alterations, prognostic significance, tumor-immune interactions, single-cell transcriptomics, pathway enrichment, and drug sensitivity assessments. Results ATF5 emerged as the most significant prognostic factor among UPRmt genes, with high expression correlating with better overall survival. High ATF5 expression was associated with an immunologically active tumor microenvironment, characterized by enhanced immune cell infiltration, increased immune checkpoint expression, and higher tumor mutational burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed ATF5’s distinct expression patterns in stromal cells, particularly in endometrial stromal and smooth muscle cells. Gene set enrichment analysis provided mechanistic insight, revealing ATF5’s connection to the immune response via the regulation of P-stalk ribosome functions, a finding that underscores a novel aspect of UPRmt’s role in shaping the tumor immune landscape. Drug sensitivity analysis showed that low ATF5 expression correlated with resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, paclitaxel, and etoposide) but increased sensitivity to imatinib, potentially through EP300-dependent mechanisms. Conclusions Our findings establish ATF5 as both a favorable prognostic marker and a key immune response regulator in CESC. Its influence on the tumor microenvironment and treatment response suggests potential therapeutic applications. These insights into UPRmt’s role in CESC provide new directions for developing personalized treatment strategies.

        <tr id="Background Ovarian cancer is one of the most common malignancies of the female reproductive system and is associated with poor prognosis. This study aimed to utilize single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the heterogeneity of malignant epithelial cells in ovarian cancer, focusing on their potential functions and the implications for treatment and prognosis. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing data were clustered using a single-cell transcriptome clustering method, and malignant epithelial cells were identified through copy number variation analysis. The interaction patterns between different malignant subpopulations and immune/stromal cells were analyzed using cell-to-cell communication analysis. A risk score (URS) model based on the UBE2C + epithelial subpopulation was then constructed through LASSO and multivariable Cox regression. High and low URS groups were compared in terms of tumor mutational burden (TMB), survival outcomes, and drug sensitivity. Finally, the role of GTF2F2 in ovarian cancer progression was validated through gene knockdown experiments in an ovarian cancer cell line (ES-2). Results Three major malignant epithelial cell subpopulations were identified (TMSB4X + Epi, TSC22D1 + Epi, and UBE2C + Epi). The UBE2C + Epi subpopulation exhibited higher stemness and greater invasive potential. The constructed URS model effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group displaying a higher TMB level (p = 0.00011). Drug sensitivity predictions indicated that osimertinib, rapamycin, and dihydrorotenone might have stronger inhibitory effects in the high-risk group, whereas ERK inhibitors were more effective in the low-risk group. Functional assays demonstrated that GTF2F2 knockdown significantly suppressed ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion. Western blot analyses further showed elevated E-cadherin and reduced N-cadherin expression, suggesting that GTF2F2 may promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Conclusion The risk score model established in this study offers a novel framework for patient stratification and personalized therapy. Notably, the identification of the UBE2C + Epi subpopulation and key genes such as GTF2F2 highlights potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets, shedding light on the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer and paving the way for precision medicine approaches.

At the onset of tumor growth, a dynamic and reciprocal relationship is developed between cancer cells and components of the tumor microenvironment; this relationship supports cancer cell survival, local invasion, and metastatic dissemination.

 Background:
 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly lethal malignancy, and there is an urgent need for more effective therapies. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which combine the precision of monoclonal antibodies with the cytotoxic power of small molecules, represent a promising approach. Despite extensive research, the relationship between ADC target overexpression and the transcriptional profile of SCLC remains unclear. Our study aimed to elucidate how ADC target expression correlates with transcriptional subtypes of SCLC, potentially guiding the selection of ADCs based on molecular profiling.
 Methods:
 RNA-seq and tandem mass spectrometry data for 107 patients with matched SCLC tumors and normal adjacent lung tissue were obtained from the CPTAC SCLC cohort. SCLC subtypes were defined according to expression of four transcription factors: achaete-scute homologue 1 (ASCL1), neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (NeuroD1), yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and POU class 2 homeobox 3 (POU2F3). ADC target expression for DLL3, SEZ6, B7-H3 (
 CD276
 ), and Trop2 (
 TACSTD2
 ) were assessed at the transcriptomic and proteomic level. The correlation between transcriptional subtype and ADC target expression was determined using Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
 Results:
 In 107 SCLC tumors, subtypes corresponded to 66 (61.6%) ASCL1, 21 (19.6%) NeuroD1, 3 (2.8%) YAP1, and 17 (15.9%) POU2F3. The ASCL1 subtype was positively correlated with DLL3 (R
 2
 =0.93, p=9E-87) and SEZ6 (R
 2
 =0.85, p=2.9E-57), and negatively correlated with TROP2 expression (R
 2
 =-0.72, p=1.5E-34). The NEUROD1 subtype showed moderate positive correlation with DLL3 (R
 2
 =0.52, p=4.8E-14) and SEZ6 (R
 2
 =0.58, p=3.6E-18), and a moderate negative correlation with TROP2 (R
 2
 =-0.52, p=1.6E-14). The POU2F3 subtype did not demonstrate strong positive or negative correlations with ADC targets. The YAP1 subtype was negatively correlated DLL3 (R
 2
 =-0.72, p=1.1E-32) and SEZ6 (R
 2
 =-0.71, p=9.5E-33), and positively correlated with Trop2 expression (R
 2
 =0.85, P=7.5E-61).
 Conclusions:
 Our findings reveal that molecular subtypes of SCLC exhibit unique patterns of ADC target expression. These profiles are crucial for further research and could lead to the development of subtype-specific treatments that improve clinical outcomes for patients with SCLC.

        <tr id="Reactivation of transposable elements (TEs) in somatic tissues, particularly of LINE-1, is associated with disease by causing gene mutations and DNA damage. Previous work has shown that the PIWI pathway is crucial for TE suppression in the germline. However, the status and function of this pathway has not been well characterized in differentiated somatic cells and there is lack of consensus on the role of the pathway in somatic tumorigenesis. To shed light on this conundrum, we examined the PIWI pathway in colon cancer through a combination of bioinformatic analyses and cell-based assays. Shifted Weighted Annotation Network (SWAN) analysis revealed that the pathway experiences significant allelic losses in colon cancer and that PIWIL2, the main catalytic component of the pathway responsible for TE silencing, experiences the highest percent deletions. PIWIL2 is downregulated in colon tumors of advanced stage, nodal metastasis, and in certain subtypes, correlating with poor survival, while it is even downregulated in ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that predisposes to colon cancer. Knockout studies in colon epithelial Caco2 cells show that PIWIL2 depletion leads to increased anchorage-independent growth, increased LINE-1 levels and activity, and in DNA damage, altogether highlighting a tumor-suppressing role of PIWIL2 in the colon. SUMMARY STATEMENT This study investigates the PIWI-piRNA pathway in colon cancer using a nuanced bioinformatic and cell-based approach, linking the downregulation of PIWIL2 to disease progression, transposable element activation and DNA damage.">

 A deeper understanding of the complicated transcriptional landscape of human breast cancers are vital to identifying more efficacious treatments. Investigating genetic variations among breast cancer subtypes at a single-cell level holds the potential to enhance our understanding of cancer formation, progression, and elucidate actionable targets. In this study, we compile single-cell RNA sequencing data from patient tumors and matched lymph metastasis, reduction mammoplasties, breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs), and cell lines, forming a diverse dataset consisting of 117 samples with a total of 506,719 cells. These samples include hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes, along with isogenic model pairs. Within this study, we outline the similarities and differences across these models and patient samples, and assess therapeutic drug efficacy based on subtype proportions. Within the TNBC subtype, PDX models exhibited a closer resemblance to patient samples in terms of tumor heterogeneity and cell cycle features compared to cell lines. Acquired drug resistance in TNBC PDX tumors was linked to an increase in basal-like cell proportions, as defined by SCSubtype and TNBCtype cell typing predictors. Cell-wise subtyping revealed all patient samples comprised a mix of subtypes; notably, HR+ lymph node metastases had a lower proportion of HER2-Enriched cells compared to matched primary tumors. PDXOs displayed differences in metabolic-related transcripts relative to matched PDX tumors. Correlative analyses of cytotoxic drugs on PDX cells demonstrated that therapeutic efficacy was dependent on subtype proportions. Herein we provide an extensive multi-model dataset, a dynamic approach to cell-wise sample annotation, and a thorough examination of models within human breast cancer systems. This analysis and reference resource will support informed decision-making in preclinical research and therapeutic development by establishing model limitations, subtype-specific insights, and novel targetable pathways.

        <tr id="Compelling evidences have manifested that breast cancer cells prefer to metastasize to certain distant organs, including brain, lung, bone and liver. According to the canonical “seed and soil” theory, this prominent biological behavior, termed as metastatic organotropism, involves intricate interactions between breast cancer cells (the “seeds”) and specific residents in the tumor microenvironment (the “soil”), initiating from pre-metastatic niche formation to metastatic outgrowth. Recently, multifaceted heterogeneity of tissue-specific macrophages (TSMs) and their roles played in organotropic metastases of breast cancer are incrementally unveiled. Herein, we decipher multiple diversities of TSMs, including evolvement, profiles, functions and metabolic characteristics under different polarization states. Further, we elaborate on bidirectional effects of TSMs on metastatic organotropism of breast cancer (both to the “seeds” and “soil”), and unearth underlying signaling pathways based on updated mechanistic researches. Lastly, we compile a series of clinical trials, hoping to illuminate promising TSM-targeting therapies against breast cancer organotropic metastases. Graphical Abstract">

 Background:
 Intratumoral heterogeneity, driven by phenotypic plasticity, contributes to disease progression and therapy failures. However, a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms is still lacking. Breast cancer exemplifies this with its histological and molecular diversity; estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), progesterone receptor-positive (PR+), and HER2- luminal A subtypes, such as the MCF7 cell line, are not the exception. While single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and three-dimensional multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) represent initial approaches to understanding heterogeneity, integrating these tools with computational strategies offers new paths to uncover the regulatory groundwork of tumor behavior. When modeled via Boolean frameworks, transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) provide a dynamic platform for studying gene interactions, identifying attractors (stable cellular states corresponding to distinct phenotypes), and simulating cellular transitions. This study represents the first step in constructing such a framework for ER+ breast cancer to advance precision medicine and improve therapeutic strategies.
 Methods:
 Regulatory elements relevant to the MCF7 cell line were identified through an extensive review of NCBI literature. Interactions were strictly curated based on evidence quality (ranging from robust experimental validation to predictive hypotheses), and evaluated for type and significance, such as feedback loops, activation, coactivation, and inhibition. Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) were used to translate regulatory connections into Boolean functions to simulate binary gene expression dynamics. The final TRN was visualized using Cytoscape (v3.10.3) with a hierarchical layout.
 Results:
 The TRN consists of 54 nodes and 81 interactions, representing the regulatory landscape of ER+, PR+, and HER2- breast cancer. Boolean equations offer a framework for simulating the evolution of binary states to attractors, enabling the observation of how perturbations, such as gene overexpression or silencing, influence heterogeneity. While simulation and attractor analyses are ongoing, the network provides a foundation for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying breast cancer plasticity.
 Conclusions:
 This study highlights the potential of integrating experimental data, TRN reconstruction, and Boolean modeling to understand intratumoral heterogeneity. Our rigorously curated model establishes a foundational framework for precision oncology and the integration of experimental and computational methods.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor survival rate due to late detection. PDAC arises from precursor microscopic lesions, termed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), that develop at least a decade before overt disease--this provides an opportunity to intercept PanIN-to-PDAC progression. However, immune interception strategies require full understanding of PanIN and PDAC cellular architecture. Surgical specimens containing PanIN and PDAC lesions from a unique cohort of five treatment-naïve patients with PDAC were surveyed using spatial-omics (proteomic and transcriptomic). Findings were corroborated by spatial proteomics of PanIN and PDAC from tamoxifen-inducible KPC (tiKPC) mice. We uncovered the organization of lymphoid cells into tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) adjacent to PanIN lesions. These TLSs lacked CD21+CD23+ B cells compared to more mature TLSs near the PDAC border. PanINs harbored mostly CD4+ T cells with fewer Tregs and exhausted T cells than PDAC. Peri-tumoral space was enriched with naïve CD4+ and central memory T cells. These observations highlight the opportunity to modulate the immune microenvironment in PanINs before immune exclusion and immunosuppression emerge during progression into PDAC.">

        <tr id="Cancer progression remains a significant clinical challenge. Phenotypic adaptation by tumour cells results in disease heterogeneity, which drives treatment resistance and immune escape. T-cell immunotherapy, while effective at treating some cancer subtypes, can also fail due to limits on tumour immunogenicity or T-cell recognition. For example, one potential contributor to immune escape involves the density and alignment of the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding tumours, also known as tumour-associated collagen signature (TACS). However, the specific mechanisms by which aligned fibres contribute to decreased patient survival rates have not yet been decoupled. Here, we developed EVO-ACT (EVOlutionary agent-based cancer T-cell interaction), a two-dimensional agent-based modelling framework designed to investigate how different TACS architectures impact tumour evolution and dynamic interactions with CD8[Formula: see text] T cells. Our results highlight that TACS-driven modulation of T-cell dynamics, combined with phenotypic adaptation, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, underlies differences in tumour immunogenicity and the application of our model can successfully recapitulate clinically observed breast cancer survival trends.">

 Background:
 Osimertinib resistance in patients with EGFR-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) contributes to mortality. Targeting bypass alterations have had limited efficacy. Here, we explored the role of CD105 (endoglin) expression, a co-receptor for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling as a factor of osimertinib treatment.
 Methods:
 Sixty-six NSCLC tumors, 44 of which had EGFR mutations were subjected to imaging mass cytometry to identify CD105 expression status as a predictor of clinical outcomes. To study the effects of EGFR and CD105 disruption two osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutant cell lines were developed for subsequent characterization by single cell RNA sequencing. The promoter chromatin status and glycolytic state of the lines were evaluated by ATAC sequencing and Single Cell ENergetIc metabolism by profiling Translation inHibition analysis (SCENITH), respectively.
 Results:
 There was an inverse correlation between the expression CD105 and overall survival in treatment-naïve patients (
 P
 = 0.0071). Modeling osimertinib resistance highlighted the emergence of a persister cell population expressing tumor dormancy features. Further, the persister cells were found to have elevated CD105 levels with responsivity to the neutralizing antibody, carotuximab (ENV105), in restoring epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming to support osimertinib sensitivity. The carotuximab mechanism of action was through the re-engagement of EGFR signaling by potentiating physical CD105/EGFR interaction. Combination of osimertinib and carotuximab significantly reduced tumor growth in two independent NSCLC mouse models (
 P
 = 0.0056 and
 P =
 0.0008), where either single agent had little benefit.
 Conclusions:
 CD105 targeting provides a novel mutation-independent strategy to overcome resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Based on the efficacy of carotuximab capacity to limit tumor dormancy and restored osimertinib sensitivity, a Phase 1 trial (NCT05401110) investigating the combination therapy is currently accruing subjects.

 Background:
 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accounting for 70%-90% of primary liver cancers, often involves portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), a significant adverse prognostic factor linked to worsened liver function and treatment challenges. This study uses multi-omics analysis to investigate the tumor immune microenvironment in HCC with PVTT, focusing on the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in PVTT formation and identifying potential therapeutic targets to improve clinical outcomes.
 Methods:
 We utilized nCounter technology, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), digital spatial profiling (DSP), and Olink proteomics to investigate intra-tumoral spatial heterogeneity from transcriptomics, proteomics, and immunology perspectives. Key molecules promoting PVTT formation were identified via differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis, spatial expression and single-cell analysis. Identified Acarbose as a potential drug for treating PVTT was conducted using 3D QSAR, pharmacophore modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations. The clinical potential of Acarbose targeting NID1 in PVTT treatment was further validated through cell proliferation assays, immune-functional mouse models, immunofluorescence, and real-world clinical data analysis.
 Results:
 A comprehensive multi-omics analysis of 85 samples from 47 HCC patients revealed that myofibroblast-associated cells (myCAFs) dominate the tumor microenvironment (TME) of PVTT, shaping a tumor immune-suppressive environment. The macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT) induced myCAF formation, establishing an immune barrier in the primary tumor. A cross-analysis of DEGs from DSP data and scRNA-seq identified Nidogen1 (NID1) as a key gene driving PVTT formation. NID1 was upregulated in MMT cells and myCAFs within the PVTT TME, contributing to immunosuppression and PVTT formation. Computational virtual screening identified acarbose as a potential therapeutic agent. When combined with tislelizumab, acarbose significantly enhanced T cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, inhibited tumor growth, and reduced NID1 expression, demonstrating superior efficacy compared to anti-PD-1 monotherapy, both in vitro and in vivo. Real-world data showed that long-term use of acarbose in diabetic HCC patients reduced NID1 levels and prevented PVTT formation, supporting acarbose as a promising strategy to target NID1 and inhibit PVTT.
 Conclusions:
 Our findings demonstrate the critical role of myCAFs in shaping the tumor immune-suppressive environment that promotes PVTT formation. Targeting NID1, a key driver of this process, with acarbose effectively disrupts the myCAF-mediated immune barrier and synergistically enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy.

 Background:
 Pleural mesothelioma (PM) is an aggressive malignancy that harbors significant inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Spatial transcriptomics enables the dissection of the tumor's molecular architecture by facilitating compartment-specific gene expression profiling. We performed high-resolution RNA-seq analysis of tumor (Tm) and stroma (St) compartments in PM samples to identify gene expression patterns and their association with clinical outcomes.
 Methods:
 Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from untreated PM patients (pts) across three institutions were analyzed using the NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) platform. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected based on histopathological features and fluorescently labeled antibodies for tumor and stromal areas. RNA expression of >1800 genes from selected ROIs was analyzed using GeoMx Cancer Transcriptome Atlas (CTA). Differential gene expression was assessed utilizing R “limma” package. A cutoff of absolute fold change ≥1 and p-value <0.05, with the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate method, was applied to identify significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Elastic Net regression optimized through cross-validation methods was employed to identify genes associated with overall survival (OS) outcomes. Data from the TCGA PanCancer Atlas was utilized for external validation.
 Results:
 A total of 72 pts, 80.3% male, median age of 71y (range: 44-94) were identified for the analysis. Among them, 87.5% (63/72) were epithelioid (Ep) and 12.5% (9/72) non-epithelioid (NEp). After quality control, RNA data was available from 71 and 67 pts in Tm and St compartments, respectively. Across 132 ROIs in the Tm compartment, we identified 4 significantly DEGs between NEp (upregulated
 COL5A2, THBS1
 ; downregulated
 CLU, KRT19
 ) and Ep subgroups. No DEG between Ep and NEp subgroups were identified in 115 ROIs from the St compartment. Unsupervised clustering identified four molecular subgroups with distinct gene expression in the Tm compartment, of which Cluster 1 showed significantly decreased OS (6.3m vs. 16.4m; HR 3.3,
 p
 =0.001). Elastic Net regression identified 31 genes predictive of OS (R² = 0.43, Harrell’s c-index = 0.87), including nine genes (
 IFNGR2, FCER1G, MFGE8, CKLF, CBL, HLA-DRB3, HK1, PLAT, CD163
 ) associated with worse prognosis. Tumors in Cluster 1 demonstrated higher expression of these genes. External validation using the TCGA cohort confirmed four genes
 IFNGR2
 (
 p
 = 0.02),
 CBL
 (
 p
 = 0.01),
 HK1
 (
 p
 <0.001),
 PLAT
 (
 p
 <0.001), as significantly associated with decreased OS in PM.
 Conclusions:
 Spatially resolved transcriptomic profiling suggests Tm-enriched regions as the primary drivers of PM subtype and aggressiveness, identifying nine genes and a molecular subgroup associated with poorer survival outcomes. Further validation and functional studies are warranted.

        <tr id="Tumor associated neutrophils (TANs) exert dual and opposing functions in tumors, acting pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic, depending on tumor progression, polarization state and subtype. Consequently, the prognostic impact of TANs in breast cancer is also contradictory. Since neutrophils are critically needed to fight infections in cancer patients, the mediators leading to tumor progression need more investigation as potential future targets. The neutrophil derived mediator myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a peroxidase with dual functions in tumors, acting both immune enhancing and suppressing. Patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have aggressive tumors with a dismal prognosis and urgently need novel treatment strategies. Therefore, we here aimed to investigate the prognostic impact of TANs, MPO+ TANs and MPO+ non-neutrophils using a cohort with newly diagnosed MBC patients specifically. We show that high infiltration of MPO+ TANs and MPO+ non-neutrophils in the primary tumor (PT), was associated with clinicopathological features and worse prognosis in patients with MBC. However, only infiltration of MPO+ TANs showed independent prognostic impact in multivariable analysis adjusting for other prognostic factors in MBC. The results need to be validated in a larger cohort but suggests that MPO targeting strategies could be relevant in breast cancer patients with aggressive disease.

        <tr id="Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth commonest malignant tumor among women worldwide and is characterized by high heterogeneity and a complex ecosystem. A comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneity of tumors and the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for effective CC management. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool that can be employed to unveil the heterogeneity of tumors and the TME, as well as to elucidate the evolutionary trajectories of tumors. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology, on the other hand, can address the complexity and diversity of the spatial microenvironment of tumors, thereby compensating for the limitations of scRNA-seq. As emerging technologies, both scRNA-seq and ST are increasingly being utilized in CC research. In this review, we summarized the latest advancements in scRNA-seq and ST for CC, with a focus on investigating tumor heterogeneity, the TME, tumor evolutionary trajectories, treatment resistance mechanisms, and potential therapeutic targets. These insights collectively contribute to the development of more effective treatment and prevention strategies for CC.">

        <tr id="Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer, and despite significant therapeutic advances over the past decade, a substantial number of patients still progress to a fatal outcome. The initiation and progression of melanoma are strongly influenced by interactions between melanoma cells and other components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we focus on the interplay between fibroblasts resident in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells. In particular, we examine the molecular mechanisms through which melanoma cells induce the transformation of resident fibroblasts into their active form, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We also explore the role of CAFs in shaping the melanoma microenvironment (MME) and in organizing the pre-metastatic niche, a specialized microenvironment that forms in distant organs or tissues to support the survival and expansion of metastatic melanoma cells. Finally, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting the interactions between CAFs, melanoma cells, and other components of the tumor microenvironment to improve treatment outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Zwilch Kinetochore Protein(ZWILCH) has been reported to prevent cells from prematurely exiting mitosis. However, the underlying mechanisms or involvement of ZWILCH in the tumor immune microenvironment in various cancers remain largely unknown. Methods Generalized dysregulation of ZWILCH was observed through the whole transcriptome analysis in this study. The spatial transcriptome analysis was utilized to identify expressed regions of ZWILCH. Next, cells that mainly expressed ZWILCH in the tumor microenvironment were determined using the single-cell transcriptome analysis. Also, the “cellchat” R package was applied to estimate the effect of ZWILCH on malignant cell communication. Combining multiple analytic approaches including GSEA, GSVA, KEGG enrichment analysis, and Aucell, with TCPA functional protein data, Genome-wide CRISPR screening, potential functions of ZWILCH and the pathways in which ZWILCH participated were thoroughly exploited. Univariate Cox regression analysis calculated the association between ZWILCH and cancer patients’ adverse outcomes. Results ZWILCH is universally highly expressed in tumors. The spatial transcriptome analysis showed that ZWILCH overexpression comes from the tumoral region or mixed tumoral region. At the single-cell level, ZWILCH is chiefly expressed by malignant cells and proliferative T cells. The expression of ZWILCH mRNA is positively correlated with cell proliferation, repair of DNA damage, and cell cycle score. Plenty of metabolic pathways are inhibited in patients with high expression of ZWILCH. Moreover, after ZWILCH knockout, a large number of cancer cell lines are stagnated, inhibited, or died. Additionally, the malignant cells with positive expression of ZWILCH have a stronger ability for cell communication. In short, ZWILCH is meant to be a risk factor for clinical outcomes of multiple tumors. Conclusions ZWILCH is a promising therapeutic target that influences patient prognosis by participating in cell proliferation, cell communication, and reshaping the tumor microenvironment across different cancers.

        <tr id="Pancreatic cancer (PC) is marked by extensive heterogeneity, posing significant challenges to effective treatment. The tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), plays a critical role in driving PC progression. However, the prognostic and functional contributions of distinct CAF subtypes remain inadequately understood. Here, we introduce a novel 7-gene risk model that not only robustly stratifies PC patients but also unveils the unique role of PHLDA1 as a key mediator in tumor-stroma crosstalk.By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA sequencing data, we comprehensively characterized the heterogeneity of CAFs in PC. We identified five CAF subtypes and focused on matrix CAFs (mCAFs), which were strongly associated with poor prognosis. A 7-gene mCAF-associated risk model was constructed using advanced machine learning algorithms, and the biological significance of PHLDA1 was validated through co-culture experiments and pan-cancer analyses.Our multiomics analysis revealed that the novel 7-gene model (comprising USP36, KLF5, MT2A, KDM6B, PHLDA1, REL, and DDIT4) accurately predicts patient survival, immunotherapy response, and TME status. Notably, PHLDA1 was uniquely overexpressed in CAFs and correlated with the activation of key protumorigenic pathways, including EMT, KRAS, and TGF-β, underscoring its central role in modulating the crosstalk between CAFs and malignant ductal cells. Pan-cancer analysis further supported PHLDA1’s prognostic and immunomodulatory significance across multiple tumor types.Our study presents a novel 7-gene prognostic model that significantly enhances risk stratification in PC and identifies PHLDA1+ CAFs as promising prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. These findings provide new insights into the TME of PC and open avenues for personalized treatment strategies.">

Single-cell analysis of host–microbiome interactions (SAHMI) is a pipeline used to systematically recover and denoise microbial signals in human clinical tissues and examine tumor–microbiome interactions at the single-cell transcriptome level. In a large GC cohort, we used SAHMI to detect 12 bacteria, among which Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was widely present in multiple tumor and normal samples. Meanwhile, we verified the presence of H. pylori in GC tissues via fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze 11 cell populations, including B cells, T cells, and epithelial cells, and these cell types contained large numbers of H. pylori. We detected obvious enrichment of H. pylori in cancer cells and identified 13 upregulated differentially expressed genes exhibiting significantly negative correlations with patient survival in the H. pylori-positive tumor group compared with the findings in the other groups, indicating that these genes could represent prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for H. pylori-infected patients with GC. Moreover, H. pylori-enriched immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages, were associated with cell-type-specific gene expression and pathway activities, including cell fate and immune signaling. In summary, tumor–microbiome interactions might reflect or influence tumorigenesis in GC, which has implications for clinical practice.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by significant heterogeneity and a poor prognosis. M2 macrophages (M2) play a crucial role in the microenvironment of PDAC, yet their exact functional significance remains poorly understood. This study sought to explore the potential communication and clinical implications of M2 in PDAC. The differentiation pathway of M2 and their interaction with malignant PDAC cells were analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Additionally, a prognostic signature related to M2 marker genes was constructed and analyzed using bulk RNA sequencing. Three distinct differentiation states of M2 were characterized, each exhibiting unique transcription factor expression profiles and signaling pathway activations. Potential intercellular communication between M2, PDAC malignant cells, and fibroblasts was initially observed at the level of computer analysis. The prognostic model was identified through the LASSO algorithm. Patients stratified by risk level displayed significant variations in prognostic indicators such as signaling pathway activity, gene mutation frequency, immune cell infiltration, and drug sensitivity. These findings are of course preliminary, and future in vitro/in vivo experiments will be needed to knock out these signature genes or ligand-receptor pairs of genes in macrophages to validate their role in macrophage development.

 Background: Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is considered an incurable disease and understanding the molecular mechanisms at the basis of tumor progression has become mandatory. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) constitute a population of rare cells that are shed in the bloodstream by primary and metastatic tumors and migrate towards distant organs. The molecular characterization of CTCs is a powerful tool to better investigate the mechanisms underlying metastasis. In this study, we combine phenotypic and transcriptional profiling of CTCs isolated from MBC patients to infer the mechanisms involved in their biology, also in relation to the metastatic site and their phenotypic features. Methods: Blood samples for CTC analysis were collected from luminal MBC patients recruited in the KENDO study (Protocol code: IRST174.19); CTCs were enriched using the RosetteSep CTC Enrichment Cocktail and frozen until downstream analyses as viable cells. To validate the antibody staining for phenotypic analysis, tests were conducted using the cancer cell line SKBR-3. In brief, SKBR-3 cells were spiked in peripheral blood of a healthy volunteer and enriched using RosetteSep CTC Enrichment Cocktail. Enriched SKBR-3 and patients’ CTCs were incubated with antibodies targeting CD45 (leukocyte marker) and epithelial markers (E-tag; EpCAM, E-cadherin) for phenotypic analysis using the DEPArray NxT platform. For transcriptomic profiling, single CTCs were isolated as single, viable cells. Libraries were prepared using the QIAseq UPX 3’ Transcriptome Kit and sequenced using MiSeq on V3-150 cycles cartridges. Bioinformatic and statistical analyses were carried out using the CLC Genomic Workbench. Results: Through feasibility analysis conducted on SKBR-3 cells, we demonstrate that our workflow involving phenotypic analysis on DEPArray NxT is an efficient tool to identify cancer cells (CD45-/E-tag+) and white blood cells (WBCs; CD45+/E-tag-). In MBC samples, we detected different cell populations: WBCs (CD45+/E-tag-), CTCs (CD45-/E-tag+), and dual-positive CTCs (CD45+/E-tag+; dpCTCs). Transcriptomic profiling was successfully performed on 37 single CTCs isolated from 7 patients. The transcriptional profile of CTCs is consistent with breast malignancy for different databases including ClinVar2019, DisGeNet, and Human Phenotype Ontology. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment analysis highlighted pathways associated with synapse organization and calcium channel activity, suggesting the implication of the interplay between cancer cells and neurons in metastasis. Compared to a commercial RNA, CTCs express at high levels transcripts associated with cancer dissemination and genome architecture (i.e., STAG2 and H2AFZ). In CTCs from patients with bone metastasis we detected the expression of genes associated with metastatic osteotropism (i.e., S100A4, VAPA, HMGB1), while CTCs from a single patient with gastric metastasis expressed genes associated with gastric cancer metastasis and cell redox homeostasis. Transcriptional profiling of dpCTCs revealed the expression of transcripts encoding for members of the CD47/SIRPα axis, supporting their macrophage-cancer cell fusion origin, and increased glycogen biosynthetic and metabolic activity. Conclusions: Our data suggest the potential of CTC based transcriptomics in providing new insights on the clinical-biological evaluation of MBC and its mechanisms underlying metastatic cascade and organotropism. In addition, our data provide hints for the characterization of dpCTCs, a poorly studied population whose role in metastasis is still far to be fully elucidated.

        <tr id="Background Cell type-specific transcriptional heterogeneity in embryonic mouse skin is well-documented, but few studies have investigated the regulatory mechanisms. Here, we present high-throughput single-cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptome sequencing (HT-scCAT-seq), a method that simultaneously profiles transcriptome and chromatin accessibility. We utilized HT-scCAT-seq to dissect the gene regulatory mechanism governing epidermal stratification, periderm terminal differentiation, and fibroblast specification. Results By linking chromatin accessibility to gene expression, we identify candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and their target genes which are crucial for dermal and epidermal development. We describe cells with similar gene expression profiles that exhibit distinct chromatin accessibility statuses during periderm terminal differentiation. Finally, we characterize the underlying lineage-determining transcription factors and demonstrate that ALX4 and RUNX2 are candidate transcription factors regulators of the dermal papilla lineage development through in silico perturbation analysis and CUT&Tag experiment. Conclusions Overall, HT-scCAT-seq represents a powerful tool for unraveling the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene regulation in single cells. Our results advance the understanding of embryonic skin development while providing a scalable framework for investigating regulatory mechanisms across diverse biological systems and disease contexts.

        <tr id="Tumor immune microenvironment plays a crucial role in determining the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), with the interaction of immune cells within this microenvironment contributing to a poorer prognosis. We sought to investigate the causal relationship and underlying biological mechanisms between immune cell characteristics and LUAD to offer new insights for enhancing treatment strategies. We evaluated the association between immune cell characteristics and LUAD using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis based on genome-wide association studies summary statistics. Sensitivity analysis was performed to verify the robustness of MR results. Immune cell infiltration analysis and machine learning on bulk RNA-sequencing data were conducted to further identify immune cells associated with LUAD. Prognostic genes of LUAD were identified using single-cell RNA-sequencing data and high dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis. MR analysis identified three immune cell characteristics associated with LUAD, including CCR2 on granulocyte, CD25 on CD45RA + CD4 not Treg, and plasmacytoid dendritic cell, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the associations. Machine learning identified neutrophils, hematopoietic stem cells, B cells, and myeloid progenitor cells as key immune cell characteristics related to LUAD. Neutrophil was identified as the target cell of LUAD based on the MR analysis and machine learning. Subcequently, single-cell RNA-sequencing mapped the immune microenvironment of LUAD and identified down-regulated neutrophil. In addition, robust neutrophil-macrophage communication in LUAD was revealed using the CellChat package. Finally, nine neutrophil-related prognostic genes of LUAD were identified, three of which potentially regulated neutrophil-macrophage communication. This study showed a significant correlation between neutrophil and LUAD, particularly highlighting the neutrophil-macrophage communication. This finding may enhance our comprehension of LUAD immune microenvironment and hopefully promote the discovery of new immunotherapeutic targets for LUAD and the development of related drugs.">

A prognostic model was constructed using WGCNA and LASSO regression, and a nomogram was developed by integrating clinicopathological variables. Differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor mutation burden (TMB), immune checkpoint expression, and drug sensitivities were evaluated between risk groups. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to investigate stemness-related cell types. Functional assays were conducted to validate the role of AKAP12 in OC progression. Results Three distinct stemness-related subgroups were identified with significant differences in prognosis and immunological features. Fibroblasts were identified as major contributors to the maintenance of stemness traits in the TME. AKAP12 was found to be positively associated with stemness phenotypes. Knockdown of AKAP12 reduced tumor sphere formation, impaired cell migration, and enhanced cisplatin sensitivity. Immunohistochemistry in clinical samples and OC organoids confirmed the correlation between AKAP12 and the immune checkpoint molecule OX40L. Conclusion This study establishes a novel stemness-related gene signature for prognosis prediction and therapeutic stratification in OC. AKAP12 was identified as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target, offering new avenues for precision treatment in stemness-driven OC.">

        <tr id="Background Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are essential components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), contributing to tumorigenesis, progression, and resistance to therapy. However, the functional diversity of CAF subpopulations and their role in tumor progression and patient prognosis remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore CAF heterogeneity and their functional roles in the TME using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and multi-omics data analysis. Methods scRNA-seq data were analyzed to cluster CAF subpopulations in the TME, with key genes identified through functional annotation. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed, and prognostic genes were selected via Cox and LASSO regression. A risk score model (RiskScore) was developed for survival prediction and immune therapy sensitivity evaluation. Core CAF genes were examined using siRNA interference, qPCR, and Western blotting. Drug sensitivity was assessed to explore the clinical relevance of these genes. Results Four CAF subpopulations (CAF-0, CAF-1, CAF-2, CAF-3) were identified, revealing differences in key tumor-associated signaling pathways (e.g., MYC, WNT, TGF-β). Thirteen core genes related to prognosis were identified, and a RiskScore model was developed, showing significantly worse survival rates for high-risk patients (p < 0.001) and features of immune suppression, including increased M0 macrophage infiltration. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that core genes (e.g., KLRB1, MAP1B) were linked to drug sensitivity, suggesting potential biomarkers for targeted therapy. Experimental validation showed that knockdown of the HIP1R gene significantly reduced tumor cell expression, confirming its critical role in tumor development. Conclusion This study offers a comprehensive analysis of CAF heterogeneity and its impact on TME, patient prognosis, and drug sensitivity. The developed RiskScore model provides theoretical support for personalized treatment based on CAF-related genes, offering new insights into CAF-driven tumor progression and potential targets for precision oncology and immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Lineage plasticity is recognized as a critical determinant of lethality and resistance to AR pathway inhibitors in prostate cancer. Lineage plasticity is a continuum, ranging from AR activity-low tumors, AR-null tumors that do not express a neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) program (i.e., double-negative prostate cancer [DNPC]), and AR-null NEPC tumors. Factors upregulated early in lineage plasticity are not well-characterized. The clarification of such factors is essential to identify tumors undergoing lineage plasticity or at risk of this occurring. Our integrative analysis of metastatic prostate cancer patient tumors, patient-derived xenografts, and cell models determined that PROX1 is upregulated early in the lineage plasticity continuum and progressively increases as tumors lose AR activity. We determined DNA methylation is a key regulator of PROX1 expression. PROX1 suppression in DNPC and NEPC reduces cell survival and impacts apoptosis and differentiation, demonstrating PROX1’s functional importance. PROX1 is not directly targetable with standard drug development approaches. However, affinity immunopurification demonstrated histone deacetylases (HDACs) are among the top PROX1-interacting proteins; HDAC inhibition depletes PROX1 and recapitulates PROX1 suppression in DNPC and NEPC. Altogether, our results suggest PROX1 promotes the emergence of lineage plasticity, and HDAC inhibition is a promising approach to treat tumors across the lineage plasticity continuum.">

        <tr id="Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy without effective treatment due to limited knowledge of its development and tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and high-resolution spatial transcriptomics are employed to comprehensively investigate the development trajectories and the TME. The results revealed that PSCC cells mimicked the differentiation and tissue organization of normal penile epithelium, independent of the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection status. Notably, a spatial subtype, Tum_1, appeared at early stage of tumor differentiation and in tumor-normal boundary regions. This subtype exhibited enhanced basal-like and stemness features and showed high LAMC2 expression, which activated laminin-integrin signaling via ITGA6/ITGB4, promoting tumor invasiveness. Furthermore, the results indicated that HPV-positive basal stem-like neoplasms dampened the immune function of T cells and macrophages, promoting an immunosuppressive environment that facilitates tumor progression. Supporting this, the patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma who have high expression of HPV-positive Tum_1 signatures derived greater benefit from PD-1 blockade therapy. In summary, the findings provide a comprehensive spatial landscape of the PSCC TME and suggest potential treatment approaches targeting laminin-integrin interaction and immunotherapy, especially in HPV-positive patients.">

        <tr id="Cellular senescence exerts dual roles in lung cancer pathogenesis: initially suppressing tumorigenesis via p53/p21/p16-mediated cell cycle arrest, but promoting malignancy through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP secretes cytokines, proteases, and growth factors, reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) to drive immune evasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance. NF-κB activation induces APOBEC3B mutagenesis and PD-L1 overexpression, while mTOR signaling enhances glycolysis and OXPHOS to fuel tumor growth. Clinically, telomere attrition, p16/p21 expression, and SASP components serve as prognostic biomarkers. Therapeutic strategies target senescent cells and SASP. Future directions focus on single-cell multi-omics to decode senescence heterogeneity, spatially controlled drug delivery, and therapies targeting senescence-immune-metabolic crosstalk. By unraveling senescence’s dual regulatory mechanisms, this review highlights precision approaches to overcome resistance and improve lung cancer outcomes.">

        <tr id="Cancer metastasis constitutes a multifactorial phenomenon that continues to confound therapeutic strategies. The biochemical signals governing motile phenotypes have been extensively characterized, but mechanobiological interactions have only recently been integrated into cancer cell motility models and remain less well elucidated. The identification of the biochemically and mechanically controlled epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells, which occurs either completely or partially, has led to a major breakthrough and a universal phenomenon in cancers. In addition, a relatively new theory based on mechanobiological aspects called “jamming-to-unjamming transition” is being proposed to explain the transition of cancer cells to an invasive phenotype. The latter transition may help to better understand the different types of 3D migration and invasion of cancer cells. Similarly to EMT, the transition from jamming to unjamming seems to be controlled by molecular and physical factors, including cell mechanics and mechanical cues from the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumor microenvironment (TME). It is challenging to grasp the distinctions between the transition from jamming to unjamming and EMT, as they appear to be the same at first glance. However, upon closer examination, the two transitions are quite separate. Moreover, it is still unclear whether both transitions may act synergistically. This review highlights the most important breakthroughs in the transition from jamming to unjamming, with a focus on mechanobiology and extracellular environmental aspects, and it compares them with those of EMT. In addition, the impact of the TME, such as ECM scaffold and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on the jamming-to-unjamming transition is discussed. Finally, the research frontiers and future directions in the field of mechanobiological research in cancer metastasis are outlined.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presents significant intertumoral heterogeneity, complicating prognosis and treatment. To address this, we performed an integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of HCC specimens using Seurat and identified malignant cells via Infercnv. Through a systematic evaluation of 101 machine learning algorithms used in combination, we developed tumor-cell-specific gene signatures (TCSGs) that demonstrated strong predictive performance, with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.72 to 0.74 in independent validation cohorts. Risk stratification based on these signatures revealed distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities: high-risk patients showed increased sensitivity to sorafenib, while low-risk patients exhibited enhanced responses to immunotherapy and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Pharmacogenomic analysis with Oncopredict identified four chemotherapeutic agents, including sapitinib and dinaciclib, with risk-dependent efficacy patterns. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-dependency screening prioritized SRSF7 as essential for HCC cell survival, a finding confirmed by the identification of protein-level overexpression in tumors via immunohistochemistry. This multi-omics framework bridges single-cell characterization to clinical decision-making, offering a clinically actionable prognostic system that can be used to optimize therapeutic selection in HCC management.">

        <tr id="Background Targeted therapy interventions using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) provide encouraging treatment responses in patients with ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinomas, yet resistance occurs almost inevitably. In addition to tumor cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms, accumulating evidence suggests that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor microenvironment contribute to therapy resistance. This study aimed to investigate CAF-driven molecular networks that shape the therapeutic susceptibility of ALK-driven lung adenocarcinoma cells. Methods Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid co-cultures comprising ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma cells and CAFs were utilized to model the tumor microenvironment. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to uncover transcriptional differences between TKI-treated homotypic and heterotypic spheroids. Functional assays assessed the effects of CAF-conditioned medium and CAF-secreted factors on tumor cell survival, proliferation, lipid metabolism, and downstream AKT signaling. The therapeutic potential of targeting metabolic vulnerabilities was evaluated using pharmacological inhibition of lipid metabolism and by ferroptosis induction. Results CAFs significantly diminished the apoptotic response of lung tumor cells to ALK inhibitors while simultaneously enhancing their proliferative capacity. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified lipogenesis-associated genes as a key transcriptional difference between TKI-treated homotypic and heterotypic lung tumor spheroids. CAF-conditioned medium and the CAF-secreted factors HGF and NRG1 activated AKT signaling in 3D-cultured ALK-rearranged lung tumor cells, leading to increased de novo lipogenesis and suppression of lipid peroxidation. These metabolic adaptations were critical for promoting tumor cell survival and fostering therapy resistance. Notably, both dual inhibition of ALK and the lipid-regulatory factor SREBP-1, as well as co-treatment with ferroptosis inducers such as erastin or RSL3, effectively disrupted the CAF-driven metabolic-supportive niche and restored sensitivity of resistant lung tumor spheroids to ALK inhibition. Conclusions This study highlights a critical role for CAFs in mediating resistance to ALK-TKIs by reprogramming lipid metabolism in ALK-rearranged lung cancer cells. It suggests that targeting these metabolic vulnerabilities, particularly through inhibition of lipid metabolism or induction of ferroptosis, could provide a novel therapeutic approach to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Ferroptosis has been implicated in the regulation of the tumor immune environment; however, its precise effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors remains contradictory.


OBJECTIVE
To elucidate the "double-edged sword effect" of a key ferroptosis-related factor in regulating the immune microenvironment.


METHODS
This study utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the tumor microenvironment in ovarian cancer samples from immunotherapy cohorts. Following quality control and variable gene screening, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), GENE EXPRESSION OMNIBUS (GEO), bulk, and spatial transcriptome databases were analyzed. The AddModuleScore_UCell function was employed for gene set scoring by evaluating the expression patterns of specific gene features in single-cell datasets, which were found to correlate with interactions between tumor cells and stromal cells, recognized as key contributors in the immunosuppressive milieu. Immunohistochemistry, western blot, and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) analyses were employed to explore the HMOX1/TGF-β1/PI3K/AKT/NF-κB(p65) signaling pathways. In vitro findings were further validated in a mouse model. The correlation between risk factors and progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods.


RESULTS
We demonstrated decreased expression of the ferroptosis-activating gene HMOX1 in ovarian cancer epithelial cells, while being upregulated in macrophages. Ovarian cancer (OV) epithelial cells with HMOX1 inhibition could secrete TGF-β1 to activate three macrophage subtypes: SPP1+, FOLR2+ and C1QC+ via the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB (p65) pathway. The up-regulation of HMOX1 in macrophages also activated these three macrophage subtypes via the NF-κB pathway. Both pathways simultaneously inhibited Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) activation and contributed to the immunosuppressive microenvironment of ovarian cancer, as demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo models. Targeting HMOX1 alone, whether through activation or inhibition, was only effective in modulating a single pathway while simultaneously inducing negative feedback on the opposing pathway, demonstrating the "double-edged sword effect" of HMOX1 in regulating the immune microenvironment.


CONCLUSION
Overall, we proposed and validated two strategies targeting HMOX1 to improve the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors, and confirmed that HMOX1, TGF-β1, SPP1, FOLR2, and C1QC could be used to construct models predicting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors.">

 Background:
 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematological malignancy characterized by impaired differentiation and abnormal proliferation of lymphoblasts. Despite advances in the understanding of its molecular mechanisms, accurate characterization of cellular heterogeneity and genetic alterations remains a challenge. The aim of this study is to take advantage of the scGPT, generative pre-trained transformer model adapted to the genome of one cell, to improve the distinction of cellular clusters and profile gene expression in all. We have used data files including B-cell subtypes and T-cells of ALL. Comparative analyzes with conventional tools, such as scVI and Harmony, have shown an excellent ability to maintain biological variability while providing accurate cell type annotations.
 Methods:
 This study utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to obtain transcriptomic profiles from individual cells. Biological samples were processed through optimized cell capture and library preparation protocols to reduce technical noise and batch effects. NVIDIA GPU powered the computational environment with CUDA acceleration, and key software tools included scVI, scrublet, harmony, and scGPT. Highly variable genes were identified using scVI, leveraging Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to detect nonlinear expression variability. Dimensionality reduction was performed with scVI, producing embeddings corrected for batch effects. Clustering analysis using the Leiden algorithm identified cell subpopulations and visualization tools such as UMAP and t-SNE displayed relationships among cell groups.
 Results:
 Visualization techniques, including UMAP and T-SNE, have confirmed the excellent ability of scGPT to identify rare cell populations and subsets otherwise missed by traditional methods. For example, in B cell subtypes, scGPT successfully distinguished naive B cells, memory B cells, and plasmablasts with high accuracy. Similarly, T cell subtypes such as regulatory T cells and cytotoxic T cells have been clearly characterized. Integration of scGPT with zero-shot learning enabled accurate profiling of gene expression across cell clusters and identified key differentially expressed genes relevant to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) pathology. These were genes associated with cell proliferation, immune evasion and metabolic pathways.
 Conclusions:
 Advanced scGPT modeling has enabled the prediction of potential therapeutic targets and paved the way for tailored interventions. Our research applies scGPT as a key tool to advance single-cell transcriptomic studies in ALL, offering a better understanding of its cellular and molecular complexities. This approach holds promise for improving therapeutic strategies and personalized medicine in hematologic malignancies.

        <tr id="For over a century, scientists reported the disruption of normal nuclear shape and size in cancer. These changes have long been used as tools for diagnosis and staging of malignancies. However, to date, the mechanisms underlying these aberrant nuclear phenotypes and their biological significance remain poorly understood. Using a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the major histological subtypes of pancreatic cancer, we found oncogenic mutant KRAS reduces nuclear size. Transcriptomic and protein expression analysis of mutant KRAS-expressing PDAC cells revealed differential levels of several nuclear envelope-associated genes. Further analysis demonstrated the nuclear lamina protein, Emerin (EMD), acted downstream of KRAS to mediate nuclear size reduction in PDAC. Analysis of human PDAC samples showed that increased EMD expression associates with reduced nuclear size. Finally, in vivo genetic depletion of EMD in a mutant KRAS-driven PDAC model resulted in an increased nuclear size and a reduced incidence of poorly differentiated PDAC. Thus, our data provides evidence of a novel mechanism underlying nuclear size regulation and its impact in PDAC carcinogenesis.">

        <tr id="Background The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex network of cellular and acellular participants, each of which contributes to ensuring tumor growth. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent a key TME population that actively participates in stromal remodeling and metabolic coupling with tumors, significantly favoring both the process of carcinogenesis and the establishment of metastasis. Therefore, developing therapies that target CAFs constitute valuable therapeutic alternatives. However, efficiently modeling the generation of CAFs in the tumor microenvironment is challenging. Methods We constructed a 3D structure of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which we refer to as “TME spheroids”. These spheroids are composed of 4T1 murine breast cancer cells and 3T3 murine fibroblasts, allowing us to mimic the development of a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype. This novel 3D model serves as a platform for evaluating the impact of two natural extracts on TME interactions and their ability to impede tumor progression. Results Using the TME-spheroid model, we tested the effects of two extracts on CAF generation: Anamu-SC obtained from Petiveria alliacea and P2Et from Caesalpinia spinosa. Both extracts disrupted the interaction between tumor cells and fibroblasts, reducing the ability of CAFs to support tumor growth and spread. Conclusions We found that the two extracts interfere with circuits that drive tumor-fibroblast crosstalk, attenuating the phenotype and functional activities associated with CAFs in this TME model.

        <tr id="Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in tumorigenesis, development, metastasis and drug sensitivity, but little is known about it in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Here, the RNA-sequencing data, clinical and survival data of patients with LUSC in The Cancer Genome Atlas and six independent datasets were collected. Based on the unsupervised clustering of knowledge-based functional gene expression signatures, LUSC was classified into four subtypes. Cluster1 and cluster3 exhibited substantial tumor immune infiltration, suggesting a better response to immunotherapy. Relatively worse survival was observed in cluster4, probably due to higher angiogenesis. Besides, differentially expressed genes in cluster1, cluster2 and cluster3 were prominently enriched in immune-related pathways, while extracellular matrix-related pathways were enriched for cluster4. Genomic data analyses showed significant variations in tumor mutational burden and mutational frequency of several genes, such as TP53, among the four subtypes. Additionally, the four subtypes exhibited heterogeneity in the sensitivity of commonly used chemotherapy drugs for lung cancer and the intratumor microbiome profile. Finally, a prognostic model was developed and its performance and generalization ability were independently validated in multiple datasets. Overall, our study advances the understanding of the TME in LUSC and proposes a prognostic model that facilitates clinical decision-making.">

 Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is the standard of care for HER2+ or HER2 low metastatic breast cancer (mBC). However, approximately 20% of patients exhibit resistance to T-DXd therapy. As the development of more antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapies progresses, understanding ADC resistance mechanisms is critical. Our study aims to elucidate the etiology of ADC resistance, such as characterizing molecular changes and identifying novel biomarkers in tumor-immune interactions between T-DXd responsive (R) and non-responsive (NR) patients with mBC. We employed Nanostring’s GeoMX spatial proteomics and transcriptomics profiling technology to analyze 29 metastatic tissue sections (15R, 14NR) from heavily pre-treated patients with HER2+/low mBC, prior to T-DXd treatment. For each section, 6-8 circular regions of interest (ROIs) with a diameter of 300µm were chosen by researchers blinded to T-DXd R vs. NR outcomes and HER2 scores. ROIs were selected to capture spatially diverse tumor-dense and tumor-sparse regions. Immune markers, stromal markers, and HER2 expression levels were quantified for each ROI. Consistent immune and stromal features related to T-DXd resistance were identified across various metastatic sites, including brain, bone, liver, lymph node, chest wall, and lung. NR tumors were characterized by relative immunosuppression and a disorganized immune response, with consistent upregulation of fibronectin and, surprisingly, granzyme B. Local immune response significantly varied based on HER2 expression. Organ-specific characteristics were also observed: Bone metastases showed an increased correlation between various immune markers and fibronectin in NR, suggesting that fibronectin may modulate immune infiltration and promote a supportive microenvironment for tumor growth. In contrast, chest wall metastases showed loss of correlation between various immune markers and smooth muscle actin in NR. This suggests that a remodeled, less dense smooth muscle environment might reduce physical barriers, potentially allowing better immune cell infiltration and activity in responsive tumors. Furthermore, a subset of these patient samples was selected for spatial whole transcriptomic analysis to gain deeper insights.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its pronounced cellular heterogeneity, therapy resistance, and metastatic propensity, traits driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs). Once thought to be a rare, static subpopulation, CSCs are now recognized as a dynamic, plastic cell state influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In this review, we explore the “inner” (genetic, cellular, and metabolic) and “outer” (microenvironmental and macroenvironmental) determinants that govern CSC identity, emergence, and evolution in PDAC. We focus on how acinar and ductal cell plasticity, in combination with oncogenic mutations (e.g., KRAS, TP53), contribute to tumor initiation and CSC generation, how genomic instability further fuels CSC heterogeneity and adaptability, and we highlight how micro and macro TME properties, metabolism and external factors regulate CSC behavior afterwards. Altogether, CSCs exist at the nexus of genetic chaos and environmental cues. Understanding this complex interplay is key to developing therapies that not only eradicate CSCs but also prevent their reemergence. While still far from clinical application, disrupting CSC-supportive networks should be a research and clinical focus for improving outcomes for PDAC patients.">

        <tr id="Liver diseases encompass a wide range of etiologies and involve highly heterogeneous cellular environments, yet the specific cellular states through which genetic risk contributes to disease remain incompletely understood. In this study, we integrated genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from six liver diseases and two metabolic traits with transcriptomic profiles of approximately 168,000 human liver cells at single-cell resolution, using the single-cell disease relevance score (scDRS) approach. Our results revealed that disease-associated genetic signals are predominantly localized to non-parenchymal cells—particularly liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), cholangiocytes, and specific subsets of lymphocytes. Notably, we identified marked intra-cell-type heterogeneity, with disease associations confined to specific subpopulations exhibiting immune activation or stress-responsive transcriptional programs. For example, autoimmune and viral liver diseases were linked to immunologically active LSECs and cholangiocytes, whereas their metabolically active counterparts showed no enrichment. These findings highlight the necessity of resolving liver cell complexity to uncover the functional basis of genetic risk and suggest that susceptibility to liver disease is driven by specialized cell states within broader cellular categories. Our study provides a refined cellular map of liver disease susceptibility, offering new perspectives for understanding pathogenic mechanisms and informing targeted therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a multifaceted and aggressive cancer frequently associated with chronic inflammation and immune cell activation. The pathogenesis of HCC is influenced by a variety of factors such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs, a significant class of non-coding RNAs, contribute to the intricate nature of the transcriptome and are extensively distributed across various tissues and cell types in mammals. In HCC, these transcripts are crucial not only for deepening our molecular understanding but also for advancing clinical outcomes, as they serve as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors by dysregulating essential genes and signaling pathways. Additionally, macrophage polarization is crucial in HCC tumor progression. The study explores the role of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and elucidates the specific molecular mechanisms by which key lncRNAs such as HULC and MALAT1 regulate macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment. These lncRNAs modulate cytokine profiles and influence immune regulators including IL-10 and TGF-β, steering macrophages toward an M2-like, pro-tumor phenotype that fosters aggressive tumor characteristics and progression. Mechanistically, these transcripts interact with epigenetic modifiers like EZH2 to alter histone modifications and chromatin accessibility, while also stabilizing mRNAs that encode inflammatory mediators, thereby reinforcing an immunosuppressive response. The clinical implications of these findings are substantial. The detection of such lncRNAs in patient samples offers a minimally invasive diagnostic avenue, while their pivotal role in complex immune cell behavior positions them as promising prognostic biomarkers. Moreover, targeting these lncRNAs may lead to innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting tumor-supportive inflammatory cascades and restoring an effective antitumor immune response. Understanding the intricate interplay between lncRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation and macrophage polarization not only refines our grasp of HCC progression but also opens new pathways for interventions designed to improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="This study aims to investigate metabolic reprogramming heterogeneity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and identify novel therapeutic targets for HCC treatment. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from public databases were used to analyze the TME of HCC and reveal the characteristics of different cell subsets, including mononuclear phagocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, NK/T cells, B cells, and unknown cells. The analysis revealed that these cell subsets play their own unique roles in tumor progression and immune escape. Analysis of copy number variations (CNVs) was performed on tumor-derived epithelial cells, with the epithelial cells in Cluster 3 subgroup showing the highest CNV levels. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that these cell subsets were involved in a variety of biological processes such as immune response, cell communication, and metabolic pathways, which were consistent with their functional roles. Pseudotemporal analysis further delineated the malignant trajectory of HCC cells, with Cluster 3 exhibiting enhanced phosphatidylinositol metabolism, suggesting a critical role for metabolic reprogramming in tumor invasion and proliferation. Furthermore, a diagnostic model incorporating metabolic reprogramming-associated gene signatures was established, which effectively distinguished HCC from normal tissues. Among these signatures, splicing factor 3a subunit 3 (SF3A3) was identified as both diagnostic and independent prognostic biomarker. Mechanistically, SF3A3 knockdown in HCC cell lines significantly suppressed proliferation, migration, PI3K/AKT signaling, and EMT marker expression, thereby demonstrating its role in driving HCC aggressiveness. In conclusion, these findings elucidate novel molecular characteristics of HCC based on metabolic reprogramming, while establishing SF3A3 as a promising multi-faceted target for HCC diagnosis, prognostic assessment, and therapeutic intervention.">

 Background:
 Epigenetic dysregulation is a key mechanism in cancer biology, driving both immune evasion and the generation of potentially druggable neoantigen targets. Transposable elements (TEs) are proviral sequences mostly found in epigenetically repressed genomic regions. In cancer, TEs are one potential source of neoantigens. The tumor suppressor gene
 ATRX
 is an epigenetic regulator that is lost in up to 30% of soft tissue sarcomas. Loss of function of this heterochromatin modulator leads to widespread alterations to transcription patterns. Our prior work in sarcoma, along with studies in other tumors, showed that ATRX loss leads to the de-repression of TEs. We hypothesize that this mechanism leads to TE neoantigen presentation on MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules.
 Methods:
 Leveraging the gEVE database of proviral sequences with open reading frames, we examined the differential expression of TEs using RNA sequencing of multiple models comparing ATRX lost and ATRX wild-type tumors. Analysis included our previously published data from human undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma cell lines (2 clones, 3 replicates per group; GEO: GSE240030) and a publicly available dataset from a mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma (n = 3 per group; GEO: GSE167537). Additionally, we analyzed analogous data from a mouse model of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), another malignancy with frequent ATRX loss (n = 3 per group; GEO: GSE178113). RNA-seq data was analyzed using Salmon for transcript-to-genome pseudo-alignment, DESeq2 for differential TE expression analysis, and arcasHLA for sample-level MHC-I subtype identification. Differentially overexpressed TEs in ATRX mutant tumors were analyzed for predicted neoantigens using the NetMHCpan4.1 package.
 Results:
 Across multiple models, ATRX loss of function alterations were associated with both activation and repression of TEs. Within two sarcoma contexts, upregulated TEs were found to have protein-coding sequences with the potential to lead to MHC-I neoantigen presentation. Within a human undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma cell line with ATRX loss, there were 7 upregulated TEs shared between the clones, each predicted to contain 12 – 50 MHC-I binding epitopes. Within a mouse soft tissue sarcoma model, 7 TEs were upregulated with ATRX loss, each with 5 – 28 MHC-I binding epitopes. Since ATRX loss alters TE expression in other malignancies, parallel data from a mouse GBM model was additionally analyzed. In this model, 308 TEs were found to be upregulated with ATRX loss, and all were predicted to generate neoantigens. ERVs and LINE1 elements were recurrently identified, making up 97 – 100% of the activated TEs.
 Conclusions:
 Transposable element transcription altered by ATRX loss in sarcoma and GBM creates a predicted source of MHC-I-binding neoantigens. These neoantigens come from TEs of the ERV and LINE1 families.

Results Our thorough analysis reveals that patients with smaller span sizes TDP have a more intricate genome, moderate pathology, enhanced therapeutic response, favorable prognosis, a more active immune system, and higher drug sensitivity. In contrast, those with larger span sizes TDP exhibited opposite trends.

Investigating the nanomechanical and pathophysiological properties of GBM cells will shed light on tumor behavior. In our study, we investigated the mechanical properties, migration dynamics, and cytoskeletal organization of T98G and U87 MG glioblastoma cell lines using in vitro techniques: atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). While U87 MG cells are Temozolomide (TMZ)-sensitive and exhibit increased susceptibility to cell death and growth inhibition, T98 cells exhibit improved survival and repair in response to TMZ therapy. This study found that T98G cells are rougher, stiffer, and more viscous, while U87 MG cells are smoother, more elastic, and less viscous, leading to distinct cellular migration patterns. Such differences indicate GBM cell heterogeneity and have consequences for tumor development and resistance to treatment. The key differences of the nanomechanical, viscoelastic, and migratory properties between T98G and U87 MG cells, demonstrated in this work will help us gauge the diverse effects of different dosages of radiation along with immunotherapeutic agents, identifying the ideal radioimmunotherapy option.">

        <tr id="The breast peritumor microenvironment (pTME) is increasingly recognized as a mediator of breast cancer progression and treatment resistance. However, if and how growth-induced tumor compressive forces (i.e., solid stresses) influence the breast pTME remains unclear. Here we show using instant fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)—a frequency-domain FLIM system capable of simultaneous image acquisition and instantaneous data processing—that breast tumor-mimicking in vitro compression promotes metabolic changes in stromal cells found in the breast pTME. Namely, compression shifts NIH3T3 fibroblasts and differentiated 3T3-L1 (d3T3-L1) adipocytes toward a more glycolytic state, while it promotes increased oxidative phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 undifferentiated adipocytes. The gold-standard Seahorse extracellular flux assay fails to capture these changes, underscoring the superior sensitivity of instant FLIM in detecting metabolic shifts. We validate these phenotypic findings at the transcriptomic level via RNA sequencing, confirming that compressed fibroblasts downregulate oxidative phosphorylation and upregulate glycolysis compared to uncompressed controls. We further demonstrate that compression induces mitochondrial dysregulation in undifferentiated adipocytes, driven in part by upregulated mitophagy and disrupted fusion dynamics. Finally, we confirm that these stromal cell types recapitulate these distinct metabolic states in human breast cancer patient samples, consistent with our in vitro findings. By elucidating mechano-metabolic interactions occurring at the tumor-host interface, these results will inform the development of innovative mechano-metabolic reprogramming treatment strategies to improve breast cancer patient survival.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive form of glioma, remains the most malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Despite a range of therapeutic strategies, the prognosis for GBM patients remains poor, underscoring the urgent need for novel treatments to inhibit GBM progression. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in tumor development, with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) acting as key components. However, the origin, composition, and spatial distribution of CAFs within the GBM microenvironment remain poorly understood. To address this gap, our research aims to investigate the etiology, cellular composition, and precise localization of CAFs in GBM, with the goal of elucidating their role in oncogenesis and tumor progression, thereby providing new avenues for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we developed a novel CAF-related prognostic model using data from the TCGA and GEO databases and identified SERPINH1 and COL5A1 as CAF-related genes in GBM. We established a GBM mouse model as well as a GBM cell and astrocyte co-culture system to examine the expression of SERPINH1 and COL5A1 in astrocytes under a simulated tumor microenvironment. Our findings revealed that these genes were more highly expressed in peritumoral tissue compared to normal brain tissue and showed strong co-localization with astrocytes. Furthermore, we found that normal astrocytes can be induced by GBM cells to activate the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, migrate to the peritumoral region, and upregulate CAF-associated proteins (SERPINH1/COL5A1). These results suggest that astrocytes may serve as a potential source of CAF precursor cells within the GBM tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type glioblastoma, a malignant brain tumour of glial origin, confers a poor prognosis with a median survival of 12 to 16 months from diagnosis. Glioblastomas are aggressive tumours that rapidly proliferate and diffusely infiltrate surrounding brain tissue. Current multimodal standard treatment is typically ineffective and despite gross total surgical resection, tumours recur with more aggressive sub-clonal populations of malignant cells. A defining characteristic of glioblastoma is its highly heterogeneous nature and acquirement of somatic mutations advantageous to tumour growth and suppression of apoptotic pathways. Pathogenesis of malignant brain tumours as well as its mode of transformation to a more aggressive subtype is still largely unknown. Although genomic studies have elucidated a plethora of genetic markers associated with glioblastoma subtypes, only a few have been utilised in a clinical setting. One of the emerging approaches to studying glioblastomas is by investigating how an active proteome contributes to its aggressive nature. Furthermore, through activation of specific pathways via post-translational modifications of proteins such as phosphorylation, glioblastomas create an intricate network of signalling pathways which favour tumour growth and proliferation. Here, we investigated the feasibility of diverse methodological approaches to describe abnormal protein signalling across distinct intra-tumour regions of primary glioblastoma tissue, including proliferative core, peripheral rim, and invasive margin. Whilst we observe a broadly comparable proteome relative to the human non-diseased brain, we identify cytoplasmic proteins α-trypsin, actin, apolipoprotein A1 and transthyretin which may putatively be associated with the GBM infiltrative tumour margin.

        <tr id="Background The PCDH17 family has emerged as a prominent research focus in the field of oncology; however, the precise mechanism underlying the regulatory role of PCDH17 in shaping the inflammatory tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer remains elusive. Method A thorough examination was carried out to explore the presence of PCDH17 in cancerous tumor tissues and its association with genes related to inflammation. Additionally, we comprehensively examined the association between PCDH17 and immune cell infiltration as well as immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer. Moreover, the single-cell data of pancreatic cancer was utilized for analyzing PCDH17 expression, cell differentiation, and intercellular communication. Result PCDH17 exhibited differential expression across various tumor types. The low-expression group of PCDH17 showed reduced levels of inflammatory genes. Immunoinfiltration analysis indicated a significant association between T-cell infiltration and the expression of PCDH17. Analysis of single-cell sequencing data revealed that PCDH17 was primarily expressed in endothelial cells, with a decrease in expression observed during cellular differentiation trajectory. Notably, inflammation-related genes also displayed significant changes in their expression patterns along the endothelial cell differentiation trajectory. Cellular communication investigations unveiled multiple signaling pathways through which endothelial cells interacted with T cells. The presence of PCDH17 in endothelial cells was verified through various immunofluorescence techniques, and a simultaneous decline in its levels was observed alongside the decrease in inflammatory factors within the tumor microenvironment. Conclusion The predominant expression of PCDH17 was observed in endothelial cells, exhibiting a strong association with inflammatory genes and infiltration of immune cells. PCDH17 exhibits potential as a target for regulating the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer.">

Our study demonstrates that the functional restoration of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), a novel tumor suppressor in HGSOC, induces potent tumor-specific cytotoxicity and inverts chemoresistance. Using molecular and preclinical analyses, we showed that full-length and truncated DAPK1 variants efficiently restore apoptotic signaling pathways and significantly enhance platinum-based and taxane treatment sensitivity. Therapeutic efficacy was validated across different model systems, including ovarian cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids. Remarkably, the truncated DAPK1 constructs maintain strong apoptotic activity despite structural modifications, highlighting clinical potential. These findings suggest DAPK1 reactivation as a viable strategy to overcome treatment resistance in HGSOC, with the potential for translation into combination therapy.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive brain tumor with an overall poor prognosis due to its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Microglia and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with pro-tumorigenic properties are dominant populations of immune cells in the glioblastoma TME. To date, several studies targeting TAMs to fight tumor progression in different tumor entities have been initiated. However, the impact of standard therapy schemes of glioblastoma cells on macrophage polarization, activation, and phagocytosis remains controversial. The same applies to the relevance of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in the interaction between macrophages and tumor cells. Our study, therefore, investigated patient-oriented treatment of GLIOBLASTOMA by examining the phagocytic capacity of polarized M1- and M2-like macrophages using GL261-luc2 tumor cells as a preclinical model system. Additionally, we analyzed the expression of activation and immune checkpoint markers on these macrophage subtypes following contact with tumor cells and their microenvironment. These factors were also determined after PD-1 blockade was initiated. The analyses revealed that the immunoregulatory M2-like macrophages generally exhibited a higher phagocytosis rate than the pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages; however, this was not influenced by the pretreatment of glioblastoma cells with chemo- or radiotherapy. This could not be improved by blocking the PD-1 receptor. Furthermore, there were no modulations in the expression of differentiation, activation, or immune checkpoint molecules of M1- and M2-like macrophages after cell-to-cell contact with glioblastoma cells. But the medium conditioned by tumor cells strongly altered M1-like macrophages toward a more activated state, whereas M2-like cells were only mildly influenced. This was further enhanced by tumor cell treatment, with the most prominent effect after irradiation. These results suggest that conventional GLIOBLASTOMA tumor cell treatment affects the immunogenic status of macrophage subtypes, which is relevant for enhancing the anti-tumor immune response in brain tumors.">

 Background:
 Tumor metabolism reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, but metabolite-mediated intercellular communication remains poorly understood. To address this gap, our study employed MEBOCOST, a tool for metabolite abundance estimating and communication events exploring based on single-cell RNA data, to explore the metabolic landscape of tumor microenvironment (TME) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and identify novel metabolite signaling axis.
 Methods:
 The scRNA-seq dataset was subjected to dimensionality reduction using the Seurat package. Cell annotation was manually performed using typical markers from Cell Marker 2.0 and previous studies. Single-cell metabolite abundance and communication events were inferred using MEBOCOST. The TCGA-LUAD datasets was used to estimate and analyze immune cell infiltration levels and tumor hot score using ESTIMATE and ssGSEA algorithms. Additionally, survival analysis was conducted by genes within relative signaling axis. All analysis above in TCGA-LUAD datasets was validated by two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets.
 Results:
 Five landmark metabolites across cell types were identified as prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), D-Mannose, Choline, L-Cysteine, and Cholesterol of TME in LUAD. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) emerged as a key player, primarily produced by fibroblasts and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) by via the

 PTGDS

 gene and by mast cells via the

 HPGDS

 gene. PGD2 signaling was shown to primarily be received by the PGD2 receptor (

 PTGDR

 ) on NK/T cells and transported by the

 SLCO2A1

 transporter on endothelial cells.

 CX3CR1

 + NK/T cells, which are prominent cytotoxic populations, as a PGD2 autocrine signaling axis, are involved in PGD2 autocrine signaling, while KLRC2+ NK, DNAJB1+ NK cells and CD8+ MAIT cells participate in PGD2 paracrine signaling. PGD2 may also assist lactate efflux via

 SLCO2A1

 on endothelial cells. The clinical relevance of the PGD2 signaling axis was validated across multiple bulk RNA datasets, showing that it is associated with the infiltration of above immune cells such as DNAJB1+ NK cells, and linked to better prognosis in LUAD. Furthermore, we found that a risk model developed based on this signaling axis could predict responses to immune therapy in hot and cold tumors, suggesting potential drugs that may benefit low-risk patients.
 Conclusions:
 In this study, we identified PGD2 as a critical metabolite within the LUAD tumor microenvironment, facilitating intercellular communication through its signaling axes. The analysis revealed that PGD2 mediates its tumor-suppressive effects by activating immune cells, particularly NK/T cells, which could be important for modulating anti-tumor immune responses. Our findings also highlight its potential as a biomarker for prognosis and a target for future combination therapies.

        <tr id="Heterogeneity in cancer gene expression is typically linked to genetic and epigenetic alterations, yet post-transcriptional regulation likely influences these patterns as well. However, the quantitative contribution of post-transcriptional mechanisms to cancer transcriptome dynamics remains unclear. Here, we systematically measured mRNA dynamics across diverse breast cancer models, revealing that mRNA stability significantly shapes gene expression variability. To decipher the regulatory grammar underlying these dynamics, we developed GreyHound, an interpretable multimodal deep-learning framework integrating RNA sequence features and RNA-binding protein (RBP) expression. GreyHound identified an extensive network of RBPs and their regulons underlying variations in mRNA stability. Among these, we uncovered a metastasis-suppressive regulatory axis centered on the RNA-binding protein RBMS3 and its post-transcriptional control of the redox regulator TXNIP. Functional and molecular analyses revealed that RBMS3 depletion resulted in targeted transcript destabilization, which was associated with poor clinical outcomes and enhanced metastatic potential in xenograft models. Using in vivo epistasis studies, we confirmed that RBMS3 regulation of TXNIP mRNA stability drives this metastasis-suppressive program. These findings position the RBMS3-TXNIP regulatory axis as a key post-transcriptional mechanism in breast cancer and illustrate how interpretable models of RNA dynamics can uncover hidden regulatory programs in disease.">

        <tr id="Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy is an approved cancer treatment modality, based on non-invasive application of electric fields to the tumor region. Proteomic and cell biology methods revealed a versatile mechanism of action to be involved in the response to TTFields. In the current research we performed whole transcriptome analysis across tumor types to identify pan-cancer responses to TTFields. For this we collected samples from control and TTFields-treated human cancer cell lines of gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, pleural mesothelioma, and glioblastoma. The transcriptomic analysis supported previous reported effects: downregulation of pathways associated with cell cycle, cell growth, and proliferation; downregulation of DNA replication and the FA-BRCA DNA repair pathway; and upregulation of cellular responses to stress—senescence, autophagy, and apoptosis. Notably, previously unrecognized downstream effects of TTFields were revealed on cellular metabolism, with downregulation of protein and RNA metabolism, and upregulation of steroid biosynthesis. Additional DNA repair pathways were also found to be downregulated, including nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. In conclusion, this study revealed similar response patterns to TTFields across different tumor types, re-enforcing some already pinpointed mechanisms, while revealing new mechanisms. Unlocking these new mechanisms may allow identification of potential new cancer treatments for application together with TTFields based on mechanistical compatibility.">

 How does spatial transcriptomic profiling at a single-cell scale reveal the molecular and cellular dynamics of human endometrial regeneration during the proliferative phase?



 High-resolution spatial transcriptomics revealed previously uncharacterized cellular heterogeneity and layer-specific molecular signatures in the proliferative endometrium, including novel peri-glandular and intermediate cell populations.



 Previous studies have revealed non-pregnant endometrium’s temporal transcriptomic patterns during the menstrual cycle through single-cell RNA sequencing. However, a detailed understanding of the cellular heterogeneity in a spatial context, especially in the basalis layer and the composition of the stem cell niche, remains limited.



 A prospective observational study analyzing full-thickness endometrial specimens from nine women undergoing hysterectomy during early (n = 3), mid (n = 3), and late (n = 3) proliferative phase. Samples were analyzed using Visium HD spatial transcriptomics (8μm resolution) integrated with histological examination.



 Full-thickness endometrial samples were obtained from women aged 27-48 years with regular menstrual cycles undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions (Ethical permit: Dnr 2021-05157 and amendment/ Dnr 2022-01635-02). Spatial transcriptomic profiling was performed on tissue sections using the Visium HD platform. Unsupervised clustering, differential gene expression analysis, spatial mapping, and gene ontology analysis were conducted to characterize cell populations and their molecular signatures.



 The study identified distinct molecular signatures in epithelial and mesenchymal lineage in functionalis and basalis layers. A novel intermediate population emerged in the stromal compartment during the mid-proliferative phase, preceding epithelial intermediate populations in the late-proliferative phase. Previously uncharacterized peri-glandular populations were discovered, with 91 and 102 differentially expressed genes in functionalis and basalis respectively during the late-proliferative phase (adjusted p < 0.05). These populations showed enrichment in different biological molecular pathways such as tissue organization, epithelial differentiation, and intermediate filament organization.



 Technical limitations include mechanical damage to the luminal epithelium in some specimens, mixed cell populations within spatial spots, and relatively low sequencing depth per spot compared to single-cell RNA sequencing. Validation through protein-level analyses and integration with single-cell sequencing data may further support the findings.



 This high-resolution spatial atlas of endometrial regeneration provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing tissue renewal and cell-type specification. Identifying specialized cell populations and transitional cell states during endometrial regeneration has important implications for the understanding and development of targeted therapies for endometrial disorders.

        <tr id="We aimed to investigate the genomic and immune microenvironmental characteristics and their prognostic value in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Whole exome sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence analysis were conducted on 38 patients diagnosed with limited-stage SCLC. The two most frequently mutated cancer-related genes observed were RB1 (73.68%) and TP53 (63.16%). However, none of the cancer-related genes, including RB1 and TP53, were associated with prognosis. Furthermore, genomic factors such as tumor mutation burden, copy number instability, and mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity were unrelated to prognosis. Approximately 52.63% (20/38) of cases exhibited PD-L1 expression (combined positive score > 1). The average percentage of CD8-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was 3.27%, with a range spanning from 0.04 to 18.96%. Survival analyses showed that PD-L1 positivity, a high proportion of CD8-positive TILs, and wild-type PI3K pathway were significantly associated with better survival. A predictive prognostic model was further developed based on these three biomarkers, resulting in more accurate stratification of patients according to disease-free survival (DFS, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.020, P < 0.001) and overall survival (OS, HR = 2.344, P < 0.001). Moreover, PD-L1 negative patients who did not undergo adjuvant chemotherapy exhibited significantly improved OS (P = 0.029) and a favorable trend in DFS (P = 0.053) compared to those who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. In conclusion, this study analyzed the genomic and immune microenvironment characteristics of limited-stage SCLC and constructed a prognostic model based on PD-L1 expression, CD8-positive TILs, and PI3K pathway mutation, which may potentially contribute to the clinical management of limited-stage SCLC.

        <tr id="Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is crucial for cancer development and enhances the effectiveness of immunotherapy by triggering an adaptive immune response. However, the impact of ICD-related genes (ICDRGs) on iCCA progression and patient prognosis remains unclear. iCCA samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were categorized into two ICD-associated subtypes by consensus clustering, and patient prognosis in these subgroups was assessed. Single-cell RNA sequencing was conducted on viable cells from 8 iCCA patients to understand their transcriptomic profiles, heterogeneity, and immune microenvironment. Principal component analysis (PCA) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis were applied to identified 13 cell subpopulations. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate pathway heterogeneity among these subpopulations. CellChat was employed for intercellular communication analysis. Pseudotime trajectory analyses with CytoTRACE and Monocle2 were used to explore differentiation trajectories and functional differences across various states. 30,485 single cells from human iCCA and normal tissues were sequenced, revealing two ICD-associated subtypes. The ICD-low subtype correlates with better clinical outcomes, whereas the ICD-high subtype is linked to increased immune cell infiltration and immune response signaling activity. Distinct biological functions and metabolic characteristics were observed in iCCA between high- and low-ICD groups. High infiltration of ICD-low subtype in iCCA is associated with poor prognosis, potentially through the ANXA-FPR pathway affecting macrophage proliferation and differentiation. Our study constructed an immunogenic cell death-related signature that can promise prognosis prediction and personalized medicine in iCCA. This finding might help guide clinicians for iCCA patients.

        <tr id="Cellular plasticity in mammary epithelial cells enables dynamic cell state changes essential for normal development but can be hijacked by breast cancer cells to drive tumor progression. However, the molecular factors that maintain cellular plasticity through the regulation of a hybrid cell state (epithelial/mesenchymal) are not fully defined. As LMO2 has been previously shown to regulate metastasis, here we determined the role of LMO2 in the normal mammary epithelial cells. Using lineage tracing and knockout mouse models we find that Lmo2 lineage-traced cells persist long-term in the mammary gland, both in the luminal and basal layer but have limited proliferative potential. Lmo2 loss does not impact mammary gland development, but acute deletion decreases in vivo reconstitution. Moreover, LMO2 knockdown in mouse and human mammary epithelial cells (MECs) reduces organoid formation. We find that LMO2 maintains a hybrid cell state in MECs and LMO2 knockdown promotes mesenchymal differentiation. Transcriptional profiling of LMO2 knockdown cells reveals significant enrichment in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway and upregulation of MCAM, a negative regulator of regenerative capacity in the mammary gland. Altogether, we show that LMO2 plays a role in maintaining cellular plasticity in MECs, adding insight into the normal differentiation programs hijacked by cancer cells to drive tumor progression.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers, with an average survival time of only six months following diagnosis, even with currently available therapies. Thus, PDAC represents a significant therapeutic challenge, necessitating a deeper understanding of its biology and tumor microenvironment (TME) to develop more effective treatments and improve patient outcomes. Here, we report that the expression of Eukaryotic Elongation Factor-2 Kinase (eEF2K) is associated with shorter patient survival and demonstrate that eEF2K signaling is critical for the PDAC tumor growth and regulated by the TME. Furthermore, in vivo targeted genetic inhibition of eEF2K suppressed tumor growth in two different PDAC mouse models, reduced tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and induced marked apoptosis in tumor tissues without any signs of toxicity. Our data suggest that eEF2K knockdown diminishes the activity of the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase and reduces the expression of macrophage-derived factors, such as Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP1), along with the Gas6/AXL signaling pathway in PDAC cells. Additionally, analysis of the NCI-TCGA PDAC patient database further showed that eEF2K expression, in the presence of TAM markers, correlates with even shorter patient survival. TAM-released factors, such as MCP1, Gas6, and exosomes, induce eEF2K expression in PDAC cells, as well as the activity of AXL, SRC, VEGF, Snail, and MMP2, contributing to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. In conclusion, our findings reveal for the first time that eEF2K is a critical oncogenic driver of PDAC tumor growth and thus targeting eEF2K represents a promising and novel therapeutic strategy for PDAC.">

        <tr id="Melanoma is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive malignancy. Hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment is closely associated with tumor progression. However, the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α), a key transcription factor, in melanoma remains poorly understood. In this study, transcriptome analysis compared HIF2α expression between melanoma patient and control samples. Single-cell RNA sequencing categorized cells into high- and low-HIF2α expression groups. Ligand–receptor interactions (CellChat), enrichment analysis (GSEA/GSVA), immune regulatory network, and metabolic pathway analyses were performed. The correlation between HIF2α and genes involved in hypoxia, autophagy, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) was explored, alongside its relationship with clinical stage. Experimentally, A375 cells were cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, transfected with ShRNA-NC or ShRNA-HIF2α, and mRNA levels of HIF2α, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin were quantified using real-time PCR. Differential expression analysis showed significant upregulation of HIF2α in melanoma samples. Ligand–receptor interaction analysis emphasized its role in modulating the tumor microenvironment. Enrichment analyses (GSEA/GSVA) revealed HIF2α involvement in key oncogenic pathways. Correlation analysis linked HIF2α to genes related to hypoxia, autophagy, and EMT, and its expression was associated with advanced clinical stages. In vitro, hypoxia increased HIF-2α, N-cadherin, and Vimentin mRNA levels, while decreasing E-cadherin. HIF-2α knockdown reversed these effects, promoting E-cadherin and suppressing N-cadherin and Vimentin under hypoxia. This study underscores the critical role of HIF2α in melanoma progression, suggesting its involvement in regulating the tumor microenvironment and associated metabolic pathways. As a potential biomarker and therapeutic target, HIF2α offers new insights into the clinical management and treatment of melanoma.

 Sex differences in breast cancer (BC) lead to distinct clinical and molecular characteristics. Sex-associated heterogeneity relies intricately on the oncogenic properties of cancer cells and multicellular interactions in tumor microenvironments. Here we conducted a multiomic analysis encompassing single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and large-scale histological analysis, combined with genetic and pharmacological perturbations to systematically develop a high-resolution and spatially resolved map of intratumoral expression heterogeneity in male breast cancer (MBC). Among the malignant cells, we identify 9 consensus meta-programs (MPs, for example, estrogen response and interferon response), each consisting of dozens of genes that are coordinately upregulated in subpopulations of cells within MBC. Of these, MP5 exhibits significant male bias, characterized by aberrant activation of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling pathway, inducing endocrine therapy resistance in MBC. Bidirectional interactions between MP5 malignant cells and immunosuppressive cancer-associated fibroblasts form an immune exclusionary microenvironment mediated by LRBA. Collectively, our study highlights the endocrine therapy resistant and immunosuppressive role of LRBA in MBC, and these findings may provide insights into the molecular features of MBC and facilitate the development of sex-specifical treatment strategies.
