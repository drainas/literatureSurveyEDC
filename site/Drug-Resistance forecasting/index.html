        <tr id="DHFR gene amplification is commonly present in methotrexate (MTX)-resistant colon cancer cells and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, we proposed an integrative framework to characterize the amplified region by using a combination of single-molecule real-time sequencing, next-generation optical mapping, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C). We identified an amplification unit spanning 11 genes, from the DHFR gene to the ATP6AP1L gene position, with high adjusted interaction frequencies on chromosome 5 (~2.2 Mbp) and a twenty-fold tandemly amplified region, and novel inversions at the start and end positions of the amplified region as well as frameshift insertions in most of the MSH and MLH genes were detected. These mutations might stimulate chromosomal breakage and cause the dysregulation of mismatch repair. Characterizing the tandem gene-amplified unit may be critical for identifying the mechanisms that trigger genomic rearrangements. These findings may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the amplification process and the evolution of drug resistance. Sequencing a large region of DNA containing many surplus copies of genes linked to drug resistance in colon cancer cells may illuminate how these genomic rearrangements arise. Such regions of gene amplification are highly repetitive, making them impossible to sequence using ordinary methods, and little is known about how they are generated. Using advanced methods, Jeong-Sun Seo at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital in South Korea and co-workers sequenced a region of gene amplification in colon cancer cells. The amplified region was approximately 20 times the length of that in healthy cells and contained many copies of an eleven-gene segment, including a gene implicated in drug resistance. The region also contained mutations in chromosomal repair genes which would disrupt repair pathways. These results illuminate the genetic changes that lead to gene amplification and drug resistance in cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Cancers develop and evolve by overcoming numerous selective pressures including cell-intrinsic growth-inhibitory mechanisms, microenvironmental stresses, and therapeutic interventions. In addition to mutational mechanisms, cancer cell adaptation via transcriptional plasticity remains an important but poorly understood driver of cancer cell fitness. Specifically, when disease progression occurs after targeted therapy treatment, genomically-defined mechanisms of resistance are only identified in approximately 50% of patients, suggesting that non-genomic mechanisms play an equally important role. Thus, there is a pressing need to devise systematic and scalable methods to determine essential drivers of prognostically-relevant cancer cell states, and to engineer state-relevant models that can be applied to discover new therapeutic approaches that overcome these modes of resistance. Here, we present a strategy to systematically identify transcriptional drivers of inflammation- and therapy-resistant cancer cell states. We have successfully established a high-throughput screening pipeline to 1) over-express human transcription factor (TF) isoforms in a pooled format within cancer models; 2) perform positive-selection screens under a variety of selective pressures to define transcriptional mechanisms of inflammation tolerance and therapy resistance; 3) perform single-cell RNA sequencing to define families of TFs that drive specific cell state transitions and resistance phenotypes; and 4) conduct mechanistic studies to examine the downstream signaling networks that facilitate cancer cell growth in the setting of these selective pressures. We uncover TFs and states that drive resistance in a tissue- and perturbation-specific manner, as well as states that are robust to multiple different selective pressures. A subset of TFs and associated gene programs induce tolerance to chronic interferon exposure in our screens and are reflected in vivo in the setting of immunotherapy resistance. We also identify distinct TF families that drive resistance to pharmacologic KRAS inhibition. Notably, cancer cell states that confer resistance to KRAS inhibition also exhibit cross-resistance to other MAPK pathway inhibitors, suggesting that cell state adaption may contribute to multi-drug resistance as cancers progress. More broadly, our strategy enables the systematic identification and mapping of cell states that drive cancer cell fitness to in vivo clinical atlas datasets, providing a framework for interpretation of clinical phenotypes and potential predictive modeling of cell state evolution. Furthermore, the cell state-defined models developed here provide a substrate for new therapeutic discovery using cancer cell states as biomarkers, a key next step to developing combination strategies that overcome therapeutic resistance and improve outcomes for patients.

        <tr id="
 In oncology, patients treated with targeted therapies often have strong and durable responses early in treatment; however, the development of resistance hinders long-term therapeutic benefit. A subset of tumor cells can develop resistance, often from both genetic and non-genetic mechanisms through gradual, multi-step resistance. Nonetheless, predicting which cells will evolve to become resistant, and strategies to suppress adaptability contributing to resistance remain unknown. While resistance may emerge in cells harboring driver mutations, the adaptation process necessitates substantial modifications to the phenotype facilitated by cellular plasticity. Therefore, plasticity serves as a crucial facilitator of resistance by enhancing adaptability, rather than functioning as a direct cause of resistance. We hypothesize that the direct selection for therapy resistance leads to indirect selection for enhanced plasticity. We propose that as treatment selects for drug-resistant phenotypes, concurrent selection for cells exhibiting greater adaptability occurs. Thus, enhanced plasticity is indirectly favored during selection for drug resistance. We have found strong support for this hypothesis through in silico modeling, with subsequent validation through functional assays. In our functional assays, we utilize the H3122 cell line derived from a patient with ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to model targeted therapy resistance. This well-studied model effectively mimics the initial responsiveness and subsequent resistance observed in clinical settings. Utilizing single-cell sorting and the expansion of clonal isolates from the parental H3122 population, we identified heterogeneity in the ability to adapt where subgroups exhibited a range of high adaptation potential (HAP) to low adaptation potential (LAP) based on their response to numerous independent stressors, including targeted ALK inhibitors. We have found that therapeutic stressors lead to selection of subpopulations with higher adaptability potential, enriching for a more lethal subgroup than the original tumor. HAP cells display increased multi-drug resistance and metastatic potential compared to LAP cells. HAP cells are significantly enriched in plasticity-related pathways overlapping with those found in cells that have developed strong resistance to ALK inhibitors. In subcutaneous tumor models, LAP cells show a 1, 000-fold reduction in tumor burden, while HAP cells develop resistance. Our findings suggest that disrupting cellular adaptability can prevent resistance, maintaining cells in a therapy-sensitive state. This approach shifts the focus from killing tumor cells to blocking their ability to adapt, opening up a novel angle for overcoming resistance. Addressing adaptability reveals intervention points that conventional strategies might overlook, offering new, proactive strategies in cancer treatment.

        <tr id="Cancer cells that survive therapeutic drug pressure are a significant cause of disease relapse and progression, impeding curative cancer treatment. Drug-triggered Darwinian selection and the emergence of subclones harbouring specific mutations that confer resistance have been well documented and extensively studied. However, these genetic alterations, while important, do not fully explain clinical observations where some patients, after a drug holiday, regain sensitivity to the same treatment despite previous disease progression. This phenomenon highlights the possibility that drug resistance may not solely rely on genetic mutations but could also involve reversible, non-genetic mechanisms. Recent studies have highlighted the existence of drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs), a subpopulation of cancer cells that can survive short-term therapeutic pressure without acquiring resistance-associated genetic alterations. These cells exhibit a temporary yet reversible tolerance to the initial treatment while also acquiring cross-tolerance to other anti-cancer therapies. The presence of DTPs underscores a dynamic and complex plasticity in tumours, wherein cancer cells can utilise epigenetic rewiring, metabolic reprogramming, and specific signalling pathways to transit between drug-tolerant and drug-sensitive states to adapt to environmental pressures. Furthermore, this adaptive resilience enables DTPs to act as a reservoir for the development of genetically stable resistance, resulting in cancer therapy failure and eventual relapse. In this mini-review, we examine recent evidence on DTPs to provide an overview of their characteristics, development, and survival mechanisms.">

        <tr id="The advent of single-cell RNA-seq has permitted a global view of the transcriptomic variation across cancer cells in individual tumors and revealed functionally-related sets of genes - a gene module - underpin a cancer cell state. While single-cell transcriptomic atlases have provided a descriptive characterization of cancer cell states across tumor types, we lack a mechanistic framework on the constraints of tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, we propose a ‘developmental constraint’ model - where cancer cell state transitions are restricted by the organism’s developmental map, wherein from the cell-of-origin the malignant cells traverse states that are accessible by its developmental trajectory, both toward progenitor-like states and differentiated-like states of adjacent lineages. Our model posits a constraint on the emergence of states, even under evolutionary pressures such as therapeutic intervention. To test this framework, we modeled non-genetic mechanisms of acquired resistance to KRAS inhibitors - histological adeno-to-squamous transition (AST). Multi-omic analysis of 68 patients enrolled in the KRYSTAL-1 clinical trial revealed a squamous gene signature correlated with a poor response specifically in patients with co-occurring KRASG12C;STK11 (KCL) mutations. We recapitulated AST upon resistance to KRASG12C inhibition in KCL genetically engineered mouse models and tumor-derived organoids. Single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic of tumor-derived organoid revealed that AST is mediated by a two-step transition - from adeno-like states to an intermediate highly plastic cell state expressing markers of mixed-identity to enriched for squamous-like states. These findings support the developmental constraint model where cell state transitions are mediated by progenitor states in contrast to a trans-differentiation model. Furthermore, we hypothesized that cancer cell state transitions are restricted by the cell’s chromatin context and specific chromatin modifiers are required for cell state transitions analogous to development. Therefore, we leveraged a time-course Perturb-seq approach against 191 chromatin modifiers to identify functional requirements for the adeno-to-intermediate and intermediate-to-squamous transition. Using a module-based method, we found cells with perturbations of the SWI/SNF complex (Arid1a, Smarca4 and Smarce1) did not transition to the squamous cell state but were restricted to the intermediate highly plastic cell state, suggesting that the SWI/SNF complex is required for the intermediate-to-squamous transition. Together, we have showed evidence that cell state transitions in cancer may be explained by the developmental constraint model and revealed that these constraints may act at the chromatin level where chromatin modifiers and chromatin states enable AST plasticity during adaptation to KRAS inhibitors.

 Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a breast cancer subtype that manifests fast disease progression and very poor overall survival. Despite initial response to standard of care, development of therapy resistance remains the major challenge in TNBC clinical management. Delineating the mechanisms underlying resistance development has been impeded by the still unknown cell population of origin and lack of longitudinal molecular profiling. To investigate this question, we applied a CRISPR based lineage tracing system into TNBC cell lines. Longitudinal samples from an Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC), Sacituzumab Govitican sensitive to resistance were collected in vitro via stepwise drug dose escalation and in vivo via xnenograft serial transplantation. We leveraged cellular barcoding with single cell multiome from 10X genomics to simultaneously capture clonal identity, accessible chromatin and gene expression and hence, directly linked lineage with functional cell states. Preliminary results suggest that TNBC cells adopted distinct cell states shortly after drug exposure with characteristics including upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, stemness markers and downregulation of immune related pathways. Clonal level analysis revealed only a subset of clones survived initial treatment and are enriched in specific “primed” cell states. Next, we will construct single cell lineage trees and quantify clonal dynamics and cell state transition rates. We will identify and validate regulators of cellular plasticity and explore if potential drug combinations will prevent emergence of resistance cell state. Overall, this study will build a comprehensive map of the phenotypic trajectory towards chemotherapy resistance and pinpoints biomarkers of therapy response in triple negative breast cancer.

 KRAS G12C inhibitors (G12Ci), including the FDA-approved Sotorasib and Adagrasib, represent a significant advancement in targeted cancer therapies. As their use in non-small cell lung cancer patients expands, addressing the pervasive challenge of drug resistance is critical. Resistance mechanisms can be innate, acquired, or both, often coexisting within complex scenarios. Recent studies have highlighted various resistance mechanisms to G12Ci, such as oncogene amplification, activation of alternative signaling pathways, additional mutations in KRAS or its associated networks, and adaptive processes like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Identifying the primary drivers and predominant mechanisms of resistance is crucial for developing effective countermeasures. To tackle these challenges, we developed Oligo-CALL, an innovative cellular barcoding technology that employs antisense oligonucleotide-inducible CRISPRa for lineage labeling. This technique allows for precise clonal tracking and the retrospective isolation of clones. Using Oligo-CALL, we analyzed tumor clonal heterogeneity and traced the evolution of resistance in lung cancer cells treated with G12Ci. Treatment with Sotorasib resulted in reduced clonal diversity, indicative of strong selective pressure. Similar clonal compositions across different replicates suggest that intrinsic mechanisms significantly contribute to G12Ci resistance. Notably, about 30% of resistant clones showed increased expression of the Kras G12C allele, primarily due to genomic gains, pointing to chromosomal instability (CIN) as a key factor in resistance development. Comprehensive analyses including fluorescent karyotyping, whole-genome, and transcriptome sequencing of isolated tumor clone pairs, revealed extensive genomic complexity and increased heterogeneity under G12Ci treatment. Resistant clones exhibited specific increases in copy number variations, chromosomal structure variations, and additional single nucleotide mutations, further underscoring CIN as a driving force behind G12Ci resistance. Clones that underwent drug treatment displayed higher CIN scores compared to their treatment-naïve counterparts. Intriguingly, cells resistant to G12Ci demonstrated increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, suggesting that targeting DNA repair pathways could induce synthetic lethality, offering a potential strategy to overcome resistance in lung cancer cells.

 Drug resistance in cancer therapy remains a significant challenge, driven by the ability of cancer cells to evade treatment through complex epigenetic adaptations. Identifying distinct molecular and structural signatures in drug-resistant cells is crucial for uncovering predictive biomarkers and understanding the mechanisms underlying resistance. In this study, we combine highly multiplexed fluorescence imaging and label-free quantitative phase imaging technologies with genomic analyses to investigate the morphological and molecular alterations associated with drug resistance. Using the colon cancer cell line SW480, we developed a drug-resistant phenotype by gradually increasing concentration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Our approach includes morphological analysis, profiling 26 proteins and chromatin modifications, and transcriptomic evaluation. Genomic analyses—including CUT&RUN, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq—further characterize histone modifications, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility in drug-resistant and parental cells. Our analysis reveals distinct morphological features in drug-resistant (DR) cells compared to their parental counterparts, such as increased morphological plasticity, an elongated shape and pronounced protrusions characteristic of cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A deep neural network analysis of these morphological features effectively distinguishes drug-resistant cells from parental cells, achieving a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.95. Biomarker expression analysis identifies significant changes in protein expression in drug-resistant cells, notably H3K27me3, H3K27ac, CD44, and EZH2, indicating substantial epigenetic reprogramming and increased stemness. Gene ontology analysis highlights the upregulation of Wnt and EMT pathways, alongside the downregulation of cell adhesion and tight junction pathways, reflecting enhanced invasiveness in drug-resistant cells. Additionally, ATAC-seq analysis reveals a more compact chromatin landscape in drug-resistant cells, consistent with epigenetic modifications that drive transcriptional repression of specific pathways. In conclusion, our multiscale high-content imaging platform proves to be a powerful tool for uncovering the morphological and molecular characteristics of drug-resistant cancer cells. We demonstrate that drug-resistant cells adopt mesenchymal-like morphology, coupled with significant epigenetic reprogramming, chromatin compaction, and enhanced stemness. These results underscore the interplay between morphological adaptations and epigenetic alterations in the development of drug resistance. Our study provides critical insights into the mechanisms driving resistance and lays the groundwork for identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

 Resistance to cancer treatment remains a significant obstacle in curing cancer patients. Despite recent advancements in novel cancer drugs, patients often experience treatment resistance even after initially responding to therapy, leading to tumor relapse. To understand how resistance develops against standard cancer therapies, it is essential to study the gradual changes leading to full resistance. Recent research shows that cancer cells can evade the effects of chemotherapy and targeted therapies by entering a reversible, slow-growing phase called the drug-tolerant persister (DTP) state. In this DTP state, cancer cells survive drug treatment long enough to begin accumulating mutations and eventually develop additional mechanisms of irreversible resistance. Patient-derived organoid (PDO) models, also known as HUB Organoids®, are directly derived from patient tissues, making them more physiologically relevant than traditional cell lines. This study highlights the value of PDO models in studying drug persistence and resistance, as they are more likely to reflect in-vivo conditions. Here, we demonstrate the successful development of colorectal cancer (CRC) PDO models that can persist and resist standard therapies. These models were characterized using whole exome sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing to assess their persistent or resistant state and to identify potential pathways and new drug targets involved in resistance. In conclusion, developing persistent and resistant PDO models is essential for understanding the mechanisms behind drug resistance. This research contributes to developing patient-relevant preclinical models to develop more effective and personalized cancer treatments and expands our overall understanding of how resistance develops in cancer patients.

        <tr id="Chemotherapy remains a prevalent strategy in cancer therapy; however, the emergence of drug resistance poses a considerable challenge to its efficacy. Most drug resistance arises from the accumulation of genetic mutations in a minority of resistant cells. The mechanisms underlying the emergence and progression of cancer resistance from these minority-resistant cells (MRCs) remain poorly understood. This study employs force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (FIRMS) alongside various biological investigations to reveal the mechanical pathways for MRCs fostering drug resistance and tumor progression. The findings show that minority Paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells have enhanced mechanical properties. These cells can transmit high-intensity forces to surrounding sensitive cells (SCs) through the force transducer, Merlin. This force transmission facilitates the assimilation of surrounding SCs, subsequently strengthening the contraction and adhesion of tumor cells. This process is termed "mechano-assimilation," which accelerates the development of drug resistance and tumor progression. Interestingly, disturbances and reductions of mechano-assimilation within tumors can restore sensitivity to Paclitaxel both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides preliminary evidence highlighting the contribution of MRCs to the development of drug resistance and malignancy, mediated through mechanical interactions. It also establishes a foundation for future research focused on integrating mechanical factors into innovative cancer therapies.">

 Melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, presents a significant clinical challenge. The identification of BRAFV600E mutations as a driver in roughly half of all melanoma cases has led to the development of targeted therapies, exemplified by Vemurafenib (Vem), which inhibits overactivated MAPK signaling. However, frequent relapses remain a major obstacle. To investigate the complex mechanisms driving drug resistance in melanoma, we developed PerturbFate, a scalable single-cell combinatorial-indexing strategy that integrates multi-modal profiling with CRISPR perturbations. This approach simultaneously captures newly synthesized and pre-existing transcriptomes, chromatin accessibility, and CRISPR sgRNA identity from individual cells. Using this platform, we profiled BRAFV600E melanoma cells (A375) after knocking down each of 143 potential drug resistance candidate genes, both with and without Vem treatment, in a pooled manner. We identified extensive phenotypic state transitions in melanoma cells under genetic and chemical perturbations, revealing that an undifferentiated state is associated with enhanced drug resistance, while a more benign, Vem-responsive melanocytic state exists at the opposite end of the phenotypic spectrum. Temporal gene regulatory network analyses revealed that AP-1 transcription factors (TFs), particularly FOSL1, pioneer other diverse TFs to drive the melanoma dedifferentiation. In contrast, SOX10 is the key determinant of the melanocytic state. We identified MAPK pathway, which primarily promotes proliferation, and Hippo/YAP signaling, which predominantly drives the undifferentiated state transition, as convergent key pathways mediating drug resistance. Their synergistic interplay, executed through the collaborative activation of downstream TFs (e.g., FOSL1, RREB1, SMADs, KLF5)-mediated gene expression, is a critical driver of Vem resistance. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observation that perturbation of genes encoding the Mediator Complex components (e.g., MED12, CCNC, MED13, MED19, MED15, MED24) induced autonomous dedifferentiation and/or resistance to Vem in melanoma, we established linkages between their distinct biochemical properties and heterogeneous perturbation responses. We also identified the convergence of dysregulated inflammation, potentially mediated by VEGFC and interleukins (ILs), with Hippo/YAP-mediated transcriptional responses in driving melanoma dedifferentiation and Vem resistance following perturbation of mediator complex genes. Altogether, our study introduces a novel single-cell multi-modal CRISPR perturbation platform, which we applied to comprehensively chart the responses of melanoma cells to the perturbation of all potential Vem resistance candidate genes. These findings pave the way for the identification of precise targets for combination therapies with enhanced efficacy against melanoma drug resistance.

        <tr id="Karyotyping, SNP arrays, fluorescence in situ hybridisation and next generation sequencing techniques have greatly improved our understanding of the genetic drivers of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the past years, another layer of genetic data has been added by the study of mutational signatures, patterns of somatic mutations that represent specific mutational mechanisms. Mutational signatures can give insight in tumor development, but also reveal mutagenic side-effects of treatment in relapse samples. Multiple treatment-related mutational signatures have been detected in relapsed ALL that could play a role in therapy resistance and relapse development. In fact, multiple pathogenic driver mutations have been attributed to these treatment-related mutational processes, including a recurrent TP53 mutation. Studies in childhood ALL revealed that thiopurine exposure is the most common source of therapy-related mutagenicity in ALL and presents differently when patients are DNA mismatch repair deficient. Thiopurine-induced DNA damage indicates that leukemic cells were able to survive thiopurine exposure. This could be due to metabolic defects, acquired mutations that induce thiopurine resistance during treatment or resistance to drugs synergizing with thiopurines. In this review, we discuss the types and prevalence of treatment-related mutational signatures in ALL, and explore mechanisms of thiopurine cytotoxicity and mutagenicity.">

 Resistance to EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a major barrier to effective treatment. Tumor adaptation frequently involves dynamic cellular state transitions, altered signaling networks, and interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Understanding the mechanisms driving resistance in EGFR- and ALK-mutant tumors is critical to developing strategies to improve patient outcomes. This study investigates transcriptomic changes underlying TKI resistance and persistance, combining patient data with functional insights from PDX models. Tumor biopsies from 11 LUAD patients were collected across three treatment stages: baseline (n=6), minimal residual disease (MRD, n=4), and relapse (n=1). Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were generated from pretreated tumors with EGFR and ALK mutations. Tumors were grafted into five mice per model, with three receiving treatment until stable residual disease emerged and two serving as untreated controls. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed on both patient tumor samples and PDX models to comprehensively profile transcriptomic changes. Transcriptomic changes were observed in both patient tumor samples and PDX models during TKI treatment. In patients, at MRD, a novel subpopulation expressing mesenchymal and neuronal markers was identified, accompanied by altered cell-cell communication involving neuronal signaling (RELN), stromal remodeling (FGFRs), and survival pathways (MAPK). At relapse, signatures of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), ECM remodeling, and immune evasion were enriched. In PDX models, most persister cells were arrested in the G1 phase and showed suppression of canonical cancer pathways, while notable upregulation of the ciliated pathway was observed across models. This study provides a high-resolution transcriptomic map of TKI-treated LUAD tumors. Resistance mechanisms in EGFR- and ALK-mutant tumors include neuronal, EMT, MAPK signaling, ECM remodeling, and activation of the ciliated pathway. These findings offer novel therapeutic targets to combat resistance, leveraging the integration of patient-derived data and functional insights from PDX models.

 Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive form of B-cell lymphoma that is characterized by aberrations in B-cell receptor signaling and BCL-2-mediated apoptotic pathways. MCLs treated with inhibitors of either have shown remarkable response rates but ultimately develop drug resistance, with patients suffering from rapid disease progression and experiencing poor clinical outcomes. Preclinical and clinical studies into the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib and the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 (venetoclax) revealed that they were synergistic when combined against MCL and showed significant clinical efficacy, respectively. However, through an unclear mechanism, many cases of MCL similarly developed resistance to combination therapy. To elucidate the mechanisms by which MCL develops drug resistance, we induced resistance to BTKi-venetoclax in 2 patient-derived MCL cell lines, Mino and Rec1, and characterized transcriptional and epigenetic changes using bulk and single-cell RNA and ATAC-seq datasets. We conducted differential expression and accessibility analysis between BTKi-venetoclax-sensitive and resistant samples and identified significantly enriched pathways to find molecular processes that differentiate the two. We show that resistant MCL displays changes at the chromatin and RNA level associated with BCL-2 inhibition, including downregulation of E2F and E2F targets such as cyclin D1. However, we observe that both MCL lines that developed resistance to BTKi-venetoclax upregulate BCL-XL to evade BCL-2 inhibition-mediated apoptosis, likely through activation of the alternative JAK/STAT, interferon, NFKB, and Myc pathways, which are also significantly upregulated. These drastic transcriptomic changes provide an explanation of how resistant MCLs bypass both BCL-2 and BCR-signaling inhibition, leading to survival and neoplastic expansion. Additionally, we identify upregulated genes on both a transcriptional and epigenetic level that encode surface proteins that may inform future targeted therapies. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the transcriptomic reprogramming undertaken by mantle cell lymphoma when developing resistance to BTKi-venetoclax and identify potential vulnerabilities conferred by dual-therapy resistance. They suggest that future therapies optimized against MCL require a combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapies designed to counteract transcriptome reprogramming seen during drug resistance.

        <tr id="Background: Cisplatin resistance is a major cause of tumor recurrence and mortality in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) has emerged as a critical factor in tumor evolution and drug resistance. However, the specific contribution of eccDNA to cisplatin resistance in HGSOC remains unclear. Methods: We performed whole-genome sequencing, Circle-Seq, and RNA-Seq in four pairs of primary and cisplatin-resistant (cisR) HGSOC cell lines to characterize genome-wide eccDNA distribution and features. Functional enrichment analyses were subsequently conducted on differentially expressed eccDNA-related genes. Results: In the SKOV3 cisR cell line, we identified a large extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA) carrying the HIF1A gene, which regulates DNA repair, drug efflux, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition, contributing to cisplatin resistance. Using Circle-Seq, we detected a total of 161,062 eccDNAs, most of which were less than 1000 bp and distributed across all chromosomes. Notably, the number of eccDNAs on chromosome 21 differed significantly between the primary and cisR cell lines. Additionally, eccDNAs were predominantly located in non-coding repetitive elements. Functional analysis of eccDNA-related differentially expressed genes revealed that, compared to primary cell lines, cisR cell lines were associated with mitotic spindle assembly, regulation of vascular permeability, and cell differentiation. eccDNA-related genes involved in these pathways include MISP, WIPF1, RHOD, KRT80, and PLVAP. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that eccDNAs, particularly ecDNA amplifications like HIF1A, contribute significantly to cisplatin resistance mechanisms in HGSOC. These insights highlight eccDNA as a potential target for overcoming therapeutic resistance and improving treatment outcomes in ovarian cancer.">

 Chemotherapy resistance is a major contributor of cancer-related deaths. Resistance can either be acquired during treatments or pre-exist at the time of the diagnosis. Previous studies on high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) have shown contradictory findings on the role of genetic causes explaining emergence of chemotherapy resistance at relapses, for example selection of resistant clones during chemotherapy. HGSC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, showing multiple genetically heterogeneous clones present before therapeutic intervention. While most patients respond well to primary therapy, cancer relapses within few years, leading to treatment resistance. To understand genetic impact on emergence of resistance, we used matched pretreatment and treated samples from 214 unselected HGSC patients collected at DECIDER trial (NCT04846933). We constructed phylogenetic trees based on whole-genome sequencing of 804 tumor samples and whole-exome sequencing of 63 circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) samples from plasma. Cancer evolution analysis identified patients with and without selection during treatments: patients with remained heterogeneity with stalled evolution, and others dominated by subclones originating from single resistant clone. Patients with better primary therapy outcome were linked to re-expansion of a single major clone at relapse, while multiple ancestral clones founded relapse populations in poorer outcome patients. The single-clone expansion pattern also emerged in later relapses, after multiple lines of therapy. Majority of the relapsed cancers evolved further from the ancestral clones already present at pretreatment. The relapse emerging subclonal mutations affected pathways such as carbohydrate metabolism and cAMP signaling. In contrast, sensitive clones eliminated by treatment carried mutations affecting extracellular matrix and NTRK3 signaling. Interestingly, some cancers did not acquire new mutations at relapse, despite becoming chemoresistant, suggesting that non-genetic mechanisms, such as phenotypic plasticity or microenvironmental factors, might underlie their resistance. In summary, we discovered heterogeneous cancer evolution trajectories during treatment which were linked to mutations in key pathways and prior therapy responses. While chemotherapy often selects persistent cancer subclones that seed later relapses, some patients acquire resistance through non-genetic mechanisms, highlighting the complexity of cancer evolution and resistance dynamics. Understanding these dynamics is crucial to define better therapeutic interventions in these poor prognosis patients with advanced HGSC.

        <tr id="Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a promising oncolytic agent with a non-segmented, negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of approximately 15 kb. While NDV selectively replicates in and lyses a wide range of human cancer cells, a subset of these cells develop persistent infections, potentially compromising the therapeutic efficacy of NDV-based treatments. To investigate the molecular basis of persistent infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of TCCSUP bladder cancer cells persistently infected with the NDV AF2240 strain. Deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 was conducted in triplicate, and the resulting viral and host reads were separated and analyzed. Using Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV) software, we identified several nucleotide variants linked to persistence. Specifically, nucleotide alterations included a deletion at 359A→C and a substitution at 1653C→T within the nucleoprotein (NP) gene, as well as an insertion at 3338C→T in the matrix protein (M) gene. Additionally, a GGG base insertion was detected at position 2290 in the phosphoprotein (P) gene. Crucially, we observed truncations in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene (nt 8263–8390) and the large polymerase (L) gene (nt 6203–6342). These mutations and truncations suggest significant disruptions in viral replication, assembly, and host cell attachment, potentially facilitating viral persistence in bladder cancer cells. Understanding these genomic alterations provides valuable insights into the mechanisms driving viral persistence and could inform strategies to optimize the oncolytic efficacy of NDV in cancer therapy.">

In this new paradigm, genomic and cytogenetic events unlock epigenetic plasticity, reshaping MM cell biology to evade tumor microenvironment constraints and therapeutic pressure. These conclusions are derived from a newly assembled cohort of nearly 1,000 patients, spanning premalignant to late-stage refractory MM, comprehensively characterized at molecular and clinical levels. Our findings provide a unifying framework to explain inter-patient genomic heterogeneity and the emergence of therapy resistance in sequential samples without new genomic alterations. In conclusion, we propose targeting epigenetic plasticity-mediated plasma cell evasion as a promising therapeutic strategy in MM.">

 Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor with a median survival of less than two years. Despite standard therapy of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, GBMs recur. These recurrences may partially be due to glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Various subpopulations of GSCs exist, likely attributing to different resistant niches. The mesenchymal (MES) subpopulation may drive radiation (RT) resistance. The transcriptomic shifts that define GSC adaptation to RT remain unknown. This study explores the transcriptomic reprogramming of MES GSCs following RT to identify resistance mechanisms.



 Using dataset GSE162931 from the GEO database and MES gene signatures from PMID:31327527, we analyzed two patient-derived GBM cell lines pre- and post-10 Gy RT. Data for the two cell lines were preprocessed and integrated with Seurat, followed by clustering and UMAP visualization with 2D kernel module-score weighted density plots. Cluster proportion changes between conditions were statistically examined using Chi-squared or Fisher’s tests with adjusted p-values. Differential expression analysis revealed conserved and unique gene markers distinguishing treated from naïve conditions, visualized in volcano plots and heatmaps. A final score integrating module scores and cluster proportions quantified MES traits at the single-cell level. All analyses were conducted in R studio version 4.2.3.



 UMAP, density plots, and cluster proportion changes indicate significant shifts in MES GSC distributions post-RT, suggesting RT selection for specific transcriptomic profiles. Highly MES subclusters exhibit distinctive RT-responsive gene expression patterns. The final scoring revealed enhanced MES traits in post-RT clusters. Distinct clustering patterns in MES GSCs highlight diverse adaptive strategies. Differential expression analysis reveals upregulation of DNA repair genes (SAT1, NDRG1, GADD45A), enhancing genomic stability post-RT, and stemness markers (NES, GDF15), emphasizing self-renewal capacity. Genes supporting oxidative stress management (SQSTM1, DDIT4) were upregulated, while downregulated metabolic genes (PGK1, LDHA) indicate a shift towards oxidative phosphorylation. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified enriched pathways related to DNA repair, cell migration, and differentiation regulation.



 These findings underline the transcriptomic plasticity in MES GSCs that drive RT resistance. Potential targets like AKAP12 and S100A4, essential for maintaining stem-like traits and MES phenotypes, present new therapeutic targets that could be used to combat resistant GSC populations, aiming to reduce tumor recurrence and enhance GBM patient outcomes.

 Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition effectively treats prostate cancer (PCa) by inducing replication stress and cell death through synthetic lethality. However, PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance inevitably develops, necessitating the study of short- and long-term effects. Responses to PARP inhibition in PCa vary from cytostasis to cell death, with the impact of different dosages and durations underexplored. This study examines how temporal and dosage variations of Olaparib (Ola) influence PCa cell phenotypes and identifies mechanisms underlying treatment response and putative therapeutic strategies to address vulnerabilities following PARP inhibition.



 C4-2B cells were treated with 0, 1, and 5 µM Olaparib for 1 and 5 days. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), cell growth assays, microscopy, and western blotting were used to identify pathway alterations and putative vulnerabilities.



 C4-2B cells respond well to clinically relevant doses of olaparib. Morphological assessment at 1 and 5 days suggests significant differences in response based on duration and intensity of treatment. After 1 day, RNA-seq and western blots support a dominant p53-associated cell cycle checkpoint response which may be driven by ATM. By day 5, surviving cells exhibited significant morphology changes indicating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suggesting acquisition of a stress-induced phenotype. RNA-seq and GSEA support phenotypic shifts including EMT and significant changes in fatty acid metabolism. These findings suggest that prolonged PARP inhibition leads to adaptations in surviving cells. Strategies to either co-target cell cycle checkpoint activation or putative survival adaptations show promise in combination with olaparib.



 PARP inhibition induces distinct cellular and metabolic changes based on dosage and duration. Acute exposure may trigger p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, while prolonged exposure results in phenotypic shifts which may promote cell survival. Our study underscores the need for the design of rational combination therapies to address both immediate and long-term effects of treatment.

 Both intrinsic and acquired resistance limit the depth and duration of response to all clinically evaluated anti-KRAS therapies. Genetic resistance mechanisms, identified in nearly half of relapsed patients, include acquisition of mutations that effectively restore KRAS-dependent activities. Reported non-genetic mechanisms include signaling and transcriptional activities that support epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) or transition to cancer subtypes less responsive to KRAS inhibition. We recently reported MYC amplification and TEAD-dependent transcriptional activation by YAP as drivers of resistance to the multi-RAS inhibitor RMC-7977 (RASmulti), the preclinical analog of RMC-6236. Importantly, we showed that cells resistant to RASmulti that harbor amplified MYC could be re-sensitized to RAS inhibition by co-treatment with TEAD inhibitors. These studies motivated us to define the MYC- and TEAD-dependent transcriptional profiles in KRAS-mutant pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. We knocked down MYC using siRNA in a panel of eight human PDAC cell lines to derive the MYC-dependent transcriptome. We found 3,010 MYC-dependent genes, 36% of which support oncogenic KRAS signaling through ERK. To determine the TEAD-dependent transcriptome, we treated a panel of three sets of paired naïve and RASmulti-resistant KPC cell lines, derived from an autochthonous mouse model of PDAC, and of six human KRAS-mutant PDAC cell lines with the TEAD inhibitor IAG933, with RMC-7977, or with the combination. We found 3,865 TEAD-dependent genes in mouse cells and 3,590 TEAD-dependent genes in human cells. We found co-regulated RAS, MYC, and TEAD gene transcriptional networks enriched for essential genes that support cell cycle progression. We also found distinct gene clusters regulated by each protein that support distinct molecular functions, such as protein biosynthesis, RHO GTPases, and immune signaling. Importantly, combined inhibition of TEAD and RAS led to a more robust downregulation of essential genes than either single treatment. Proteomic profiling of PDAC cell lines with acquired resistance to RMC-7977 showed upregulation of TEAD-dependent gene products, supporting TEAD activation as a non-genetic mechanism of acquired resistance. Together, our findings expand the role of MYC and TEAD in supporting PDAC cell growth and resistance to RAS inhibition and provide rationale for further evaluation of combination therapeutic strategies to limit resistance.

 Uncontrolled proliferation is one of the most important hallmarks of cancer. Consequently, cancer cells exhibit a high demand for oxygen and nutrients from the tumor microenvironment. Nonetheless, cancer cells in the core region of a solid tumor often undergo nutrient and oxygen deficiency owing to the restricted vascularization, ultimately leading to the occurrence of metabolic stress. To survive under stress, series of stress response will be activated, providing opportunities for cancer cells to confront unfavorable circumstances and further developing phenotypic plasticity. Without altering genetic sequence, phenotypic plasticity enables cancer cells to adjust their behavior to survive from stress. This critical ability of cancer cells is orchestrated by multiple stress response under different stress stimuli, but its regulatory mechanism upon metabolic stress still requires further investigation. We identified a transcription factor EGR1 that is rapidly induced upon metabolic stress in breast cancer (BC). Known as an immediate early gene, EGR1 can be upregulated by multiple types of stimulation and further regulates tumor progression. Through cell viability and anoikis assay, we found that EGR1 could promote BC cell survival upon metabolic stress under both attach and detach condition. Furthermore, through xenograft tumor model, we noticed the inhibitory effect of EGR1 on tumor growth was more obvious in the late phase of tumor development, when metabolic stress mostly occurred. These results demonstrated the role of EGR1 in regulating phenotypic plasticity to promote BC cell growth upon metabolic stress. To identified genes regulated by EGR1 upon metabolic stress, EGR1-based ChIP-Seq was performed, and further compared with glucose deprivation RNA-Seq data to identify overlapping genes. Being the most upregulated overlapping gene upon glucose deprivation, HERPUD1 was chosen for further validation. HERPUD1 has been found to be important for degrading unfolded or misfolded protein in unfolded protein response (UPR). However, the role of HERPUD1 upon metabolic stress remains elusive. We found HERPUD1 expression significantly increased upon metabolic stress and was higher in EGR1 knockdown (KD) cells, suggesting EGR1 was a transcriptional suppressor upon metabolic stress. As a critical stress response to promote phenotypic plasticity, UPR was diminished in EGR1 KD cells due to higher expression of HERPUD1, potentially explaining the increased vulnerability of these cells to metabolic stress. Collectively, EGR1 was identified as a transcription factor significantly upregulated upon metabolic stress. By suppressing HERPUD1 expression, EGR1 maintained UPR at an optimal level, which promoted the development of phenotypic plasticity of BC cells and assisted cells to survive and thrive from metabolic stress.

 Background:
 Despite advances in therapies, the development of drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) poses a significant challenge. The emergence of neoantigen-based therapies offer a promising new frontier which enhances treatment efficacy and reduces associated costs.
 Methods:
 A total of 24 patients diagnosed with NSCLC were enrolled in this study. Primary tumor tissues and peripheral blood samples were collected from each patient. Paired whole exome and transcriptomic sequencing data were performed to identify somatic mutations and to quantify their respective expression levels. Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions or deletions (inDels) were detected using Strelka algorithm from whole exome sequencing (WES) data. Neoantigen prediction focused on human leukocyte antigens (HLA) type 1. HLA alleles were predicted using WES data encoding adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples, identifying four alleles that were present in at least 50% of the patients. Neoantigens were considered potentially immunogenic if their predicted median IC50 binding scores were ≤500nM while expressed transcripts per million (TPM) exceeds 1 in tumor samples.
 Results:
 Using systematic bioinformatics pipeline, we analyzed 24 NSCLC samples with matched tumor tissues and peripheral blood, and detected the 4677 mutations involving 2442 genes, including 2819 missense SNVs, 941 InDels, 229 gene fusion and 688 RNA alternative splicing events, 94.7% of which (4428 mutations involving in 2247 genes) were common with those reported in the TCGA-LUAD dataset. The average number of mutations was 194.8 in NSCLCs. We found that C>T/G>A transitions/ transversions were dominant. Missense mutations were the most frequent types of somatic mutation in the coding sequence regions. 98% of mutated genes were not detected simultaneously with DNA and RNA mutations.
 ADCK5
 ,
 CD151
 and
 EIF3K
 were identified as potential new driver genes. Genomic variation profiling identified 2213 potential neoantigens with a median IC50 binding score of ≤500nM and a transcript expression level of >1 TPM. Among these, 41 were listed in databases TSNAdb, IEDB, and CTDatabase. A total of 14 genes harboring identical mutations were detected, with the identical mutations observed in over 50% of the patient cohort. Notably, mutations in 14 genes were either gene fusions or RNA alternative splicing events, and core antigenic sequences generated were found to be identical in the majority of patients. Of particular interest is the RPRD2 gene, where an RNA exitrons site was detected in all patient samples, along with the identification of the same neoantigen core sequence.
 Conclusions:
 Our analysis suggests that gene fusions and RNA splicing variations are more likely than point mutations to generate shared antigens, underscoring their importance for developing targeted immunotherapies.

        <tr id="Background Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) is considered a permanent cell cycle arrest following DNA-damaging treatments; however, its irreversibility has recently been challenged. Here, we demonstrate that escape from TIS is universal across breast cancer cells. Moreover, TIS provides a reversible drug resistance mechanism that ensures the survival of the population, and could contribute to relapse. Methods TIS was induced in four different breast cancer cell line with high-dose chemotherapy and cultured until cells escaped TIS. Parental, TIS and repopulating cells were analyzed by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and surface proteomics. A genetically engineered mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer was used to prove why current senolytics cannot overcome TIS in tumors. Results Screening the toxicity of a diverse panel of FDA-approved anticancer drugs revealed that TIS meditates resistance to half of these compounds, despite their distinct mechanism of action. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, along with surface proteome analysis, showed that while parental and repopulating cells are almost identical, TIS cells are significantly different from both, highlighting their transient nature. Furthermore, investigating dozens of known drug resistance mechanisms offered no explanation for this unique drug resistance pattern. Additionally, TIS cells expressed a gene set associated with immune evasion and a potential KRAS-driven escape mechanism from TIS. Conclusion Our results reveal that TIS, as a transient drug resistance mechanism, could contribute to overcome the immune response and to relapse by reverting to a proliferative stage.

 Mismatch repair (MMR) status plays a critical role in colorectal cancer (CRC), influencing tumor biology and response to therapies. MMR-deficient (MMR-d) tumors, characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI), exhibit high mutation burdens and increased T cell infiltration, whereas MMR-proficient (MMR-p) tumors typically demonstrate low T cell density and poor immune checkpoint inhibitor response. Despite well-documented clinical implications, the molecular and cellular differences of T cells in the tumor microenvironment between MMR-d and MMR-p CRC remain incompletely understood.



 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were analyzed using the CellChat R package to identify ligand-receptor interactions enriched in MMR-p colorectal cancer. Differentially enriched pathways involving T cells were identified and subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to uncover biological processes specific to these interactions. Validation was performed using spatial transcriptomic data from the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) to confirm ligand-receptor co-expression in a spatial context.



 CellChat analysis revealed significant enrichment of TNFRSF14-associated signaling pathways (BTLA-TNFRSF14, LTA-TNFRSF14, and TNFS14-TNFRSF14) in MMR-p CRC. Functional analysis of TNFRSF14+ T cells in MMR-p tumors demonstrated upregulation of pathways related to leukocyte migration, negative regulation of T cell activation, and immune effector process regulation, as identified through GO enrichment analysis. Validation using spatial transcriptomic data confirmed co-expression of the BTLA-TNFRSF14 ligand-receptor pair in a single MSS sample but did not support broader enrichment across MMR-p samples.



 These findings highlight distinct ligand-receptor interactions and immune regulatory processes in MMR-p CRC, particularly involving TNFRSF14 signaling. While functional analysis underscores the role of these interactions in shaping T cell activity, spatial transcriptomic validation suggests heterogeneity in their enrichment across samples. This underscores the complexity of immune microenvironment regulation in MMR-p CRC tumors.

        <tr id="Background Colon cancer (CC) is one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide, with rising incidence rates in both developed and developing countries. Although advances in treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies have been made, prognosis for advanced colon cancer, particularly with metastasis, remains poor. Recent studies highlight the significant role of post-transcriptional modifications like acetylation in cancer biology, affecting processes like gene transcription, metabolism, and tumor progression. Methods This study applied multi-omics analyses, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and Mendelian randomization. Data were obtained from public datasets like GSE132465, UCSC Xena, and GeneCards. We focused on acetylation-related genes, specifically NAT10 and GNE, using scoring methods, cell–cell interaction models, and survival analyses to investigate their role in colon cancer development, metastasis, and immune evasion. Results This study identifies that NAT10 is highly expressed in epithelial cells of colorectal cancer (CC) and is closely associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that NAT10-positive epithelial cells exhibited strong interactions with myeloid cells and T cells, with significant differences in cell–cell communication (p < 0.05). Based-on-summary-data Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis further supports a causal relationship between NAT10 and colorectal cancer. In the MR analysis, a significant positive correlation was observed between NAT10 and colorectal cancer risk using summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies (β_SMR = 0.004, p_SMR = 0.041, p_HEIDI = 0.737). These findings suggest that NAT10 may serve as a pathogenic factor in colorectal cancer development, providing additional genetic evidence that links this acetylation-related gene to colorectal cancer. Survival analysis further demonstrated that NAT10-positive epithelial cells are associated with poorer prognosis. In the TCGA dataset, patients with NAT10-positive epithelial cells exhibited a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.012). Unlike GNE-positive cells, NAT10-positive epithelial cells exhibited immune escape characteristics, and TIDE analysis indicated that NAT10-positive epithelial cells were associated with a lower response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (p = 1.3e−5), suggesting that they may impair the efficacy of immunotherapy by promoting immune evasion. In contrast, GNE was also significantly expressed in epithelial cells of colorectal cancer, but its role differs from that of NAT10. GNE-positive epithelial cells demonstrated strong communication with immune cells, particularly in interactions between myeloid cells and T cells through receptor-ligand pairs. Despite the important role of GNE-positive epithelial cells in the tumor microenvironment, their association with immune escape is weaker compared to NAT10. Survival analysis revealed that GNE-positive epithelial cells were associated with a better prognosis (p = 0.015). In the TCGA dataset, patients with GNE-positive epithelial cells displayed longer disease-free survival (DFS), contrary to the results from the SMR analysis. Conclusions Leveraging SMR and multi-omics analysis, this study highlights the significant role of acetylation-related genes, particularly NAT10, in colon cancer. The findings suggest that acetylation modifications in epithelial cells contribute to immune evasion and cancer progression. NAT10 could serve as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for early diagnosis and targeted therapy, offering new avenues for improving colon cancer treatment and patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating malignancy with a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of approximately 12%. More than 90% of PDAC patients harbor oncogenic mutations in the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral homolog (KRAS) gene. MRTX1133 (MRTX), a novel inhibitor of KRASG12D (the most common KRAS mutation found in pancreatic and colon cancers) has shown promise as a therapeutic agent. To address reported resistance to MRTX, we adapted our anti-leukemia co-targeting strategy and evaluated a combination of MRTX and Bedaquiline (BED), an FDA-approved inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP production, in in vitro human PDAC models. The combination of MRTX and BED demonstrated enhanced cytotoxic effects by disrupting all 11 genes within the DNA helicase family (CMG complex: CDC45-MCM-GINS), which are essential for initiating DNA replication and regulating cell cycle progression. Notably, real-world data analysis from Caris Life Sciences and NCI-TCGA database revealed that low transcriptomic expression of the DNA helicase CMG complex was significantly associated with prolonged survival (e.g., low CDC45 expression and low GINS2 expression with greater than 8 months longer overall survival) in PDAC patients with KRASG12 mutations (N = 9,717; P < 0.00001). However, this combination therapy also triggered strong pro-survival nuclear reprogramming. This effect was mediated by significant genetic activation of an NFκB2-DDIT (DNA damage-induced transcript) axis, which supported tumor chromosomal integrity and DNA repair mechanisms. To overcome NFκB2-driven resistance mechanisms, we explored a triple-targeting strategy that addresses metabolic and genomic plasticity in addition to actively intercepting cell division. This approach combines MRTX1133, Bedaquiline, and the NFκB2 inhibitor SN52, offering a novel therapeutic avenue to treat aggressive pancreatic cancer and potentially improve patient outcomes.

 Pediatric acute myeloid leukemias (AML) are aggressive malignancies characterized by rapid progression, therapy resistance, and poor outcomes, frequently originating during fetal development or early infancy. Unlike adult leukemias, which generally arise from a decades-long accumulation of genetic mutations, pediatric leukemias emerge following genetic alterations occurring prenatally or shortly after birth. However, the biological mechanisms underlying this age-dependent susceptibility and aggressiveness remain largely unexplained. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a novel humanized model of pediatric AML driven by the NUP98::NSD1 fusion oncogene, clinically associated with chemotherapy resistance and dismal prognosis, particularly when accompanied by mutations in the transcription factor WT1. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to induce endogenous expression of this fusion oncogene directly in human primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) isolated from distinct developmental stages, we demonstrate that leukemia initiation, lineage specification, and therapeutic response critically depend on the developmental stage of the initiating cells. We found that fetal-derived HSPCs readily underwent leukemia transformation upon expression of the NUP98::NSD1 fusion, especially when co-occurring with WT1 mutations. In contrast, postnatal HSPCs exhibited progressively diminished leukemia transformation potential. Single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses uncovered distinct transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes associated with developmental stage-specific leukemia initiation, leukemia stem cell hierarchies, and therapeutic vulnerabilities between fetal and postnatal-origin leukemias. Clinically, NUP98-rearranged AML exhibiting fetal-like transcriptional programs correlated strongly with worse patient outcomes. Furthermore, fetal-derived leukemias displayed unique metabolic dependencies, contributing to enhanced therapy resistance. Leveraging these insights, we identified and therapeutically targeted vulnerabilities including oxidative phosphorylation and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Indeed, therapeutic strategies exploiting these developmental-stage-specific susceptibilities effectively overcame resistance in combination therapies and significantly reduced leukemia burden in our preclinical and patient-derived xenograft models. Together, our findings reveal an unappreciated developmental dimension in leukemia biology, illustrating how developmental context critically shapes leukemia potential, lineage fate decisions, and therapeutic response - even among leukemias with identical oncogenic mutations. This work strongly supports the development of age-specific precision oncology strategies to overcome therapy resistance and improve survival outcomes in pediatric patients with aggressive fusion-driven leukemias.

 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents a major medical challenge due to its aggressive progression and a dismal 5-year overall survival rate of only 7%. While SCLC initially responds well to chemotherapy, the rapid relapse and emergence of therapy-resistant tumors remain critical barriers to effective treatment. We hypothesized that therapy response is associated with genome evolution, which, in turn, influences transcriptional plasticity. This study aims to decipher the clonal evolution and transcriptomic adaptations in response to chemotherapy in SCLC.



 We established over 100 patient-derived xenotransplant models from clinical SCLC specimens, capturing diverse genetic features and clinical characteristics. A representative subset of 33 models was selected to replicate clinical scenarios in mice, modeling the effects of platinum-based chemotherapy and evaluating tumor responses under controlled conditions. Whole-exome sequencing and single-cell transcriptome profiling were performed to investigate genomic evolutionary trajectories and transcriptional plasticity in therapy-naïve and relapsed tumors.



 Xenotransplant models accurately reflect patient responses to chemotherapy. To our surprise, several models from relapsed patients retained sensitivity to treatment. Chemotherapy-resistant models maintain their tumor clones, whereas sensitive models show dynamic shifts from a common ancestral clone with emerging subclones shaped by mutations associated with platinum damage, APOBEC activity, and defective DNA damage repair. The genomic landscape, defined by subclonal mutations and copy number alterations, strongly impacts transcriptomic patterns. Specifically sensitive models post-chemotherapy reveal a strong shift of transcriptional programs reflecting adaptive plasticity as a consequence of genome evolution.



 Here we provide an in-depth functional in vivo characterization of clonal adaptions in SCLC under therapy. Chemotherapy drives the selection of subclones with favorable genomic features, which in turn impact the broader transcriptomic landscape. Our data provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms of therapy resistance.

        <tr id="One of the key challenges in defeating advanced tumors is the ability of cancer cells to evade the selective pressure imposed by chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy and cellular therapies. Both genetic and epigenetic alterations contribute to the development of resistance, allowing cancer cells to survive initially effective treatments. In this narration, we explore how genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms influence the state of tumor cells and their responsiveness to different therapeutic strategies. We further propose that an altered balance between cell growth and cell death is a fundamental driver of drug resistance. Cell death programs exist in various forms, shaped by cell type, triggering factors, and microenvironmental conditions. These processes are governed by temporal and spatial constraints and appear to be more heterogeneous than previously understood. To capture the intricate interplay between death-inducing signals and survival mechanisms, we introduce the concept of Death-ision. This framework highlights the dynamic nature of cell death regulation, determining whether specific cancer cell clones evade or succumb to therapy. Building on this understanding offers promising strategies to counteract resistant clones and enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, combining DNMT inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade may counteract YAP1-driven resistance or the use of transcriptional CDK inhibitors could prevent or overcome chemotherapy resistance. Death-ision aims to provide a deeper understanding of the diversity and evolution of cell death programs, not only at diagnosis but also throughout disease progression and treatment adaptation.">

 For decades, the mechanism of action towards research of cancer therapies have been deciphered by the isolated analyses of transcriptomics, proteomics, or cell morphology to resolve heterogeneous responses in a series of assays requiring multiple biological samples which limit the ability to capture the full picture of the biological response. Integrating these readouts through multiplexed analysis enables a comprehensive understanding of how gene expression relates to functional outcomes and phenotypic effects, offering a holistic view for research of cellular processes impacted by treatment. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly advanced the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) yet achieving consistent and durable patient responses remains a challenge. In this research study, we utilized AVITI24 Teton CytoProfiling, a platform that enables spatial co-detection of RNA, protein, phospho-proteins, and cell morphology at subcellular resolution within a single biological sample. This approach allowed us to resolve complex systemic responses to TKIs in three NSCLC cell lines. Specifically, three NSCLC cell lines were treated with Gefitinib or Osimertinib to investigate therapy-induced molecular and morphological changes in both TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant cells. Single-cell analysis uncovered significant heterogeneity in RNA and protein expression, with distinct patterns emerging between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells. For example, in Gefitinib-treated A549 cells, we observed notable pathway inhibition, including reductions in phosY1068-EGFR (Log2FC -0.108) and phosTY-ERK12 (Log2FC -0.237). Conversely, the resistant cell line NCI-H1975 showed minimal changes alongside other distinct responses within the MAPK pathway. Drug-specific morphological changes further highlighted how these therapies influence cellular architecture in ways that correlate with functional outcomes. And by resolving cellular heterogeneity at the single-cell level, these insights—often obscured by bulk analyses—shed light on the intricate mechanisms of both therapeutic effects and resistance development. Our findings demonstrate the potential of multi-omics platforms like AVITI24 Teton CytoProfiling to address critical challenges in cancer research. By consolidating transcriptomic, proteomic, and morphological data in a single assay with subcellular spatial resolution, this platform facilitates the resolution of multidimensional mechanisms underlying tumor responsiveness and drug resistance. By bridging molecular and morphology insights, our study provides a powerful framework for studying the intricate dynamics of targeted therapies in NSCLC, paving the way for innovative strategies to enhance cancer treatment and personalize patient care.

        <tr id="Bone metastases represent frequent and severe complications in various cancers, notably impacting prognosis and quality of life. This review article delves into the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underpinning drug resistance in bone metastases, a key challenge in effective cancer treatment. The development of drug resistance in cancer can manifest as either intrinsic or acquired, with genetic heterogeneity playing a pivotal role. Intrinsic resistance is often due to pre-existing mutations, while acquired resistance evolves through genetic and epigenetic alterations during treatment. These alterations include mutations in driver genes like TP53 and RB1, epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone changes, and pathway alterations, notably involving RANK-RANKL signaling and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade. Recent studies underline the significance of the tumor microenvironment in fostering drug resistance, with components such as cancer-associated fibroblasts and hypoxia playing crucial roles. The interactions between metastatic cancer cells and the bone microenvironment facilitate survival and the proliferation of drug-resistant clones. This review highlights the necessity of understanding these complex interactions to develop targeted therapies that can overcome resistance and improve treatment outcomes. Current therapeutic strategies and future directions are discussed, emphasizing the integration of genomic profiling and targeted interventions in managing bone metastases. The evolving landscape of genetic research, including the application of next-generation sequencing and CRISPR technology, offers promising avenues for novel and more effective therapeutic strategies.

 Efficacy of targeted therapies in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is hindered by onset of resistance, therefore novel strategies are needed. A subpopulation of drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs) survives to targeted therapies and initiates adaptive mutability response. DTPs experience an increased DNA damage and a shift to error-prone DNA damage repair, thus promoting mutability and resistance.



 The purpose of this project is to explore key players modulating adaptive mutability to prevent DTPs’ evolution to resistance, thus preventing tumor recurrence.



 CAS9-expressing CRC cells were infected with a custom CRISPR library targeting over 500 DNA damage response (DDR) genes, divided in 12 subpopulations, and grown either for 4 weeks in normal cell culture conditions (untreated) or treated with specific oncogenic inhibitors until the development of resistance in a Time-To-Progression (TTP) assay. CAS9-expressing clones infected with empty library were grown in parallel, in absence or presence of targeted therapies, as control. Next Generation Sequencing-based analysis of sgRNA (single guides RNA) was then performed on resistant subpopulations grown in the presence of targeted therapies.



 We initially isolated CAS9-expressing clones from a microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC cell line and selected clones with growth rate and drug-sensitivity comparable to that of parental population. The selected CAS9-expressing clone was then infected with the CRISPR DDR library or empty library and, after the selection with puromycin, the selected populations were divided in 12 subpopulations, to exclude the possibility that pre-existing resistant cells might outgrow and interfere with the effect of DDR genes knock-outs (KO) on the development of drug-resistance. The subpopulations were then grown in absence or presence of oncogenic inhibitors for several weeks until the onset of resistance. Notably, while the 12 subpopulations infected with the empty library simultaneously developed resistance, the development of resistance in the DDR library-infected cells was spread over multiple weeks, thus highlighting that KO of DDR genes might either accelerate or delay the onset of resistance. sgRNA of resistant population were then analyzed by next-generation sequencing. A negative selection analysis will be applied to identify sgRNA that are lost in the resistant populations, thus targeting DDR genes whose depletion is potentially synthetical lethal with targeted therapies in mCRC.



 A DDR CRISPR screening identified novel vulnerabilities of CRC DTPs able to improve efficacy of targeted therapies and prevent tumor relapse in mCRC.

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis, since most PDAC tumors develop resistance to the standard of care (SoC) treatments like chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies. All tumors consist of multiple, genetically related subpopulations of cancer cells that evolve in parallel and display heterogeneity at genomic, epigenetic, or phenotypic levels. As cancer develops, some subpopulations of cancer cells may show faster growth, increased metastatic potential, and resistance toward SoC treatment. A key challenge in PDAC management is understanding chemoresistance driven by cancer subpopulation dynamics. This would broaden our understanding of tumor adaptation to treatments and guide targeting resistant subpopulations to improve therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we identified PDAC cell subpopulations resistant to chemotherapy using our DNA barcoding system B-GLI (barcode-guide lineage isolation). The B-GLI system leverages a highly complex DNA barcode library and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) to trace and isolate sub-lineages within heterogeneous cell populations by their DNA barcodes. PDAC cell lines PANC-1 and Mia-PaCa-2 were barcoded with the B-GLI barcode library, which consist of two optimized guide RNA binding sites in each barcode. After DNA barcoding, we performed treatments with two SoC chemotherapeutics, gemcitabine + paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX, to induce a selection pressure in the PDAC cell lines, and then identified the resistant subpopulations through differentially represented barcodes and sequencing. Furthermore, we designed barcode-specific single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the resistant subpopulations and activated the expression of the puromycin resistance gene by CRISPRa. This allowed us to enrich and isolate chemoresistant subpopulations by puromycin treatment. After having isolated the resistant PDAC subpopulations, we performed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq for molecular characterization of the resistant and parental cell populations, along with phenotypic drug screening with 384 compounds to identify novel treatment vulnerabilities. The compound testing confirmed that the resistant cells were less sensitive to the two SoC treatments, as well as identified selective sensitivity to specific compounds. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data will allow us to decode whether and how chromatin structure and transcriptomic changes are associated with the treatment resistance, and the confirmation screen of the drug sensitivities will identify potential compounds for future pre-clinical and clinical testing in PDAC models and patients with resistant disease. In summary, this study will identify targeted treatment alternatives, accompanied by molecular biomarkers for chemotherapy resistant PDAC.

 Ovarian cancer, characterized by its heterogeneity and resistance to conventional therapies such as cisplatin (CDDP), presents a significant clinical challenge. To address these challenges, we combined genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening, single-cell-CRISPR Purterb RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and AI-driven virtual screening to identify novel chemoresistance mechanisms and evaluate potential therapeutic strategies. This integrated approach aims to reveal genetic determinants and actionable therapeutic targets to improve treatment outcomes.



 We performed genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening in ovarian cancer cell lines treated with CDDP, erastin, and a combination of elesclomol and copper (ES+Cu), identifying genes involved in drug resistance mechanisms. Differential gene candidates will be prioritized based on its strong association with resistance across the drug treatments. AI-based virtual screening will be employed to identify novel drugs targeting the candidates. Additionally, surviving cells from drug treatments will be subjected to scRNA-seq to reveal distinct cell cluster harboring resistance-related gene signatures. We also established ovarian cancer cell lines resistant to CDDP, erastin, and ES+Cu to validate the therapeutic targets and efficacy of the repurposed drugs in both resistant and wild-type cell lines.



 CRISPR screening identified several key genes associated with drug resistance, with YTHDC2 emerging as a central target. Pathway analysis highlighted its role in regulating survival and proliferation in the context of drug-induced stress. AI-driven virtual screening pinpointed Proguanil, Calcipotriol, and Sildenafil as high-affinity binders to YTHDC2, suggesting their potential as targeted therapeutics. scRNA-seq analysis of resistant cancer cells identified key gene cluster with GADD45A and ZFAS1 associated with cisplatin resistance. Gene Ontology and STRING pathway analyses revealed their involvement in DNA damage response and apoptosis regulation. Drug-response assays demonstrated that Proguanil, Calcipotriol, and Sildenafil effectively suppressed cell proliferation in the resistant cell lines. These findings support their potential to overcome the chemotherapy resistance.



 This study integrates CRISPR-based screening, scRNA-seq, and virtual screening to provide the first comprehensive framework for addressing drug resistance in ovarian cancer. The identification of YTHDC2 as a key resistance-related gene and the validation of Proguanil, Calcipotriol, and Sildenafil as potential therapeutics underscore the translational potential. These findings offer new avenues for precision oncology, with the goal of improving outcomes for ovarian cancer patients.

 Synthetic lethality (SL) has emerged as a highly promising therapeutic strategy, gaining significant attention in the field of cancer treatment in recent years. The principle behind SL is that the simultaneous loss or inhibition of two genes results in cell death, while the inhibition of only one gene does not. SL drugs exploit this mechanism by targeting the partner gene of an already inactivated or mutated gene in cancer cells, inducing their death. This approach allows for the precise targeting of genetic vulnerabilities specific to cancer cells, sparing normal tissues from damage. Additionally, SL therapies expand the range of druggable targets, including proteins that are difficult to inhibit with traditional small molecules. By affecting both enzymatic and non-enzymatic protein functions, SL therapies reduce the risk of developing drug resistance, providing an effective option for treating cancers that are resistant to conventional therapies.Kyinno offers an extensive collection of knockout cell lines targeting a range of genes associated with synthetic lethality, including SHLD2, P53, T53BP1, AQR, ATRX, SETD2, ATM, WRN, BRCA1, and BRCA2. These cell lines, developed using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique and validated through sequencing and western blot analysis, are crucial for investigating the complex mechanisms underlying synthetic lethality and for identifying novel therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment. For example, our knockout lines for BRCA1 and BRCA2 enable researchers to investigate vulnerabilities in homologous recombination repair, paving the way for the development of innovative PARP inhibitors and targeted therapies. Additionally, lines with deletions in ATM and WRN provide essential insights into DNA damage response pathways, which can enhance the effectiveness of DNA-damaging agents. The diverse range of gene knockouts, including those involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis, allows for comprehensive studies into the synergistic effects of dual gene inhibition. By utilizing our extensive library of synthetic lethality cell lines, researchers can effectively validate hypotheses, screen novel drug candidates, and optimize combination therapies to improve outcomes for patients with resistant cancers. We highly recommend these resources for advancing research in synthetic lethality and targeted cancer therapies.

 Adoptive T-cell therapy has emerged as a promising approach for the treatment of several malignancies, including melanoma. Despite promising outcomes, therapeutic resistance remains a significant challenge, with limited or transient responses observed in many patients. The molecular mechanisms driving resistance pathways have not been thoroughly studied in vivo. Systematic characterization of the genetic regulators of adoptive T-cell therapeutic resistance is thus critical for designing next-generation of synergistic combination therapies and treatment regimens to enhance efficacy and durability.



 We developed an in vivo CRISPR knockout screening system to identify genetic factors mediating resistance to adoptive T-cell therapy in a melanoma mouse model. To explore potential synergistic therapeutic combinations, we opted to target the easily druggable subset of the human genome, encompassing all known kinases. CRISPR-edited B16-GFP-OVA cells transduced with a mouse CRISPR KO library (Brie: comprising 2, 852 sgRNAs targeting 713 mouse kinase genes) were engrafted into C57BL/6J mice. The mice were divided into two groups: a PBS control group (n=6) and a T-cell treatment group (n=14). Tumors were harvested either at an early (Day X) or later time points (Day Y) for genomic DNA extraction and next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based guide RNA enrichment analysis. Deep sequencing data were analyzed using the MAGeCK pipeline. Functional validation of our top candidates was performed by generating single clones of single-gene CRISPR knockouts and conducting functional profiling using orthogonal assays, including flow cytometry, LDH cytotoxicity assay, and pharmacological inhibition studies to assess target engagement and efficacy.



 The CRISPR screen identified two key regulators of adoptive T-cell resistance, termed NU-ATCTr-101, NU-ATCTr-102. Single-gene knockouts of these targets significantly enhanced T-cell-mediated killing in vitro. Pharmacological inhibition of NU-ATCTr-101 demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity and enhanced T-cell response. Mechanistic studies revealed alterations in antigen presentation, PD-L1 expression, and T-cell activation pathways. Bulk RNA sequencing and additional pathway analyses are ongoing to further elucidate precise molecular mechanisms underpinning these enhanced therapeutic outcomes.



 Our findings identify NU-ATCTr-101 and NU-ATCTr-102 as potential therapeutic targets to overcome resistance to adoptive T-cell therapy. Synergistic pharmacological interventions targeting these kinases may serve as promising adjuvants towards the development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies. Future studies will focus on validating these findings across additional human cancer model systems to evaluate and expedite their translational potential.

        <tr id="The tumorigenesis of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (siNETs) is not understood and comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic data sets are limited. Therefore, we performed whole genome and transcriptome analysis of 39 well differentiated siNET samples. Our genomic data revealed a lack of recurrent driver mutations and demonstrated that multifocal siNETs from individual patients can arise genetically independently. We detected germline mutations in Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway (FANC) genes, involved in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair, in 9% of patients and found mutational signatures of defective HR DNA repair in late-stage tumor evolution. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed low expression of the transcriptional repressor REST. Summarizing, we identify a novel common transcriptomic signature of siNETs and demonstrate that genomic alterations alone do not explain initial tumor formation, while impaired DNA repair likely contributes to tumor evolution and represents a potential pharmaceutical target in a subset of patients.">

Genome sequencing of malignant tumors allowed, on one hand, to identify driver mutations in carcinogenic genes in different organs, and on the other – to use mutated genes for targeted therapy. Study of biological functions of these genes from the point of view of their contribution to carcinogenesis allows to better understand its mechanism.

 Mutational processes such as chromosomal instability and replication stress are important molecular features of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), contributing to poor patient survival. Their changing influences during cancer development creates challenges in identifying response biomarkers. Patient-derived organoid 3D cancer models (PDOs) have been shown to match their primary source material and to reflect tumour biology more faithfully than cell lines. In our companion abstract, we detail how we have built the Digital Biological Twin lab to study PDOs for drug testing and biomarker discovery. In this work, we used PDOs to investigate resistance to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), which are mechanistically linked to DNA repair and replication. 10 PDOs (6 HNSCC, 4 NSCLC) generated from untreated tumor resections were bulk RNA-sequenced and treated with Niraparib. IC50, cell viability measured by flow cytometry and protein expression levels were used to classify 3 PDOs as sensitive to treatment. Expression analysis, stratifying by PARPi sensitivity, resulted in 287 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Enrichment analyses found involvement of the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and small molecule transport pathways. Knowing that EMT is linked to multi-drug resistance, we treated the PDOs with Cisplatin and found a significant correlation to PARPi IC50 values. By examining the biology of the DEGs, we categorized them using MSigDB into five gene sets, each with 1 to 14 genes. We functionally validated the gene sets by assessing PARPi susceptibility in 45 cell lines pre and post a genome-wide CRISPR knockout, finding four significantly enriched in PARPi gene dependencies. For two replication stress-derived gene sets, we demonstrated significant concordance between PARPi sensitivity status of PDOs and cell lines from DepMap, and with progression free interval of HNSCC and NSCLC patients from TCGA. Leveraging Cox analysis on these patients, one replication stress gene set stratified the patients by showing a significant decrease in relapse probability. In summary, our results indicate that PARPi resistance is associated with the deregulation of genes related to small molecule transport, multi-drug resistance and EMT. The consistent findings around replication stress across disease models strongly suggests a conserved and central role in resistance mechanisms. We also identify a replication stress gene set that significantly correlates with resistance in cancer models and relapse in patients. Further work is needed to translate our findings into a predictive model for drugs linked to replication stress. Here we showed that PDOs can be successfully used for furthering our understanding of resistance mechanisms while improving molecular stratification of patients with direct clinical implications.

 Estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (ER+BC) represents nearly 75% of all breast tumors, with nearly 20-40% patients eventually developing metastases. Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor which has been approved for use in combination with exemestane in patients with metastatic ER+BC. However, many patients eventually develop resistance to everolimus leading to poor survival outcomes. Systematic characterization of the molecular phenotypes underlying everolimus resistance could reveal new therapeutic targets for metastatic ER+BC. We analyzed transcriptomic profiles from multiple pairs of everolimus resistant or sensitive ER+BC cell lines, to identify signaling mechanisms that distinguish resistant cells both at baseline and under everolimus treatment. Using linear mixed-effects models, we identified strong activation of the growth-factor signaling meta-phenotype in resistant cells at baseline, which persisted even under everolimus treatment. This meta-phenotype included alternate growth signaling mechanisms including IGF1R/insulin, ESR1, RAS and MAPK signaling. To understand the regulatory mechanism behind alternate growth-factor signaling activation, we adopted a network reconstruction architecture to identify SMARCD3 regulons as key transcriptional regulatory networks in resistant cells. In a neo-adjuvant trial for ER+BC patients, the expression levels of SMARCD3 and its regulon’s activity were significantly elevated in tumors refractory to everolimus. To develop a therapeutic strategy against everolimus resistance, we used transcriptomic and drug sensitivity profiles of 926 cancer cell lines treated with 395 compounds. We found that the activation of SMARCD3 regulons was consistently associated with sensitivity to several known MEK1/2 inhibitors, including trametinib. To validate these findings, we evaluated the efficacy of everolimus in combination with trametinib and demonstrate that the combination treatment significantly reduced the growth of resistant cells compared to everolimus. Our results demonstrate that everolimus resistant ER+BC cells utilize alternate growth-factor signaling to escape therapeutic control. We found that this phenotype is strongly linked with activation of the SMARCD3 regulons and can be therapeutically targeted using MEK1/2 inhibitors.

        <tr id="Colon cancer accounts for nearly 10% of all cancer diagnoses annually. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colon cancer is a particularly aggressive subtype of colon cancer that is known to have a significant number of genetic mutations. Microsatellite instability (MSI) refers to genetic hypermutability caused by the dysfunction of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, which leads to errors in repetitive DNA sequences and is a hallmark of certain cancers, including MSI-H colon cancer. MSI-H colon cancer acts on the DNA mismatch repair system causing an accumulation of mutations in microsatellite regions of the DNA. These mutations have been linked with increased tumorigenesis and decreased response to conventional forms of chemotherapy for colon cancer. However, this increased tumor burden results in significant production of neoantigens which makes these tumors immunogenic and therefore perfect candidates for pairing with immunotherapy. As a result, adjuvant immunotherapy in MSI-H colon cancer has become a burgeoning field of research, and synthesizing information regarding the efficacy of these immunotherapies is the goal of this literature review. Pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), was among the first to receive approval for the treatment of MSI-H colon cancer and was observed to have significant efficacy versus traditional chemotherapy with statistically significant improvements in metrics such as progression-free survival (PFS), overall response (OR), and disease-free survival (DFS). Similarly, Nivolumab, another PD-1 inhibitor, and the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor) were granted Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of MSI-H colon cancer and have also shown the ability to outperform traditional chemotherapy with a higher overall response rate (ORR), mean PFS, and overall survival rates. Off-label uses of existing adjuvant immunotherapies such as Atezolizumab (a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor) and Durvalumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) have shown promise with preliminary results showing higher DFS and recurrence-free survival but need further data collection. Emerging immunotherapy targets such as lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) and T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobin and Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibitory Motif domains (TIGIT) inhibitors show preliminary promise and may one day become a part of the approach to the treatment of MSI-H colon cancer. This review highlights current advancements, challenges, and emerging trends in the application of immunotherapy for MSI-H colon cancer, with a focus on improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract APOBEC mutagenesis is one of the most common endogenous sources of mutations in human cancer and is a major source of genetic intratumor heterogeneity. High levels of APOBEC mutagenesis are associated with poor prognosis and aggressive disease across diverse cancers, but the mechanistic and functional impacts of APOBEC mutagenesis on tumor evolution and therapy resistance remain relatively unexplored. To address this, we investigated the contribution of APOBEC mutagenesis to acquired therapy resistance in a model of EGFR-mutant non–small cell lung cancer. We find that inhibition of EGFR in lung cancer cells leads to a rapid and pronounced induction of APOBEC3 expression and activity. Functionally, APOBEC expression promotes the survival of drug-tolerant persister cells (DTP) following EGFR inhibition. Constitutive expression of APOBEC3B alters the evolutionary trajectory of acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, making it more likely that resistance arises through de novo acquisition of the T790M gatekeeper mutation and squamous transdifferentiation during the DTP state. APOBEC3B expression is associated with increased expression of the squamous cell transcription factor ΔNp63 and squamous cell transdifferentiation in gefitinib-resistant cells. Knockout of p63 in gefitinib-resistant cells reduces the expression of the ΔNp63 target genes IL-1α/β and sensitizes these cells to the third-generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib. These results suggest that APOBEC activity promotes acquired resistance by facilitating evolution and transdifferentiation in DTPs and that approaches to target ΔNp63 in gefitinib-resistant lung cancers may have therapeutic benefit. Significance: APOBEC mutagenesis is a common source of genetic heterogeneity in cancer, and APOBEC mutational signatures are enriched in metastatic and drug-resistant tumors. However, the mechanisms through which APOBEC3 enzymes promote tumor evolution remain unknown. In this study, we show that APOBEC3 activity contributes to the development of therapy-resistant cancer cells by promoting evolution of DTP cells. These findings offer insights into the role of APOBEC mutagenesis in cancer progression.">

Prior work showed a more pronounced injury and repair response in LgT versus hTERT cells after chemical challenge. We hypothesized that unique genomic changes occurred after immortalization, altering critical genes and pathways. RNA-seq profiling and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of parent, hTERT, and LgT cells showed that 92.5% of the annotated transcripts were shared, suggesting a conserved proximal tubule expression pattern. However, the cell lines exhibited unique transcriptomic and genomic profiles different from the parent cells. Three transcript classes were quite relevant for chemical challenge response—Cyps, ion channels, and metabolic transporters—each important for renal function. A pathway analysis of the hTERT cells suggested alterations in intermediary and energy metabolism. LgT cells exhibited pathway activation in cell cycle and DNA repair that was consistent with replication stress. Genomic karyotyping by combining WGS and RNA-seq data showed increased gene copy numbers in chromosome 5 for LgT cells, while hTERT cells displayed gene copy losses in chromosomes 4 and 9. These data suggest that the exaggerated transcriptional responses of LgT cells versus hTERT cells result from differences in gene copy numbers, replication stress, and the unique selection processes underlying LgT or hTERT immortalization.">

 Genetic instability is a hallmark of cancer, often arising from mutations in DNA damage repair and response (DDR) proteins. It is our goal to map the repair dependencies associated with different DNA-damaging agents (DDA) and DDR inhibitors (DDRi). To this end, we developed a DDR-targeted, CRISPR knockout screening approach to assess relationships among 355 DNA repair genes and 30 DDA and DDRi in LN229 glioma cells.
 Systems-level analysis of over 11, 000 interactions revealed that DDA cluster into distinct classes. In contrast, DDRi including ATR, Pol-θ, DNA-PK, WRN, Wee1, USP1, ATM and PKMYT1 inhibitors exhibited a variety of unique dependency profiles. Pathway analysis revealed clear associations between the knockout of Fanconi anemia pathway genes and sensitivity to bifunctional alkylating agents (e.g. chlorambucil), nucleotide excision repair and monofunctional alkylating agents (e.g. illudin S), homologous recombination and PARP inhibitors (e.g. talazoparib), and non-homologous end-joining and radiomimetics (e.g. bleomycin).
 Furthermore, this platform identified differences in repair dependencies of compounds with subtle variations in chemical structure, highlighted by the imidazotetrazines temozolomide (TMZ) and KL50. In contrast to the methyl adducts deposited by TMZ, DNA modifications deposited by KL50 slowly evolve into DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), circumventing mismatch repair (MMR)-driven resistance observed with TMZ. Indeed, screening revealed that resistance to TMZ, but not KL50, is driven by loss of MMR genes. Furthermore, we observed that BRIP1, a helicase known to play a key role in repair of ICLs, emerged as a unique sensitizing hit for KL50, but not TMZ, providing biological support for the formation of ICLs by KL50.
 Finally, we sought to identify the most clinically actionable chemo-genomic interactions from our screens. Bi-allelic inactivating mutations (BI) of DNA repair genes are often necessary for manifestation of a DDR deficiency phenotype. Thus, we subjected our gene list to a custom bioinformatic pipeline to quantify rates of BI in samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Excluding genes listed as Level 1 biomarkers on OncoKB, we found that 4.73% of TCGA samples harbored putative BI of at least one of the 138 genes that emerged as a hit (FDR < 0.01) in our screens.
 Overall, our screens validated established chemo-genomic interactions while also identifying genetic dependencies associated with DDA of previously unknown mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we elucidated subtle differences in repair dependencies between structurally similar compounds. Finally, we identified novel genetic biomarkers with frequent BI in human tumor samples that sensitized to specific therapeutic agents upon loss, nominating chemo-genomic interactions with potential clinical relevance.

        <tr id="Radiotherapy (RT) resistance remains a substantial challenge in cancer therapy. Although physical factors are optimizing, the biological mechanisms for RT resistance are still elusive. Herein, we explored potential reasons for this difficult problem by generating RT‐resistant models for in vitro and in vivo experiments. We found that abnormal spindle‐like microcephaly‐associated protein (ASPM) was highly expressed in RT‐resistant samples and significantly correlated with disease advance in lung adenocarcinoma. Mechanistically, ASPM helps RT‐resistant cells to evade spindle checkpoint surveillance and complete cell division after irradiation through destruction of microtubule stability, with subsequent increases in chromosome mis‐segregation and deteriorating chromosomal stability during mitosis. Depletion of ASPM stabilized microtubules and significantly decreased chromosome mis‐segregation, restoring the sensitivity of RT‐resistant cells to radiation. We further found, with bioinformatics analysis, amino acid sequence 963–1263 of ASPM as a potential new drug target for overcoming RT resistance and identified 9 drug pockets within this domain for clinical translation. Our findings suggest that ASPM is a key regulator with an important role in promoting RT resistance in non‐small cell lung cancer, and that suppressing or blocking its expression could be worth exploring as therapy for a variety of RT‐resistant cancers.">

Traditional bulk sequencing methods mask the complexity of intratumoral variation, often overlooking rare subclones that may drive disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Single-cell genomics has emerged as a transformative approach to decipher tumor heterogeneity at unprecedented resolution. This technology enables the dissection of individual cellular populations within lymphomas, offering insights into clonal evolution, transcriptional diversity, and microenvironmental interactions. By applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), chromatin accessibility assays (scATAC-seq), and single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq), researchers can unravel lineage relationships, identify resistant subpopulations, and track dynamic changes in response to therapy. In lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), single-cell approaches have revealed distinct malignant and non-malignant cell states that correlate with treatment outcomes. Moreover, integrating single-cell data with spatial transcriptomics and immune profiling enhances the understanding of the tumor microenvironment, including immune evasion mechanisms. These insights can inform personalized treatment strategies, identify novel therapeutic targets, and enable early detection of relapse. Despite technical challenges such as data complexity, sample viability, and cost, the application of single-cell genomics in lymphoma research is rapidly advancing.

        <tr id="Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer that can be caused by DNA replication stress. Copy number variation (CNV) is a type of genomic instability that has been associated with both tumorigenesis and drug resistance, but how these structural variants form in response to replication stress is not fully understood. Here, we established a direct repeat genetic reporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to detect recombination events that result in either a duplication or a deletion. Using this system, we measured recombination resulting from site-specific replication fork stalling initiated by Tus binding to an array of Ter sites. We found that a Tus/Ter fork block downstream of direct repeats induced CNV by a mechanism involving the Mph1 translocase, Exo1-catalyzed end resection and Rad51-dependent strand invasion. While the Slx4 scaffold protein and its nuclease-binding partner, Rad1, were shown to be required for duplications, we found that they suppress deletion formation in this context. These opposing functions suggest that both recombination products arise through a large loop heteroduplex intermediate that is cleaved by Rad1-Rad10 in a manner that promotes duplications and eliminates deletions. Taken together, these studies give insight into the mechanisms governing CNV in the context of replication fork stalling, which may ultimately provide a better understanding of how replication stress contributes to cancer and other diseases characterized by genome instability.">

 The development of chemoresistance in many cancer patients poses a significant clinical challenge, while the underlying causes for heterogeneous drug responses remain largely elusive. Increasing evidence suggests that tumors exhibit extensive heterogeneity and harbor cancer subpopulations in less differentiated states that are linked to treatment resistance. Therefore, dissecting immature cancer cell states pre-existing in tumors is essential for identifying biomarkers associated with chemoresistance and establishing targeted therapeutic strategies, particularly in breast cancer, where specific biomarkers are largely lacking.



 We utilized CytoTRACE, a robust computational framework for predicting the cellular differentiation status from single-cell RNA sequencing data, to unveil the immature cancer cell state and its associated markers in single-cell atlases of human breast cancer. The association between the identified immature cell state and patient survival was determined by inferring the proportions of epithelial cancer cells expressing the marker gene in bulk gene expression datasets. The MMTV-PyMT mouse breast cancer model was used to experimentally investigate the role of the immature cancer cell state in conferring chemoresistance. Single-cell profiling was conducted on tumor samples before and after treatment to examine the inherent characteristics of immature cancer cells and their response to drug pressure. The results obtained from mouse tumors were subsequently confirmed using human breast cancer models.



 We revealed that BCL11B, a zinc finger transcription factor, defines a distinct immature cancer cell state in human breast cancer that displays basal cell features and demonstrates a heterogeneous expression pattern across breast tumors. Breast cancer patients with higher levels of BCL11B+ cancer cells face a significantly increased risk of relapse following chemotherapy. This pre-existing tumor subpopulation exhibits intrinsic fitness advantages and demonstrates a remarkable ability to evolve into a drug-resistant state through various BCL11B-dependent pre-existing and transcriptional adaptation mechanisms. Notably, TNF-α was pinpointed as a natural inhibitor of BCL11B, and treatment with TNF-α significantly increases chemotherapy efficacy by inducing the exit of the drug-resistant cell state. In conclusion, our findings identify BCL11B as a valuable biomarker for predicting chemotherapy resistance and suggest TNF-α combination treatment for breast cancer patients at high risk of developing chemoresistance.

 Chromatin bivalency plays an important role in cell lineage specification during development. Cancer therapy resistance involves an extensive reprogramming of gene expression resulting in tumor lineage plasticity (LP). However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Rev-erb-alpha, a member of the nuclear receptor transcription factor family, plays a key role in regulation of circadian rhythm and metabolism primarily through repression of its target genes. We performed sequential ChIP-seq epigenome profiling of tumor tissues from the clinic and PDX models of prostate cancer and integrated analysis of tumor epigenome and transcriptome. We also treated the PDX models with small-molecule inhibitors of the receptor. We found that most of the tumor LP genes, including those in programs of neurodevelopment, neural signaling, stemness and EMT, are controlled by bivalent promoters with concurrent marking of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. Our further studies revealed that the bivalent chromatin state resolves during the development of cancer therapy resistance. Interestingly, Rev-erb-alpha plays a critical role in promoting the bivalency resolution and activation of the LP programs. Its pharmacological targeting effectively reverses the bivalency resolution and diminishes the LP in anti-AR therapy-resistant tumors. Therefore, our study establishes that resolution of chromatin bivalency is a major epigenetic mechanism of tumor LP and demonstrates that therapeutic targeting of Rev-erb-alpha represents a novel treatment of advanced prostate cancer.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, with rectal cancer (RC) accounting for one-third of cases. Only 20% of RC patients have a complete response to chemoradiation therapy (CRT) and may be able to avoid surgery, therefore, therapeutic resistance remains a major barrier to improving outcomes. The genetic and cellular heterogeneity of RC, particularly in treatment-resistant sub-clones, suggests that this diversity could be a harbinger of adverse outcomes. A detailed characterization of treatment responses at the subclonal level is critical to advancing targeted therapeutic strategies.



 Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and single-cell RNA sequencing were employed to investigate the cellular and molecular landscape of RC tumors. Two PDX models were established from the primary tumors of pre-treatment RC patients. Mice bearing tumors were subjected to a standard CRT regimen, consisting of 2 Gy daily radiation and 100mg/kg capecitabine daily for two weeks, followed by a week-long rest period. Tumor tissues were collected at baseline and at various post-treatment intervals for sequencing.



 Our scRNA-seq analysis of one PDX model identified five distinct tumor clusters with varying responses to treatment. Two clusters demonstrated initial sensitivity to CRT, followed by a resurgence, indicating potential therapy resistance. Pathway analysis revealed cluster-specific activation of critical oncogenic pathways, including HIF-1, p53, and FoxO signaling pathways. These pathways are implicated in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance, and the associated marker genes present potential targets for intervention. Lineage tracing of tumor cells uncovered two differentiation trajectories, with one showing increased resistance. Cell-cell communication analysis highlighted extensive interactions among tumor sub-populations, particularly mediated by CLDN3-CLDN3 adhesion, which may contribute to therapeutic resistance. Additionally, our investigation into copy number variations identified alterations in the chr6p21.31-p21.1 region, which harbors several oncogenes with copy number changes directly implicated in tumor progression. In the second PDX model, scRNA-seq identified two therapy-resistant tumor clusters among five detected clusters. The resistant tumor clusters exhibited enrichment of HIF-1, Hippo, and p53 signaling pathways, similar to the first PDX model but also unique activation of pathways like TGF-β and Hippo signaling.



 Our study highlights the dynamic, heterogeneity of RC tumors to CRT, identifying both shared and patient-specific resistance mechanisms in two PDX models. These findings underscore the complexity of RC tumor biology and offer a foundation for developing precision therapies targeting treatment-resistant subclones.

 Despite advancements in medical treatment, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Combination therapies involving multiple targeted agents are increasingly recognized as effective strategies to improve treatment outcomes and overcome the limitations of single-agent therapies. While single-target approaches have shown specificity and potency, they face challenges such as drug resistance, limited pharmacokinetics, and patient adherence. Given the complex nature of HCC, targeting multiple molecular pathways through combination strategies holds promise for more robust therapeutic outcomes.
 Epigenetic therapies offer a distinct advantage in treating HCC by targeting reversible modifications to reprogram aberrant gene expression and address tumor heterogeneity. These therapies can enhance the efficacy of existing treatments, overcome resistance mechanisms, selectively target cancer cells, and modulate the immune microenvironment, making them a promising avenue for improving HCC outcomes.
 EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2) is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), leading to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and the promotion of stem cell-like features. LSD1 (Lysine-specific demethylase 1) is a histone demethylase that modulates gene expression to promote tumor progression, cancer stemness, drug resistance, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These epigenetic enzymes form a corepressor complex to inhibit tumor suppressor gene expression. Both EZH2 and LSD1 are overexpressed in HCC and are strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Patients with high expression levels of both EZH2 and LSD1 exhibit the poorest survival, suggesting that dual inhibition of these enzymes may offer a more effective therapeutic strategy than monotherapy in HCC.
 Dual inhibition of EZH2 and LSD1 using GSK126 (an EZH2 inhibitor) and SP2509 (an LSD1 inhibitor) more effectively suppresses liver cancer cell proliferation compared to single-agent treatments. This combination reduces cell proliferation markers, including PCNA and Cyclin D1, and is associated with enhanced programmed cell death. Additionally, we observed decreased cell migration, invasion potential, cancer stem cell characteristics, and drug resistance. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that high expression of either EZH2 or LSD1 is linked to crucial processes such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cancer stemness, and EMT, reinforcing the potential of dual epigenetic targeting. Although EZH2 and LSD1 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials for various cancers, their combination has not yet been explored in HCC. Therefore, evaluating this dual epigenetic therapy for HCC treatment represents a promising direction for future research with immediate translational potential.

 Numerical chromosomal instability (n-CIN) is a defining characteristic of most human cancers with serious implications of large-scale alterations of the genome - such as chromosome arm level copy number changes. These kinds of somatic alterations are frequently targeting oncogenes and tumor suppressors, enriched in cancer driver events in order to shape the transcriptome in favor of tumor progression and proliferation. While oncogenes are mostly associated with copy number gains and tumor suppressors are more frequent in chromosome arm losses, neighboring genes are also affected in both cases. This collateral damage may be able to create synthetic lethal relationships and context-specific dependencies. Cancer cells might be able to avoid partial loss and gain-related lethal effects by triggering different dose compensation mechanisms, occurring at the genomic, epigenetic and post-translational levels, which leads to deviations across copy number and expression profiles.
 To propose a metric for dose compensation potential, we analyzed copy number and gene expression profiles of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia in order to characterize cancer cell lines with the ability to compensate dependencies arising from chromosomal losses and gains. Our metric consists of the sum of gene expression residuals from linear model fits, describing how much a cell line tends to under or overexpress genes compared to what we expect from copy number counts. By comparing other publicly available datasets with our results, such as perturbation transcriptomics data from the LINCS-L1000 project and the DepMap genome-wide gene essentiality measurements, we aim to identify CIN-related therapeutic vulnerabilities associated with chromosome arm losses and gains. Besides finding potential target candidates, we show that our method is capable of finding well-known pathway-specific compensation mechanisms. As an example, we show a significant correlation between the activity of the Nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway and our proposed compensation potential score (CPS) of cancer cell lines.
 We propose our method to be used to detect context-specific dependencies associated with gene dosage compensation, and also able to provide pathway-level evidence - both novel and previously known from the literature.

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: TIGD1 (Trigger Transposable Element Derived 1) is a recently identified oncogene with largely unexplored biological functions. Emerging evidence suggests its involvement in multiple cellular processes across cancer types. This study aimed to perform a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of TIGD1 to evaluate its expression patterns, diagnostic utility, prognostic value, and association with immunotherapy response and drug resistance. Methods: Transcriptomic and clinical data from TCGA and GTEx were analyzed using various bioinformatic tools. Expression profiling, survival analysis, immune correlation studies, gene set enrichment, single-cell sequencing, and drug sensitivity assessments were performed. Results: TIGD1 was found to be significantly upregulated in various tumor types, with notably high expression in colon adenocarcinoma. Elevated TIGD1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in several cancers. TIGD1 levels correlated with key features of the tumor immune microenvironment, including immune checkpoint gene expression, TMB, and MSI, suggesting a role in modulating anti-tumor immunity. GSEA and single-cell analyses implicated TIGD1 in oncogenic signaling pathways. Furthermore, high TIGD1 expression was linked to resistance to several therapeutic agents, including Zoledronate, Dasatinib, and BLU-667. Conclusions: TIGD1 may serve as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, particularly in colon, gastric, liver, and lung cancers. Its strong associations with immune modulation and therapy resistance highlight its potential as a novel target for precision oncology and immunotherapeutic intervention.">

 Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer and lacks effective therapies. The MDA-MB-231 cell line, derived from TNBC, is used to evaluate new therapeutic strategies. Acetate, a microbial short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), is a key source of acetyl-CoA during metabolic stress and plays a critical role in regulating cancer cell epigenetics and transcriptomics. Acetate’s signaling functions may be a significant factor in cancer growth and progression, however the role of acetate in TNBC remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the effects of acetate on the gene expression of TNBC cells.



 We used MDA-MB-231 as our cell model for TNBC. Cells were then exposed with sodium acetate at a concentration of 5mM or growth media (negative control) for 24 hours in triplicates. After exposure, total RNA was extracted (Qiagen RNAeasy Mini kit) and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq (2 X 75bp). The higher-quality reads were aligned, annotated, and quantified to the human genome (hg38) using STAR and RSEM softwares. Gene expression analysis was performed in R statistical software (packages tximport and DESeq2) and genes with an adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered significant. Functional and enrichment analyses were performed using Metascape (FDR p<0.05).



 There were 1410 differentially expressed genes associated with acetate treatment. Adenylosuccinate lyase (A0A1W2PRX2), a novel described protein, was the highest upregulated gene (log2 fold change: 8.25), while dorsal inhibitory axon guidance protein (DRAXIN) was the most downregulated gene (log2 fold change: -2.70). In addition, there was a significant increase in the levels of kinesin family member 12 (KIF12) and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 1B (PPP1R1B), which have been associated with chemoresistance. Significantly impacted biological processes and pathways include regulation of cell projection organization, response to hormone, chromatin remodeling, cytokine signaling in immune system, signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases, epithelial cell differentiation, response to oxidative stress, and DNA damage response.



 Acetate can promote TNBC cell growth and disease progression via inflammatory mechanisms and lipid metabolism. The observed increase and decrease in A0A1W2PRX2 in DRAXIN expression, respectively, highlight these genes as potential novel therapeutic targets, given their association with breast cancer through oncogenic signaling cascades and apoptosis regulation. Furthermore, upregulation of KIF12 and PPP1R1B suggest that acetate may potentially mediating therapeutic resistance in TNBC. These findings provide insights into microbial metabolic byproducts can impact TNBC progression and suggest that targeting acetate-driven metabolic and signaling pathways may offer innovative strategies for treatment of TNBC.

 Molecularly targeted therapies have significantly improved clinical outcomes by directly addressing oncogenic driver mutations in genes such as EGFR. However, despite their initial success, long-term patient survival remains limited due to the emergence of drug tolerance and resistance. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying drug tolerance in response to targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using single-cell RNA sequencing of oncogene-driven human NSCLCs at the residual disease (RD) state during active targeted therapy, we observed an enrichment of an alveolar type I/II (AT1/2) mixed lineage program in surviving cancer cells, resembling an alveolar cell-like state. This transition is characterized by increased expression of WNT3A/4 ligands, FZD2 receptors, β-catenin signaling, and AT1/2 signatures in RD cells. Consistent with these clinical observations, preclinical models of drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells exhibited elevated AT1/2-like transcriptional signatures and target gene expression associated with β-catenin and YAP signaling. Further analysis revealed the formation of a stable nuclear protein complex between β-catenin and YAP in DTP cells, which appears to play a critical role in sustaining drug tolerance. Disrupting the expression and stability of the β-catenin/YAP complex, either through knockdown of these genes or by using Tankyrase inhibitors (e.g. XAV-939 or IWR1) to regulate the β-catenin destruction complex, re-sensitized DTP cells to the EGFR inhibitor Osimertinib. In xenograft mouse models, the combination of Osimertinib with a Tankyrase inhibitor significantly improved tumor growth inhibition compared to Osimertinib alone. This therapeutic strategy also led to a notable reduction in AT1/2 gene signatures, a decrease in nuclear β-catenin and YAP protein expression, reduced stability of these proteins, and suppression of their interaction, further supporting its potential in overcoming drug tolerance. Additionally, we identified specific domains within both β-catenin and YAP proteins that are essential for their interaction. This interdependence underscores the critical roles of β-catenin and YAP in maintaining DTP cell survival and driving alveolar cell-like lineage plasticity. Our findings shed light on the interplay between β-catenin/YAP signaling and alveolar cell-like lineage signatures in residual cancer states. By targeting this axis, we propose a novel therapeutic approach to overcome drug tolerance and improve clinical outcomes for patients with NSCLC undergoing targeted therapy.

        <tr id="The integrity of the genome is maintained by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins that recognize and repair base mismatches and insertion/deletion errors generated during DNA replication and recombination. A defective MMR system results in genome-wide instability and the progressive accumulation of mutations. Tumors exhibiting deficient MMR (dMMR) and/or high levels of microsatellite instability (termed “microsatellite instability high”, or MSI-H) have been shown to possess fundamental differences in clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics, distinguishing them from their “microsatellite stable” (MSS) counterparts. Molecularly, they are defined by a high mutational burden, genetic instability, and a distinctive immune profile. Their distinct genetic and immunological profiles have made dMMR/MSI-H tumors particularly amenable to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The ongoing development of biomarker-driven therapies and the evaluation of novel combinations of immune-based therapies, with or without the use of conventional cytotoxic treatment regimens, continue to refine treatment strategies with the goals of maximizing therapeutic efficacy and survival outcomes in this distinct patient population. Moreover, the resultant knowledge of the mechanisms by which these features are suspected to render these tumors more responsive, overall, to immunotherapy may provide information regarding the potential optimization of this therapeutic approach in tumors with proficient MMR (pMMR)/MSS tumors.">

 Bladder cancer often harbors driver mutations in genes regulating epigenetic processes, yet their influence on therapeutic perturbations is understudied. One key example is KDM6A, a gene frequently mutated in bladder cancer, which encodes a histone demethylase that confers transcription permissive chromatin state. Retrospective analysis of patient cohorts demonstrated that KDM6A mutations correlate with improved response to immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) and decreased sensitivity to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Mechanistic studies reveal that CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of Kdm6a reduced expression of critical genes including Msh2, Msh6, and Exo1 involved in DNA Mismatch repair (MMR) and double-stranded base repair (DSBR) in tumor cells with improved response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Further, KDM6A deficiency downregulated genes involved in cisplatin resistance and attenuated sensitivity to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, loss of KDM6A was associated with metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. CyTOF analyses show decreased abundance regulatory T cells (Tregs) in Kdm6a-knockout tumors. Importantly, reduced lactate in the Kdm6a-knockout tumor microenvironment impaired histone lactylation (H3K9la/H3K18la) in Tregs with concurrent attenuation of expression of key immunosuppressive genes including Foxp3, Tgfß1 and Pdcd1. Collectively, this study provided insights into the role of KDM6A-mediated epigenetic regulation of DNA repair and metabolic reprogramming which could potentially govern response to chemotherapy and ICT aiding patient stratification and development of personalized treatment algorithms.

 The formation of cancer and responsiveness to therapy is governed by a constantly evolving balance between somatic variation and dynamic epigenetic regulation. This evolution has been recognized as a significant obstacle confronting the development of durable cancer therapies. Thus, targeting epigenetic reprogramming in human cancers is a key focus for the design of new drugs to potentially deliver robust and durable anti-tumor activity. Lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) are a promising class of epigenetic targets that operate within interchangeable multi-subunit complexes to regulate cell cycle, pluripotency and lineage determination. Within this class, KAT6A and KAT7 have been recognized as mechanistically intertwined modulators of stem cell identity and lineage commitment through partially overlapping control of chromatin organization specified by histone H3 acetylation of lysine 23 (H3K23) and lysine 14 (H3K14). We noted multiple lines of orthogonal genetic evidence for a “paralog” relationship between these enzymes to support cancer cell autonomous survival in lineage-enriched subsets of the CCLE associated with predictive molecular features. These observations prompted evaluation of concomitant inhibition of KAT6A and KAT7 as a therapeutic approach in biomarker-defined patient populations. Here, we report an equipotent KAT6/KAT7 dual inhibitor with high selectivity versus the structurally similar KAT family members KAT5 and KAT8. We observed synergistic impact on cell viability and pharmacodynamic (PD) modulation of H3K23/H3K14 acetylation in biomarker positive breast, lung, and esophageal cancers with dual KAT6/7 inhibition versus selective inhibition of KAT6 or KAT7. In vitro transcriptomic evaluation of dual KAT6/7 drug effects in ER+ metastatic breast cancer models recapitulated convergent paralog behavior observed using genetic suppression with RNAi. Quantitative transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of cancer cell responses to dual KAT6/7 inhibition confirmed downregulation of gene expression programs supporting lineage specification, stemness, and WNT signaling. In vivo efficacy studies in 8p11-amplified breast and lung xenografts confirmed enhanced tumor growth inhibition and PD modulation responses for dual KAT6/7 versus selective KAT6 inhibition. Notably, dual KAT6/7 inhibition also promoted improved durable and stable anti-tumor responses in endocrine therapy resistant and ESR1-mutant breast cancer patient derived xenografts that could not be achieved with selective KAT6 inhibition alone. Taken together, these observations support evaluation of dual KAT6/7 inhibition in biomarker-selected patient populations.

        <tr id="Somatic cells can transform into tumors due to mutations, and the tumors further evolve towards increased aggressiveness and therapy resistance. We develop DiffInvex, a framework for identifying changes in selection acting on individual genes in somatic genomes, drawing on an empirical mutation rate baseline derived from non-coding DNA that accounts for shifts in neutral mutagenesis during cancer evolution. We apply DiffInvex to >11,000 somatic whole-genome sequences from ~30 cancer types or healthy tissues, identifying genes where point mutations are under conditional positive or negative selection during exposure to specific chemotherapeutics, suggesting drug resistance mechanisms occurring via point mutation. DiffInvex identifies 11 genes exhibiting treatment-associated selection for different classes of chemotherapies, linking selected mutations in PIK3CA, APC, MAP2K4, SMAD4, STK11 and MAP3K1 with drug exposure. Various gene-chemotherapy associations are further supported by differential functional impact of mutations pre- versus post-therapy, and are also replicated in independent studies. In addition to nominating drug resistance genes, we contrast the genomes of healthy versus cancerous cells of matched human tissues. We identify noncancerous expansion-specific drivers, including NOTCH1 and ARID1A. DiffInvex can also be applied to diverse analyses in cancer evolution to identify changes in driver gene repertoires across time or space.">

Among the key genes involved, genetic variations in the nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) gene affect on thiopurine metabolism, thus influencing drug efficacy and the risk of severe adverse effects, such as myelosuppression, These variations also contribute to inter-individual differences in drug tolerance and clinical outcomes. Despite the recognized impact of NUDT15 variations, there has been limited comprehensive exploration of these variants and their clinical significance in thiopurine therapy. This review provides a thorough analysis of NUDT15 genetic variants by synthesizing findings from prior clinical studies and employing in silico analyses to predict the functional effects of variants with uncertain significance. Comprehensive analysis of NUDT15 variants and their interactions with other metabolic pathways could offer valuable insights for advancing personalized medicine in cancer treatment. This review aims to establish a foundation for integrating NUDT15 genetic information into the clinical practice, reducing toxicity, and improved therapeutic outcomes in patients undergoing thiopurine-based chemotherapy.">

 Werner helicase inhibitors (WRNi) are in clinical development for treating patients with microsatellite-unstable (MSI) tumors characterized by defective DNA mismatch repair. Here, we investigate the impact of cancer cell evolutionary adaptation on WRN pharmacological inhibition with implications for understanding drug selectivity and potential clinical resistance. Coupling genome-wide CRISPR screens with WRN gene knockout, no suppressors of WRN dependency were identified, underscoring WRN’s essential non-redundant function in MSI cells. Pharmacogenomic screens pinpointed modulators of WRNi sensitivity, including SMARCAL1, linking it to WRN-MSI synthetic lethality. Semi-saturation mutagenesis of WRN and prolonged drug treatment identified on-target WRN mutations driving acquired resistance to multiple WRNi in vitro and in vivo. Specific resistance mutations induce cross-resistance to WRN inhibitors, whereas others preserve sensitivity to alternative WRNi. Our work guides next-generation strategies for targeting MSI cancers, enabling cross-resistance studies to evaluate current and novel WRNi efficacy and informing future clinical trial design.

 Reconstructing cell division lineages across generations is central to understanding developmental biology, cancer progression, cell differentiation, drug resistance, and tissue aging. By integrating CRISPR-Cas9 induced gene editing with single cell RNA-Seq, high-resolution lineage tracing through molecular barcoding becomes feasible. However, tracking mutation evolution across successive guide RNA edits, especially with homing guide RNA (hgRNA) technology, poses challenges due to ongoing dynamic retargeting and genetic modifications that complicate lineage reconstruction.



 To overcome these challenges, we developed LINMAP, a computational framework that applies machine learning to trace and map evolving mutations across cell divisions, reconstructing intermediate histories. LINMAP calculates mutation transition probabilities at each division to identify potential paths for mutation accumulation and defines cell-cell distances based on these transition probabilities, enabling precise division count measurements between cell pairs.



 We created an MMTV-PyMT (mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle tumor-antigen)-Cas9 tracing cell line with dual hgRNAs to investigate mutation evolution networks. LINMAP accurately inferred mutation evolution and predicted allele frequencies, aligning well with both in vitro data from MMTV-PyMT cell lines and computational simulations. Moreover, in a separate in silico experiment simulating lineage history from a progenitor, LINMAP reconstructed the cell division lineage with high precision. Applying LINMAP to a CRISPR-Cas9 lineage-traced lung cancer mouse model, we successfully traced tumors of varying clonality within a single mouse. Based on lineage characteristics, LINMAP differentiated tumors, reconstructed their complete lineage, and identified each tumor’s monoclonal or polyclonal origins. It recreated a timeline of tumor emergence and tracked cell state transitions, capturing cell state shifts during cancer progression. These findings aligned with gene expression-based cell state trajectories from the original study, further validating LINMAP's accuracy.



 LINMAP integrates mutation ratios and transition probabilities at each cell division, surpassing precision than existing methods. It enables comprehensive single cell lineage tracing, providing insights into tumor evolution and complexity, tracking tumor development, distinguishing metastatic sites from primary tumors, and studying drug resistance through subclonal selection over time.

        <tr id="Despite the general detriment of aneuploidy to cellular fitness, >90% of solid tumors carry an imbalanced karyotype. This existing paradox and the molecular responses to aneuploidy remain poorly understood. Here, we explore these cellular stresses and unique vulnerabilities of aneuploidy in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) enriched for breast cancer-associated copy number alterations (CNAs). To uncover the genetic dependencies specific to aneuploid cells, we conducted a comprehensive, genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in isogenic aneuploid and diploid HMEC lines. Our study reveals that aneuploid HMECs exhibit an increased reliance on pyrimidine biosynthesis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes and demonstrate heightened fitness advantages upon loss of tumor suppressor genes. Using an integrative multiomic analysis, we confirmed nucleotide pool insufficiency as a key contributor to widespread cellular dysfunction in aneuploid HMECs with net copy number gain. Although diploid cells can switch seamlessly between pyrimidine synthesis and salvage, cells with increased chromosomal content exhibit p53 activation and S-phase arrest when relying on salvage alone, alongside increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics. This work advances our understanding of the consequences of aneuploidy and uncovers potential avenues for patient stratification and therapeutic intervention based on tumor ploidy.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a treatment-refractory malignancy with a dismal prognosis. Targeting cancer cell plasticity—the capacity to adapt to cell-extrinsic pressure via non-genetic mechanisms—is a promising therapeutic strategy, yet cell states within PDAC harboring high plasticity remain poorly understood. Using genetically engineered mouse models driven by oncogenic KrasG12D and loss of p53 (“KPC” model), we profiled primary PDAC tumors using single-cell RNA sequencing and single cell ATAC sequencing. We find that the KPC model harbors a basal state, which harbors transcriptional signature that aligns with the “basal” signature in human PDAC and is linked to poor prognosis and chemoresistance. The basal state co-expresses both epithelial and mesenchymal programs and has a distinct epigenetic landscape with accessible chromatin across gene sets that mark cancer cell states with divergent phenotypes, suggesting that this cell state is primed for cell state switching. To functionally interrogate the basal state in PDAC progression, we developed a novel lineage-tracing and ablation system. Lineage-tracing experiments revealed that the basal state has a robust capacity for differentiation into epithelial and mesenchymal states, indicating that the basal state is functionally plastic and acts as a source of fixed malignant states. Strikingly, targeted elimination of the basal state over short time periods resulted in tumor collapse, underscoring a critical role in tumor maintenance. Further, we found that the basal state is highly dependent on KRAS activity, with acute KRAS inhibitor treatment leading to a selective depletion of the basal state. Taken together, our data indicates that PDAC harbors a striking dependency on the basal state and encourages therapeutic approaches aimed at eradicating this critical subset of cancer cells.

 Dynamic adaptations in cancer cell-state due to therapy is a growing concern. Despite multimodal clinical therapy, tumor cells surpass treatment resulting in frequent relapses in rapidly decreasing timeline. We have shown that, in accordance with therapy pressure associated tumor microenvironment, progressive disease (PD) cells exhibit reversible lineage transformation and unparalleled plasticity. However, our understanding of the genetic determinant(s) and/ or mechanism(s) that coordinate cancer cell plasticity is a far reach. Herein, we investigated the crucial cancer cell phenotypic switching in response to therapy pressure. Using a panel of 14 well characterized human neuroblastoma (NB) cells derived during diagnosis (Dx) and PD, we investigated the association of retinal degeneration protein 3 (RD3) status (ELISA) to their migratory and invasive capabilities (transwell assay), clonal expansion (BrDu), EMT (E-CAD, N-CAD, Vimentin, SLUG), metastatic state (Ron-β, MMP-9, MMP-2), stemness maintenance (CD133, CD117, CD114, Oct3/4, Sox2, NANOG, CD54, NOTCH1) and cellular dedifferentiation (β-3 tubulin, NF-L, GFAP, GAP43) (immunoblotting). Further, to investigate the function of RD3 in coordinating cancer cell plasticity, we utilized six select NB cells, three derived during Dx and three derived during PD, representing both primary and metastatic tumors. These patient derived cells were reverse engineered for stable expression of RD3 in RD3- PD cell lines; stable silencing of RD3 in RD3+ Dx cell lines and were subjected to end-point readouts as above. RD3 loss in PD correlated with the increased cellular migration, invasion, metastatic potential, EMT and stemness maintenance. Directed simulation experiments with stable restoration and silencing systems clearly identified the function of RD3-loss in cancer cell plasticity by regulating stemness (ALDH, CD133), EMT (Vimentin, E-CAD, N-CAD), metastasis (Ron-β, MMP-9), pluripotency maintenance (Oct3/4, Sox2, NANOG), dedifferentiation (β-3 tubulin, NF-H, GFAP, GAP43) and clonal expansion (BrDu). Our findings for the first time identified the defined function and relevance of RD3 in regulating cancer cell EMT, stemness and pluripotency maintenance, metastatic state and prompting differentiation. Crucially, our findings recognized therapy pressure directed RD3 loss dictates cancer cell lineage transformation to cancer stem cells. These outcomes together pave way to develop novel and effective molecular-targeted maintenance therapeutic strategy for patients presented with therapy defying progressive disease.

 SCLC is the deadliest type of lung cancer, which is mostly diagnosed at late stages and accounts for 15% of pulmonary tumors. Chemotherapy is initially effective, but SCLC patients relapse quickly and develop resistant tumors. Large-scale studies uncovered key molecular patterns in SCLC, which include universal loss of TP53 and RB1, as well as transcriptional patterns based on the expression of 4 lineage transcription factors (TF). We aimed to dissect how genomic cues impact transcriptional phenotypes, and the dynamics of tumor and immune cell interactions, to thus decipher molecular mechanisms of phenotypic divergence in SCLC.
 We performed genome and single cell transcriptome profiling on 56 SCLC patient tumors, including primary tumors, metastases and paired relapse tumors, including a patient sample after treatment with DLL3-targeted immunotherapy. Single cell RNA-seq was performed with the 10x Genomics platform to study cancer cells and the tumor micro-environment (TME), and tumor cell intrinsic heterogeneity. Data were processed with an in-house pipeline.
 Single cell expression profiles were determined for > 200000 cells from 56 tumors. Transcriptome profiling at single cell levels revealed co-expression of at least two of the lineage TF ASCL1, NEUROD1 or POU2F3 for each SCLC tumor. Transcriptional profiles pointed to a marked intra- and interpatient, as well as to inter-metastatic heterogeneity. Cell-cell-interaction analysis across all samples uncovered recurrent patterns of intra-tumoral receptor-ligand interactions. The integrative analysis of genome and single cell transcriptome data pointed to somatic alterations and copy number alterations shaping transcriptional heterogeneity. Specifically, tumors with gene amplifications of MYC family members share similar expression profiles. We performed multi-regional and longitudinal studies of matched patient cases to project genomic patterns of clonal evolution to transcriptional profiles at single cell level, thus analyzing the effect of genome diversity on the transcriptional landscape. Additionally, tumor intrinsic profiles of heterogeneity were mapped to single cell data of patient tumors to elucidate the effects on tumor-immune cell interactions.
 Altogether we provide a first comprehensive framework for the study of underlying genetic alterations that shape the transcriptional landscape and phenotypic plasticity in SCLC. Our data points to a concerted regulation of a multitude of factors including lineage TF, transcriptional programs and interaction networks in SCLC.

        <tr id="Cancer development requires an evolutionary transformation from mammalian cells fully regulated by and integrated into multicellular tissue to cancer cells that, as single cell protists, are individually subject to Darwinian selection. Through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance, the evolving cancer phenotype must acquire independence from host controls, downregulate differentiated functions that benefit the host but not individual cells, and generate phenotypic traits that increase fitness in the context of the selection forces within the local microenvironment. Here, we investigate this evolutionary transition in breast (BRCA) and lung (LUAD, without EGFR, KRAS or BRAF driver mutations) adenocarcinomas using bulk mutation and expression data from the TCGA database. We define evolution selection for genes and molecular pathways based on 1) changes in gene expression compared to normal tissue, and 2) significantly larger or smaller observed mutation rates compared to those expected based on the gene size. We find BRCA and LUAD disable different genes and gene pathways associated with tissue-specific signaling and differentiated functions but promote common molecular pathways associated with cell cycle, cell-cell interactions, cytoskeleton, voltage gated ion channels, and microenvironmental niche construction. Thus, tissue-specific parallel evolution in early cancer development is followed by convergence to a common cancer phenotype.">

 DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) genes’ (including MSH3) alterations through silencing and/or mutations plays a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) carcinogenesis. MSH3 interacts with MSH2 to form MutSβ, which recognizes and directs repair of insertion/deletion loops during in DNA replication; deficiencies lead to elevated mutation rates. Msh3 alterations are associated with instability at tetranucleotide repeats (termed Elevated Microsatellite Alterations at Selected Tetranucleotide repeats, EMAST), a phenotype elevated frequency among African American (AA). CRCs and associated with poor patient prognosis. Aim: To assess functional impact of 3 out of 4 Exomes (E) E20, E-21, E22, E23 novel deleterious AA variants within the ATPase domain of MSH3.



 We used CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in and successfully introduced 3 of these mutations (confirmed by Sanger sequencing) in Msh3 ATPase domain (c.G2926A, c.C3028T, c.G3241A) in SW620 colon cancer cell line (carry Msh3 gene wild-type). In Silico and wet-lab MSH3 functional analysis was performed. We used MTT for cell proliferation, tetranucleotide repeats instability assays, immunofluorescence for MSH3 localization, Western blot for protein expression, co-immunoprecipitation for MSH3 interaction with MSH2 MMR protein, and thin layer chromatography ATPase assays with purified MutSβ complexes.



 In silico analysis showed deleterious effect of the 4 novel msh3 mutants. However, biological phenotypic assays revealed no observable changes in cell morphology or proliferation between wild-type and MSH3-variant knocked-in cells, with no EMAST after 7 to 10 passages. Subcellular localization of variant MSH3 was unaffected compared to wild type MSH3, and interaction between mutant MSH3 and MSH2 proteins was not impacted, However, the ATPase activity of two of the variant MutSβ complexes was affected. MSH3 c.G2759T (E20) exhibited overall reduced ATPase activity compared to wildtype and was not affected by the presence of DNA. MSH3 c.C3028T (E22) exhibited elevated ATPase activity compared to wildtype in the presence of specific (loop) or non-specific DNA (homoduplex).



 Despite computational deleterious predictions, novel MSH3 variants identified from AA CRCs appeared to show no biological or genetic evidence of pathogenicity, but did reveal altered in vitro biochemical properties. Altered MutSβ ATPase activity, both decreased and increased, has been shown to disrupt proper MMR activity. We propose that disruptions in the ATP hydrolytic cycle contribute to MMR deficiency, resulting in elevated mutation rates with contribution to colorectal cancer pathogenesis. This effect may be enhanced in distinct genetic backgrounds, and directly affect cancer cells’ proliferation and cell division.

 Clear Cell Sarcoma (CCSA) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma characterized by specific gene fusions EWSR1::ATF1 or EWSR1::CREB1, leading to the expression of an oncogenic fusion protein. Metastasized CCSA is resistant to conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy. This study aims to uncover new therapeutic strategies for CCSA by utilizing a whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screen combined with functional drug screening.



 We performed a genome-wide knock-out screen in the CCSA cell line model KAS using the pooled Brunello sgRNA library (Addgene # 73178, ∼4 guides/gene, 19'114 genes). In parallel, three CCSA patient samples and multiple CCSA cell lines (SU-CCS-1, DTC-1, KAS) were treated with a library of 84 solid tumor pan-cancer drugs, and a custom drug library tailored to the hits of the CRISPR screen (70 compounds). Genes identified as critical vulnerabilities in CCSA were validated through single-gene knockouts, and promising therapeutic targets were further mechanistically interrogated and evaluated in a CCSA xenograft model.



 Results revealed 1'552 significantly depleted genes (log fold change <-1 and FDR < 0.01) after 21 days, with enriched pathways in proteasome activity, mismatch repair, DNA replication, and, mTORC1 signaling, revealing critical vulnerabilities. Notable highly ranked depleted genes include the transcription factor and CCSA marker SOX10, as well as MDM2, MCL1, CHEK1, HSPA5, PSMA5 and mTOR. Through integration of genetic knock-out and pharmacological inhibition data identified in our dual screening, we were able to identify several overlapping vulnerabilities. Initial validation of the therapeutic potential of PI3K/mTOR inhibition in CCSA cell models in vitro revealed an induction of apoptosis upon treatment. We then corroborated those findings in a CCSA xenograft mouse model in vivo. Treatment with the two combined PI3K/mTOR inhibitors omipalisib and copanlisib both resulted in significantly improved survival (P = 0.027 and P = 0.036, respectively) of tumor bearing mice, and reduced tumor growth, each compared to vehicle treatment.



 These findings offer new insights into actionable vulnerabilities in CCSA, with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors showing potential for therapeutic development. Future studies will investigate synergistic combinations to further optimize treatment efficacy and validate further vulnerabilities identified by our dual screening approach.

 The deregulation of BCL2 family proteins is a key contributor to the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Pharmacological inhibition of these proteins, particularly through the BCL2-specific inhibitor venetoclax, has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach. However, the clinical efficacy of venetoclax is often compromised due to primary and acquired resistance mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. We employed a deep tabular learning algorithm to develop a drug sensitivity prediction model using T-ALL patient samples. Our findings revealed distinct expression profiles between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant samples. Specifically, in the context of venetoclax sensitivity and resistance phenotypes, we observed associations with several key proteins regulating the cell cycle, cytokine signaling, and mitochondrial apoptosis. Our data suggest a key link between lipid metabolism and beta-catenin signaling, which may cooperate with transcription factors regulating the transcriptional activation of key apoptosis regulatory genes. Together, our results underscore the complexity of therapy resistance and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting multiple pathways for growth inhibition. Future research should focus on clinical trials exploring this combinatorial approach to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes in T-ALL.

This study aimed to identify commonly mutated genes and altered pathways in canine solid tumors. Four dogs with different types of naturally occurring neoplasias (urothelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma) were randomly selected and classified into carcinoma and sarcoma groups based on histopathological findings. Tumor tissues were analyzed using whole-genome sequencing, and significant variants shared within each tumor group were identified. Gene set enrichment analyses were conducted to compare the biological and functional pathways altered by the mutations in each carcinoma and sarcoma group. Forty-three and fifty-eight genes were identified in the carcinoma and sarcoma groups, respectively. Distinctions between the two tumor groups were noted for mutations related to tumor metastatic function. Mutations were identified in genes encoding cell adhesion molecules in the carcinoma group, whereas significant variations in extracellular matrix-related molecules were evident in the sarcoma group. This study revealed mutations and modified pathways associated with immune and tumor metastatic functions in canine carcinoma and sarcoma, indicating their significant relevance to the development and progression of each tumor group. Additionally, the distinctions indicated that different therapeutic approaches were required for each tumor group.">

        <tr id="Inhibition of the mutant BRAFV600E protein in melanoma via targeted therapy causes many cells to die, but resistant populations emerge that are refractory to further treatments. Strategies to target resistance have proven difficult to find, which could be explained by the potential heterogeneity of the population. It is assumed that genetic mutations alone cause resistance, but targeting such mutations has met with limited success in melanoma. Work from our lab and others has now established that non-genetic variability also leads to resistance in vitro and in vivo: we have shown that rare clonal cells, marked by differences in gene expression, survive and form resistant colonies. We recently demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that individual resistant colonies have distinct morphological and transcriptional differences, even with a clonal parent population. These results provide a potential explanation for the difficulty in identifying effective second-line therapies: individual resistant types may have different drug susceptibilities, so an effective second-line drug would have to kill all resistant types at once.
 These findings raise the possibility that there may be therapeutic vulnerabilities to exploit that are invisible in the conventional view of homogeneous resistance. For instance, drug A could kill half of the resistant population while drug B kills the other half. These drugs alone would not be viable second-line treatments, but together they could be highly effective, greatly expanding the pool of drugs that could combat resistance. However, screens to evaluate all combinations of potential drugs would be prohibitively large. This search space could be simplified by determining the drug sensitivities of individual resistant types and using those drugs in combination to eliminate a larger proportion of the total resistant population. However, such per-type classification has not yet been performed in melanoma.
 We generated clonal cell lines from individual resistant colonies, screening four and the drug-naive line using a library of ∼2200 drugs and small molecules with known pathways and targets in cancers. These genetically identical resistant lines indeed had distinct drug sensitivity profiles, and therapy-resistant lines as a whole had novel sensitivities and resistances compared to the drug-naive line. Treating drug-naive cells with targeted therapy in combination with drugs that kill resistant lines can reduce or eliminate resistance, even when the candidate second-line drugs alone do not kill drug-naive cells. Using a panel of 24 drugs identified as of interest in our initial screens, we screened 13 resistant lines, including the original four and four resistant to a different targeted therapy. We found potential links between the transcriptional and toxicity profiles of resistant colonies, and are continuing to test pairs of drugs that kill distinct fractions of the resistant population.

 Breast cancer (BC), the most common cancer globally and a leading cause of death in women, often utilizes radiation therapy (RT) as part of treatment, with over 85% of patients receiving RT after breast-conserving surgery. Still, over 15% of women experience local recurrence despite RT, underscoring the need to better understand the molecular mechanisms driving RT response and resistance. We hypothesized that transcriptomic changes that occur after ionizing radiation in intrinsically radiosensitive and resistant BC models would offer mechanistic insight into mediators of this differential response. To test this, we conducted in vitro and in vivo RNA-seq experiments to characterize transcriptomic changes following RT across a panel of BC cell lines of varying levels of intrinsic radiation sensitivity. Furthermore, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPRi screen to identify genes which are critical to radiation survival and drive radioresistance.



 Eight BC cell lines representing all intrinsic subtypes were treated with 4 Gy RT and RNA was collected 24 hours after treatment for RNA-seq. For 2 cell lines, we also conducted in vivo mouse xenograft experiments in which mice received fractionated daily RT (6 fractions of 2 Gy each). Differential gene expression analysis with DeSeq2 was performed, followed by pathway analysis with Advaita Bioinformatics’ iPathwayGuide. For the CRISPRi experiments, we used the Dolcetto library in two TNBC cell lines: BT-549 and HCC-1937. Cells were transfected with the library and then treated with 3 fractions of 3 Gy RT. DNA was isolated for sequencing after 7 days and analyzed with MaGeCK to determine sgRNA abundance.



 An average of 935 differentially expressed genes were noted in the in vitro models (S.D. 906); 142 and 324 were found in the in vivo models. Among the most highly enriched pathways from the transcriptomic data in both resistant and sensitive cell lines after RT, we found processes including cell cycle, cellular senescence, and estrogen signaling. Pathways uniquely differentially expressed in the in vivo samples for both cell lines include IL-17 signaling and transcriptional misregulation in cancer. From the CRISPRi screen, we identified genes involved in similar pathways, as well as canonical regulators of DNA damage response.



 Ionizing radiation induces transcriptomic expression changes that differ between intrinsically radiosensitive and resistant BC models. These data, coupled with results from the CRISPRi radiosensitivity screen, identify pathways that offer potential insight into the mechanisms underlying intrinsic radioresistance and suggest biologic vulnerabilities that may be targeted to more effectively treat women at a high risk of local BC recurrence. Ongoing studies are exploring the potential of therapeutic targeting of these pathways when combined with RT in breast cancer.

From this massive dataset, we computed 1.678 million sets of up- and down-regulated genes. These gene sets are served for search by the LINCS L1000 Signature Search (L2S2) web server application. With L2S2, users can identify small molecules and single gene CRISPR KOs that produce gene expression profiles similar or opposite to their submitted single or up/down gene sets. L2S2 also includes a consensus search feature that ranks perturbations across all cellular contexts, time points, and concentrations. To demonstrate the utility of L2S2, we crossed the L2S2 gene sets with gene sets collected for the RummaGEO resource. The analysis identified clusters of differentially expressed genes that match drug classes, tissues, and diseases, pointing to many opportunities for drug repurposing and drug discovery. Overall, the L2S2 web server application can be used to further the development of personalized therapeutics while expanding our understanding of complex human diseases.

        <tr id="Chemotherapeutic resistance is a major obstacle to chemotherapeutic failure. Cancer cell resistance involves several mechanisms, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), signaling pathway bypass, drug efflux activation, and impairment of drug entry. P-glycoproteins (P-gp) are an efflux transporter that pumps chemotherapeutic drugs out of cancer cells, resulting in chemotherapeutic resistance. Several types of long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) have been identified in resistant cancer cells, including ODRUL, MALAT1, and ANRIL. The high expression level of ODRUL is related to the induction of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) gene expression, resulting in the emergence of doxorubicin resistance in osteosarcoma. lncRNAs are observed to be regulators of drug transporters in cancer cells such as MALAT1 and ANRIL. Targeting P-gp expression using natural products is a new strategy to overcome cancer cell resistance and improve the sensitivity of resistant cells toward chemotherapies. This review validates the inhibitory effects of natural products on P-gp expression and activity using in silico molecular docking. In silico analysis showed that Delphinidin and Asparagoside-f are the most significant natural product inhibitors of p-glycoprotein-1. These inhibitors can reverse multi-drug resistance and induce the sensitivity of resistant cancer cells toward chemotherapy based on in silico molecular docking. It is important to validate that pre-elementary docking can be confirmed using in vitro and in vivo experimental data.">

        <tr id="Background Two genes are synthetically lethal if loss of function of either one of the two genes does not result in cell death, whereas loss of function of both genes together results in being detrimental to cell survival. This concept has been the basis for developing personalized, precision treatments, which can selectively damage tumor cells and minimize toxicity to normal tissues. Tumor cells often harbor mutations in genes involved in DNA repair pathways, forcing them to switch to alternative repair pathways, leading to chemotherapeutic resistance. These interactions, if targeted, could be synthetically lethal. We aimed to summarize synthetically lethal gene pairs that could be utilized to selectively target cancer cells and minimize side effects on normal tissues. The objective of this review is to study druggable synthetically lethal gene pairs for targeted cancer therapy that have been identified through various genetic screens and functional studies. Methods A systematic literature search will be conducted to extract synthetically lethal gene pairs that can be specifically targeted to cancer cells. Owing to the relatively recent research pertaining to this field, the literature search will incorporate data from 1956. The search will be conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus. The narrative approach will guide the analysis and synthesis of the results. Discussion This review highlights scientific articles that report druggable synthetically lethal gene pairs by testing the efficacy of targeted inhibitors in clonogenic assays. These include research studies that identify synthetically lethal gene pairs detected through CRISPR screens by knocking out one or two genes within the same cell and testing the potency of inhibitors to specifically kill malignant cells.

        <tr id="
 PAX5 is known to be frequently mutated in childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) via several molecular mechanisms, including chimeric fusion, focal deletion, and point mutations. Among these, patients with PAX5 internal tandem duplication (PAX5-ITD) are reported to have a poor outcome. Unlike other common ITDs (e.g., FLT3), PAX5-ITD often involves gain of more than one copy of involved exons, and the exact nature of these alterations remain elusive. Here we aim to investigate the following questions: 1) what are the typical copy number gains in DNA and RNA among PAX5-ITD cases? 2) are PAX5-ITD always in-frame? 3) are these aberrations a result of multi-step or single-step events? Short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and PacBio ISO-seq, a state-of-the-art long-read sequencing method, are used in this study. By integrative analysis of WGS and RNA-seq data from a relapse cohort (n=584) and a non-relapse cohort (n=1055), we identified PAX5 mutation rate of ∼30% in relapsed patients versus that of ∼20% in non-relapsed patients. Among the various PAX5 mutation types, the PAX5-ITD mutation shows the greatest degree of enrichment (P=3e-6) in relapsed patients (n=21), compared with those who remain in remission (n=5). Copy number gains in PAX5-ITD cases ranged from 3 to 25 and involved four exon combinations within the gene: E5, E3-E5, E2-E5 and E1-E5 and concordant copy number gains were detected between diagnosis tumor and relapse tumor. We observed a negative correlation between the number of copy gains and the length of duplicated genomic regions. Furthermore, 11 out of the 26 PAX5-ITD cases exhibited multiple structural variants (SVs) and 1 case harbored 2 somatic SNV in ITD region. To investigate the transcriptional consequences of these SV events, we performed ISO-seq on 7 PAX5-ITD cases with available specimen. By mapping SVs and SNVs to full-length RNA transcripts, we observed complex sequences of events driving the formation of ultimate PAX5-ITD in 3 cases. Besides, copy number analysis on full-length RNA transcripts revealed variable copy number gains within tumors due to alternative splicing. Additionally, we identified neo-splice sites in 2 cases, indicating that the splicing process was influenced by the altered DNA context created by SVs. Finally, our data indicated that all PAX5-ITDs can transcribe in-frame mRNAs, suggesting activating nature of these mutations. These findings provide valuable insights into the genomic complexity of PAX5-ITD and highlight the diverse transcriptional and splicing outcomes due to these alterations.

        <tr id="In recent years, synthetic lethality has become an important theme in the field of targeted cancer therapy. Synthetic lethality refers to simultaneous defects in two or more genes leading to cell death, whereas defects in any single gene do not lead to cell death. Taking advantage of the genetic vulnerability that exists within cancer cells, it theoretically has no negative impact on healthy cells and has fewer side effects than non-specific chemotherapy. Currently, targeted cancer therapies focus on inhibiting key pathways in cancer. However, it has been found that over-activation of oncogenic-related signaling pathways can also induce cancer cell death, which is a major breakthrough in the new field of targeted therapies. In this review, we summarize the conventional gene targets in synthetic lethality (PARP, ATR, ATM, WEE1, PRMT) and provide an in-depth analysis of their latest potential mechanisms. We explore the impact of over-activation of pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and WNT on cancer cell survival, and present the technical challenges of current research. Important theoretical foundations and insights are provided for the application of synthetic lethal strategies in cancer therapy, as well as future research directions.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Esophageal cancer is a major global health concern, particularly the subtype known as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which is commonly treated with the chemotherapy drug 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). However, resistance to 5-FU remains a significant challenge that limits treatment effectiveness. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology to identify genes involved in 5-FU resistance in ESCC cells. We found that the loss of the PFKFB3 gene enhances resistance to 5-FU through different molecular pathways in various cell lines. These findings offer new insights into the biological behavior of ESCC and may help predict which patients are more likely to develop resistance to 5-FU. This knowledge could support the development of more personalized and effective treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="RET-fusion-driven lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) are a rare and particularly aggressive subtype of lung cancer, often affecting young, non-smoker populations. While selective RET-TKI therapies are initially highly effective, they often fail to provide durable responses, with resistance mechanisms emerging over time. Notably, approximately 40% of patients exhibit resistance mechanisms that remain unidentified. To uncover these unknown mechanisms, we performed a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of clinical samples from patients with RET-fusion lung cancers before and after RET-TKI treatment. RNA sequencing analysis revealed inactivation of RB1 and upregulation of DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways in resistant tumors relative to TKI-sensitive samples. Accordingly, methylome analysis confirmed hypomethylation of E2F targets and DDR pathways, suggesting that their transcriptomic upregulation is mainly driven by epigenetic changes. We hypothesized that DDR pathway upregulation was a result of inhibition of Rb1 during TKI treatment. To validate this, we knocked down Rb1 or overexpressed of E2F, and confirmed upregulation of key DDR genes such as BRCA1, MSH6, and Rad18 in RET cell lines. To validate the role of DDR pathways in resistance, we established isogenic cell lines by overexpressing or knocking out BRCA1, MSH6, and Rad18, and conducted drug-tolerant persister (DTP) assays. Genetic inhibition of each of these DDR proteins significantly reduced the generation of DTPs after high dose treatment with the RET-TKI selpercatinib (4.5 uM) while overexpression increased the number of DTPs. We next evaluated the inhibition of XPO1, an exportin protein linked to DDR pathway activation, as a strategy to target DTPs. Treatment with selinexor, an FDA-approved XPO1 inhibitor, in combination with selpercatinib strongly reduced the number of DTPs in vitro, and overexpression of the DDR genes BRCA1, MSH6, and Rad18 rescued this effect. In vivo experiments using RET-driven patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models confirmed that treatment with combination of selpercatinib with selinexor significantly delayed tumor relapse in TKI-sensitive PDX models (n=4) and resensitized resistant PDX tumors to selpercatinib (n=2). Our research highlights DDR pathways as a critical mechanism of resistance via Rb1 inactivation in TKI-treated RET-driven lung cancers and identifies XPO1 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome this resistance. Finally, we also found upregulation of DDR proteins upon treatment with lorlatinib and osimertinib in ALK and EGFR driven LUAD PDXs, respectively, suggesting that targeting DDR pathways could be an effective strategy against resistance in a pan-TKI setting across other RTK-driven LUADs.

        <tr id="In recent years, targeted therapies have become the standard of care for refractory/relapsed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Although the mutational profile of MCL has been extensively studied, there is a lack of understanding of resistance mechanisms and genetic factors that impact the response to novel treatments. Since patients relapsing on targeted treatment experience poor clinical outcomes, understanding the genetic foundation of resistance mechanisms in MCL is essential. In this study, we aimed to scrutinize the copy number profile and clonal dynamics of double-resistant MCL patients treated sequentially with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) and venetoclax using low-coverage whole genome sequencing (lcWGS). Samples obtained after systemic therapy showed more copy number alterations (CNAs) (p = 0.039; Wilcoxon) compared to samples collected before treatment initiation. Patients showing early progression on BTKi demonstrated CNAs affecting cytobands encompassing the coding regions of NOTCH1, TRAF2, BIRC2, BIRC3, and ATM. A deletion in chromosome 9p21.3 was identified in two out of three venetoclax-resistant patients. For patient MCL2, progressing on ibrutinib but showing venetoclax resistance, a 9p21.3 deletion was found throughout the disease course, with acquired SMARCA4-del(19)(p13.3-q13.11) and DLC1-del(8)(p23.2-q11.1) observed at relapse, highlighting their role in disease progression and therapy resistance. Using lcWGS, an innovative genome-wide approach, this study revealed novel putative primary and acquired resistance mechanisms in BTKi and venetoclax double-resistant MCL patients. © 2025 The Author(s).

 Over 50% of melanomas are driven by BRAFV600 mutations. Clinically, targeted inhibitors of mutant BRAF and MEK are the primary treatment for more than 50% of melanoma patients that are refractory to standard-of-care immunotherapy. While targeted therapies are initially clinically effective, a subset of residual cancer cells persist and inevitably drive tumor recurrence and drug resistance. While some cells persist due to pre-existing mechanisms (e.g. genetic mutations), others can non-genetically adapt to tolerate drug by rewiring their internal signaling cascades. Importantly, a key feature of these non-genetically adapted persister cells is that their drug-tolerant phenotype is acquired in response to drug pressure, making them extremely challenging to identify and characterize.
 Using cutting-edge long-term time-lapse microscopy and an automated single-cell tracking pipeline, we studied the behaviors of persister cells in drug-treated BRAFV600E melanoma populations. Notably, we found significant heterogeneity within persister populations. While all persister cells initially enter a state of drug-induced quiescence, a subset of these cells—termed “escapees”—can escape drug action and resume proliferation. By computationally reconstructing single-cell lineages from long-term time-lapse imaging experiments, we monitored key signaling pathways before, during, and after escape from drug. Using this approach, we identified a significant increase in mTorC1 signaling activity in persisters that would go on to escape drug. Additionally, mTorC1 signaling caused increases in protein translation and cell growth rates during the quiescent periods of these cells.
 The abundance of Cyclin D1, a key driver of proliferation, is extremely sensitive to cellular translation rates due to its short half-life. In order to determine if the observed increase in mTorC1-mediated growth and translation is driving the upregulation of Cyclin D1 levels past a threshold necessary for escape, we used CRISPR to tag Cyclin D1 at the endogenous locus. Importantly, we found that escapees significantly upregulate Cyclin D1 levels in the hours prior to their escape, compared to non-escapees. These findings have important clinical implications because they suggest that Cyclin D1 protein levels are a key bottleneck for cell-cycle re-entry under MAPK inhibition. Additionally, these findings implicate Cyclin D1 as one of the first markers that can distinguish future escapees from non-escapees in the quiescence period before these distinct cell-cycle fates emerge.

 The early detection and characterization of rare cellular populations in preneoplastic lesions are crucial for understanding cancer initiation and progression, as well as for identifying novel therapeutic targets. Rare cell populations, often overlooked due to their low abundance, play pivotal roles in shaping the tumor microenvironment and driving disease development. In this study, we employed a lineage tracing system based on tracing vectors introduced into a 2D cell line model of esophageal preneoplasia. This approach allowed us to track genetic perturbations that accumulate during cell proliferation, enabling precise identification of distinct cellular lineages. By coupling this lineage tracing method with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we achieved high-resolution transcriptomic profiling, uncovering rare cellular populations with unique molecular and lineage-specific characteristics. The rare populations identified through this integrated approach exhibited a quiescent phenotype, suggesting their involvement in lesion persistence and resistance to therapies targeting proliferative cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct genetic signatures and key pathways associated with these populations, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention and biomarker development. Our findings demonstrate the value of combining genetic perturbation-based lineage tracing with scRNA-seq to uncover rare and functionally significant cellular populations. This study provides new insights into the cellular dynamics underlying esophageal cancer initiation and progression, laying the groundwork for future research aimed at understanding the roles of these populations and developing targeted therapies.

        <tr id="Abstract Adenosine base editors (ABEs) facilitate A·T to G·C base pair conversion with significant therapeutic potential for correcting pathogenic point mutations in human genetic diseases, such as sickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia. Unlike CRISPR–Cas9 systems that induce double-strand breaks, ABEs operate through precise deamination, avoiding chromosomal instability. However, the off-target editing effects of ABEs remain inadequately characterized. In this study, we present a biochemical method Selict-seq, designed to evaluate genome-wide off-target editing by ABEs. Selict-seq specifically captures deoxyinosine-containing single-stranded DNA and precisely identifies deoxyadenosine-to-deoxyinosine (dA-to-dI) mutation sites, elucidating the off-target effects induced by ABEs. Through investigations involving three single-guide RNAs, we identified numerous unexpected off-target edits both within and outside the protospacer regions. Notably, ABE8e(V106W) exhibited distinct off-target characteristics, including high editing rates (>10%) at previously unreported sites (e.g. RNF2 and EMX1) and out-of-protospacer mutations. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the off-target landscape associated with ABEs. In summary, our approach enables an unbiased analysis of the ABE editome and provides a widely applicable tool for specificity evaluation of various emerging genome editing technologies that produce intermediate products as deoxyinosine.">

 The presence of oncogenic driver mutations such as EGFR, ALK, or KRAS renders non-small cell lung adenocarcinomas sensitive to molecularly targeted therapies, however the inevitable emergence of acquired drug resistance remains an unsolved clinical problem. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR inhibitor that was initially developed to overcome the EGFRT790M resistance mutation, is now the standard first-line therapy. Although various mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib have been identified, the specific drivers of resistance remain unexplained in over half of patients. Recent work from our group and others has suggested that cancer-associated fibroblasts may play a role in drug resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Notably, we have observed that patient-derived cancer-associated fibroblast (PDF) cell lines established from TKI-resistant tumors display heterogeneous phenotypes with ability to rescue cancer cells from TKIs. To enable parallel discovery of both tumor cell-intrinsic and stroma-driven resistance mechanisms to osimertinib, we developed a genome-wide CRISPR sensitizer screening approach that incorporates osimertinib-resistant patient-derived EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines and conditioned media from matched immortalized PDFs. These studies aim to uncover intrinsic and extrinsic resistance pathways and nominate targets for next-generation therapies to overcome acquired resistance to osimertinib

        <tr id="A recent study published in Nature by Maya M. Arce and colleagues unveils the role of central gene circuits in governing the delicate balance between T cell rest and T cell activation. 1 This work bridges fundamental molecular biology with ﬁ ndings in preclinical models, providing insights into context-speci ﬁ c gene regulation and potential therapeutic targets for immune modulation. The immune system relies on highly specialized cells to maintain homeostasis and respond to external threats. Among these, the CD4 + T cell compartment exhibits remarkable versatility, including T cell subsets with almost antagonistic functions, and that are capable of toggling between resting (quiescent) and activated states depending on environmental cues. The IL-2 receptor alpha subunit (IL-2R α or CD25) serves as a critical marker for T cell activation, with distinct expression pro ﬁ les in regulatory T cells (Treg) and effector T cells (Teff), characterized by either its constitutive or transient upregulation upon stimulation, respectively. Despite its importance, the trans-regulatory networks orchestrating these state-speci ﬁ c responses remain incompletely understood. Therefore, screening interventions that modulate IL-2R α expression can serve as a means of identifying genes involved in T cell activation, offering valuable insights by comparing the regulatory mechanisms between Teff and Treg cells. The primary objective of this study was to identify and characterize the regulators of IL-2R α expression across different T cell states. To this end, the authors conducted a series of CRISPR screens in primary human Treg and Teff cells to uncover context-dependent regulators and explore their role in maintaining resting and activated states. Using a designed library of 6,000 sgRNAs targeting over a thousand genes coding for transcription factors and chromatin modi ﬁ ers in resting and stimulated Teff and Treg, they mapped dynamic gene circuits that">

 Background:
 Endometrial cancer (EC) illustrates diverse nucleotide substitution and chromosomal re-arrangement signatures like other cancers. Namely, four molecular types are identified, replicative polymerases, microsatellite stable, copy number high/serous-like, and microsatellite instability characterized by mutations in mismatch repair genes. With advances in molecular techniques, early prediction of disease aggressiveness can be revealed using comprehension in ECs. Although few cell proliferative genes have been documented, a complete molecular landscaping is essential for effective treatment planning and decision-making. We report, the association between clinical disease status and corresponding molecular findings to establish the role of the latter in the early prediction of disease aggression in endometrial cancer.
 Methods:
 Retrospectively, we investigated the association of genomic mutational profiles of 40 endometrial cancer patients and their clinical disease status from PET scans and HPE reports. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) test was performed using a comprehensive genomic panel (CGP) OncoIndx assay.
 Results:
 Amongst 40 patients, 65% (n = 26/40) of patients had progressive and metastatic disease from PET scans and HPE reports indicative of disease aggressiveness. Almost 80% (n = 20/26) of the aggressive disease cohort were detected to have a minimum of one genomic alteration. Their mutational profiles showed a diverse spectrum of pathway-related aberrations from cell proliferation, progression, double-strand DNA (dsDNA) repair, mismatch repair (MMR), and tumor suppression constituting a total of 83 genomic alterations detected in the whole cohort. Further, the cell proliferation and dsDNA repair pathways exhibited the highest mutational load of 57.8% (n = 48/83) and 14.5% (n = 12/83) respectively in the cohort. Likewise, tumor suppressor genes constituted the lowest frequency at 6% (n = 5/83).In addition, five patients were detected with high MSI scores and one patient with an intermediate MSI score of which two MSI-high patients were also found to harbor MMR gene mutations (MSH3:p.K383Rfs*32, p.D403H, p.E456* and p.E512*, MSH6:p.F1088Sfs*2).
 Conclusions:
 Using CGP, we observed mutational frequencies of cell proliferation and dsDNA repair pathways that act as crucial markers for disease aggression in EC. We also noted that high MSI scores were not always concordant with mutations in the classical MMR genes and vice versa. This also indicates the individual significance of estimating MSI scores in these patients for clinical decision-making. Since the identified landscape of mutations well correlated with the disease states categorized from their clinical findings, they could potentially transform into molecular attributes for early prediction of progression and metastasis aiding treatment planning and decision making.

        <tr id="The effect of ubiquitous environmental conditions on mutational mechanisms, particularly loss of heterozygosity (LOH) remains poorly understood. Environment induced LOH can rapidly alter the genome and promote disease progression. Using mutation accumulation (MA) lines, we analysed the effect of ubiquitous environmental conditions on mutational mechanisms in a diploid hybrid (S288c/YJM789) baker’s yeast strain. These included blue light, low glucose (calorie restriction), oxidative stress (H2O2), high temperature (37°C), ethanol, and salt (NaCl). The frequency of LOH increased significantly in all environments including calorie restriction relative to the control (YPD). Interestingly, the percentage of the genome covered by LOH varied significantly depending on the condition. For example, the LOH tracts seen in calorie restriction conditions were significantly shorter than those observed in blue light exposure that rapidly homozygotized the genome. We also report a unique mutational signature of blue light exposure comprising LOH, small indels, large deletions and transversion mutations (G:C > T:A; G:C > C:G), with the latter likely to result from the photooxidation of guanine bases. Our results suggest ubiquitous environmental conditions cause LOH but result in distinct mutational signatures due to the type of damage induced and the pathways used to repair them.">

 The combination of sitravatinib, nivolumab, and ipilimumab offers a novel approach to enhance immunotherapy outcomes in advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). To explore the immunomodulatory and resistance mechanisms underlying this triplet therapy, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on tumor samples collected longitudinally from 12 patients across treatment timepoints. Transcriptomic data from 70,526 cells, including 58,331 tumor microenvironment (TME) cells, revealed dynamic shifts in cellular composition and transcriptional states during therapy. Analysis of TME cells identified eight major cell types, with notable increases in T cells and reductions in myeloid and endothelial cells post-treatment. Baseline T cell abundance correlated with improved clinical response, while fibroblast enrichment predicted resistance. Tumor cells were classified into ten transcriptionally distinct clusters, including a treatment-resistant population (C8) enriched in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, and glycolysis signatures. These signatures correlated with shorter progression-free survival in the trial cohort and worse survival outcomes in an external TCGA ccRCC dataset. T cell states showed a transition from cytotoxic to exhausted phenotypes in non-responders and end-of-treatment samples, suggesting a role for T cell dysfunction in resistance. Similarly, myeloid cells exhibited a shift toward immunosuppressive phenotypes, characterized by M2-like macrophages and inhibitory signaling pathways. These findings elucidate resistance mechanisms to the triplet therapy, highlighting EMT-driven tumor cell states and immunosuppressive TME dynamics as key contributors. The identification of a tumor-specific C8 signature provides a potential biomarker for predicting poor responses and tailoring therapeutic strategies. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed to optimize patient selection and therapeutic outcomes.

 Lung cancer is the second most prevalent cancer with the highest mortality rate in the world. Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most effective clinical chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of lung cancer, but a variety of mechanisms induce its chemoresistance including alterations in microtubule-associated proteins, up-regulation of drug efflux systems. Lipid metabolism was reported to impact chemosensitivity, but the underlying mechanisms are to be clarified. Therefore, this study aims to exploring the molecular mechanisms of PTX resistance regulated by lipid metabolism, and to discover novel PTX resistant targets and therapeutic agents.



 Lipid metabolism related sgRNA library was used for CRISPR screen. PTX-resistant lung cancer cells were constructed for transcriptome sequencing. The key regulators were identified via integrating negative enriched genes in CRISPR screen and the differential ones in transcriptome sequencing. The regulation of PTX sensitivity by the key regulators was confirmed in deficient lung cancer cells. Transcriptome sequencing was applied to find downstream pathways, and immunoblotting and RT-qPCR were used to confirm the molecular mechanisms. Mouse models were used to investigate the safety and effectiveness of its inhibitors combined with PTX for lung cancer treatments in vivo.



 DGKA is highly expressed in PTX-resistant lung cancer cells, and its deficiency significantly induced PTX sensitivity in lung cancer cells. DGKA knockdown significantly inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration. In addition, DGKA depletion promoted PYX-induced cell apoptosis and G2/M-phase arrest in lung cancer cells. Transcriptomics showed that the MAPK signaling pathway was significantly enriched after DGKA knockdown, and further experiments confirmed that DGKA inhibition increased lung cancer cell sensitivity to PTX via inhibiting ERK phosphorylation. DGKA inhibitor (R59022) could induce the PTX sensitivity of lung cancer cells safely and effectively in vivo.



 DGKA promotes PTX sensitivity of lung cancer cells and alleviates PTX resistance through the MAPK pathway, providing preclinical evidence for targeting DGKA as a novel strategy for lung cancer therapy against PTX resistance.

 Background:
 Biliary tract cancers (BTC) are rare, highly aggressive malignancies with limited treatment options, leading to consistently poor outcomes. An improved understanding of BTC tumor evolution could inform enhanced screening strategies, identify useful prognostic markers, and discover novel therapeutic targets.
 Methods:
 We performed whole genome and transcriptome sequencing (WGTS) at high depth ( > 80X) on a prospective cohort of BTC tumors. After detecting mutations and mutational signatures, we developed two novel methods for driver identification and evolutionary reconstruction. First, we created new oncogene and tumor suppressor-specific models that integrate copy number profiles, structural variant breakends, and expression changes to distinguish structural drivers from neutral chromosomal rearrangements. Second, we applied population genetics techniques to fit demographic models to tumor allele frequencies across 20 paired primary and metastatic samples.
 Results:
 We analyzed 130 tumor samples from 110 patients, representing the largest BTC whole-genome cohort to date. We identified hypermutated tumors (50-150 mutations/mb) with distinct etiologies, including mismatch repair deficiency, platinum exposure, tobacco use, and aristolochic acid-related damage, the latter of which was associated with response to immunotherapy. Ourintegrated-driver approach identified an association between selection on
 RAD23A
 and an increased structural variant load, resulting in a tandem-duplicator-like mutational phenotype. This also revealed an underappreciated impact of
 SMAD4
 in BTC, which is inactivated through multiple mutation types in 12%. Notably,
 BAP1
 mutations occurred in 24% of cases, including 4% that were inactivated through deletion of the
 BAP1
 promoter that lowered transcript expression, a previously undescribed mechanism. By pairing clinical data to the genomics, we observed a co-occurrence of
 BAP1
 mutations and
 FGFR2
 fusions in small-duct, mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. These mutations were mutually exclusive with
 TP53
 mutations, which were enriched in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Finally, our novel method for subclonal population reconstruction on paired samples illuminated recent tumor evolutionary dynamics and identified an
 ARID1B
 fusion with a potential role in metastasis.
 Conclusions:
 This study uncovered novel genomic mechanisms underlying the evolutionary origins of BTC beyond those previously identified with exome and panel sequencing, highlighting the value of WGTS. These results highlight the complex genomic heterogeneity of BTC, with potential implications for precision therapy.

        <tr id="Background About 40% of relapsed or non-responder tumors exhibit therapeutic resistance in the absence of a clear genetic cause, suggesting a pivotal role of intracellular communication. A deeper understanding of signaling pathways rewiring occurring in resistant cells is crucial to propose alternative effective strategies for cancer patients. Methods To achieve this goal, we developed a novel multi-step strategy, which integrates high sensitive mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics with network-based analysis. This strategy builds context-specific networks recapitulating the signaling rewiring upon drug treatment in therapy-resistant and sensitive cells. Results We applied this strategy to elucidate the BCR::ABL1-independent mechanisms that drive relapse upon therapy discontinuation in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. We built a signaling map, detailing - from receptor to key phenotypes - the molecular mechanisms implicated in the control of proliferation, DNA damage response and inflammation of therapy-resistant cells. In-depth analysis of this map uncovered novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. Functional validation in patient-derived leukemic stem cells revealed a crucial role of acquired FLT3-dependency and its underlying molecular mechanism. Conclusions In conclusion, our study presents a novel generally applicable strategy and the reposition of FLT3, one of the most frequently mutated drivers of acute leukemia, as a potential therapeutic target for CML relapsed patients.

We captured known interactions and discovered myriad new connections that are available online. We defined the molecular mechanism of two of the strongest interactions. First, we found that WDR48 works with USP1 to restrain PCNA degradation in FEN1/LIG1-deficient cells.

        <tr id="Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) is a rare and highly aggressive cancer predisposition syndrome caused by biallelic germline mutations in mismatch repair genes. This condition is characterized by early-onset malignancies across multiple organ systems, including central nervous system tumors, hematological cancers, and gastrointestinal malignancies. CMMRD-associated tumors exhibit hypermutation and microsatellite instability, resulting in a high tumor mutation burden and rendering these malignancies responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs targeting programmed cell death protein-1 and programmed cell death ligand 1 have demonstrated remarkable efficacy, particularly in hypermutated tumors, providing durable responses and improving survival outcomes. Advances in genetic and molecular diagnostics have enhanced the ability to identify CMMRD early, allowing for the implementation of comprehensive surveillance programs and improved management strategies. A multidisciplinary and individualized approach is essential for managing CMMRD patients. This review underscores the importance of early diagnosis, surveillance, and emerging therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes and quality of life for individuals and families affected by this devastating syndrome.">

        <tr id="Endocrine therapy (ET) is typically the first-line treatment in hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2) breast cancer (BC) patients; however, almost half of the patients exhibit ET resistance after initial response. Mechanisms of ET resistance are not fully understood, and require an integrated epigenetic, transcriptomic and genetic approach. We conducted ATAC, RNA, and whole-exome sequencing on primary and metastatic BC (pBC and mBC) from 459 HR+/HER2- patients. pBC samples were derived from tumor resections of patients, which were then treated with adjuvant ET and experienced either a relapse or sustained remission over a five-year period. Samples of mBC were obtained from metastatic lesions of ET-resistant patients. We performed analysis of chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and mutational data aiming to understand relapse mechanisms in pBC and resistance mechanisms in mBC. PAM50 probability scoring of our cohort of HR+/HER2- BC revealed subgroups within pBC and mBC, which resembled PAM50 subtypes of BC. In pBC, the “Basal” and “Her2” subgroups displayed the highest percentage of relapse, compared to the “LumA” and “LumB” subgroups. TP53 alterations were enriched in “Her2” subgroups, while MAP3K1 alterations were more frequent in “LumA” subgroup. In mBC, ESR1 mutations characterized “LumB” tumors, "Her2” subgroup exhibited ERBB2 alterations, and “LumA” subgroup was enriched with FOXA1 mutations. In both pBC and mBC, the subgroups were enriched with gene sets pertaining to their associated PAM50 subtypes. “LumB” subgroup was associated with higher estrogen response. “Basal” and “Her2” subgroups showed enrichment of gene sets related to true Basal and Her2 subtypes, and transcription factor motifs of AP-1 and TFAP2. “Basal” and “Her2” subgroups was characterized by poor survival. PAM50 probability scoring was useful to dissect heterogeneity and to unveil insights into molecular mechanisms associated with the risk of relapse and ET resistance within HR+/HER2- BC. These findings may improve prognostic accuracy and patient stratification in HR+/HER2- BC cohorts.

 The rapid emergence of resistance to targeted therapies poses a substantial challenge in managing various advanced cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). The extent to which PCa cells can autonomously manipulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) and swiftly adapt to therapeutic challenges remains inadequately understood. We have elucidated that PCa cells can exploit neurolysin, a crucial regulator of neuronal signaling, to counter therapeutic interventions. The frequent absence of neurolysin results in increased WNT3A secretion into the TME and activates aberrant WNT signaling in adjacent cancer cells, thereby conferring AR targeted therapy resistance. This escalated WNT secretion and subsequent resistance are dependent on dysregulated cellular trafficking governed by the motor protein KIF11, which can be abolished by targeting either WNT3A or KIF11. These findings reveal an uncharted mechanism where cancer cells divert neuronal signaling molecules to redirect cellular trafficking machinery, thereby autonomously altering the TME and promoting resistance.


 Our study reveals an as-yet-undescribed molecular mechanism by which cancer cells can divert key neuronal molecules to regulate cellular trafficking and thereby autonomously modify the TME and promote resistance. It not only filled a crucial knowledge gap by elucidating how cancer cells autonomously modify cellular trafficking and the TME to resist therapy, but also suggest a novel therapeutic approach to address this challenge in contemporary targeted therapies.

 Despite recent advances in gastric cancer therapy, chemotherapy resistance and lack of methods for selecting combination regimens remain major problems. Organoids, which recapitulate the in vivo micro-environment, can be established from surgical specimens with a high success rate, and are widely used for drug sensitivity assays. Cancer organoids are also known to contain abundant amounts of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subpopulation of tumor cells with self-renewal and differentiation capabilities. CSCs are thought to contribute to tumor initiation, metastasis, and acquiring resistance to chemotherapy by altering their phenotype during the treatment.In this study, we aimed to discover a novel biomarker for predicting multidrug resistance using gastric cancer organoids (GCOs), which provide in vivo-like culture system that more closely resembles tumor cell organization than traditional cell lines, to understand the mechanism of multidrug resistance in cells, including CSCs, under in vivo conditions and to identify novel biomarkers to predict chemoresistance.We evaluated 5-fluorouracil or oxaliplatin-resistant GCOs to find novel biomarkers that reflect multidrug resistance in gastric cancer. To examine the resistance mechanisms, RNA-seq analysis and ex vivo drug sensitivity testing were performed. The association of biomarkers with patient prognosis and chemotherapy efficacy was evaluated using three original cohorts with a total of 230 cases. The results were also validated with two independent public cohorts and a single-cell RNA sequence data. Increased expression of PI3/Elafin was detected in all 5-fluorouracil or oxaliplatin-resistant GCOs. Our findings suggest a potential association of PI3/Elafin expression with ribosome biosynthesis and RNA metabolism under organoid conditions. We also found that PI3/Elafin overexpression promotes 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin/cisplatin resistance but not paclitaxel resistance. Immunohistochemical evaluation of Elafin expression revealed that the Elafin-positive gastric cancer group had a poorer outcome, especially in terms of time-to-recurrence. Elafin positivity was also an independent predictor of relapse after chemotherapy with DNA-damaging agents. PI3/Elafin promotes DNA-damaging drug resistance through multiple downstream regulations related to RNA and ribosomal metabolism. We demonstrated that PI3/Elafin contributes to the acquisition of resistance to 5-fluorouracil and platinum drugs in in vivo-like environments and identified GOs related to ribosome and RNA metabolism as novel PI3/Elafin downstream targets. Our results provide new insights into multidrug resistance mechanisms and highlight PI3/Elafin as a novel tool for precise stratification of patients with gastric cancer.

 Intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) refers to the presence of diverse cell populations within a single tumor, each with distinct genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic characteristics. This complexity presents significant challenges in treatment, as different subpopulations may respond variably to therapies, yet the non-genetic component of ITH and its contribution to treatment response remains poorly understood. We mapped transcriptomic and epigenomic ITH to explore evolution of non-genetic ITH in response to therapy in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).



 The SCANDARE study (NCT03017573) included patients with HGSOC that are treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Biopsies were performed at baseline, after NAC surgery and at recurrence for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq, n=17 samples, 111,946 with 1,773 median gene coverage), single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq, n=35 samples, 151,719 nuclei with 2,843 median gene coverage), and single-cell epigenomics (snCUT&Tag, n=24 samples, 58,892 nuclei with 1,409 unique fragments median coverage). Our snCUT&Tag dataset is one of the first single-cell epigenomic map of cancer patients under treatment, focusing on the histone modification H3K4me1, which accumulates at primed and active enhancers and promoters. We integrated these clinically annotated single-cell/nuclei datasets with publicly available scRNA-seq data of HGSOC.



 We constructed a consensus map of functional tumor states in HGSOC, based on scRNA-seq analysis of over 200,000 tumor cells. This analysis revealed 15 recurrent tumor cell phenotypes, ranging from stressed to cycling or inflammatory states. We identified the transcription factors and cell-cell communications specific to each tumor cell state. These tumor states are encoded at the epigenomic level, we could identify in each tumor epigenetic clones - clusters of cells with the same epigenome - each displaying a H3K4me1 landscape characteristic of one tumor state. These results show that tumor states correspond to tumor populations with distinct non-genetic features. Longitudinal sampling by snRNA-seq further showed that tumor state composition consistently evolves upon chemotherapy exposure in patients: tumors lose their cycling, hypoxic and interferon cells while gaining cells with partial mesenchymal and inflammatory characteristics.



 We propose a consensus map of transcriptomic and epigenomic tumor states in HGSOC. Our work is a proof of concept that we can monitor functional ITH with high resolution snRNA-seq from frozen biopsies of the standard of care. We show that these consensus tumor states consistently evolve upon treatment in all patients, pinpointing tumor cell states that are not successfully targeted by NAC, that would need to be targeted by adjuvant therapies.

        <tr id="Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is a key biomarker associated with increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. Accurate identification of HRD status is essential for selecting patients most likely to benefit from these therapies. Current diagnostic approaches combine sequencing to detect mutations in homologous recombination repair genes—particularly BRCA1 and BRCA2—with genome-wide analysis of structural genomic alterations indicative of HRD. This review briefly outlines the biological basis of HRD and its clinical significance and then focuses on currently available assays for HRD assessment. We compare their molecular strategies, including the use of targeted gene panels and genomic instability metrics such as loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance, and large-scale state transitions. The review also highlights the strengths and limitations of each platform and discusses their role in guiding clinical decision-making. Challenges related to dynamic tumor evolution and the interpretation of HRD status in recurrent disease settings are also addressed.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and highly lethal type of primary brain tumor in adults. Therapeutic failure is partly attributed to a fraction of Glioblastoma Stem Cells (GSCs) that show high levels of heterogeneity and plasticity. GSCs exist in a transcriptional gradient between two states: Developmental (Dev) and Injury Response (IR) in which IR-GSCs exhibit more invasive behaviors. While previous studies have identified fitness genes in GSCs, the genes required to establish and maintain the Dev and IR states remain poorly defined. To identify the regulators of the IR GSC state, we performed a phenotypic genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) screen in patient-derived GSCs based on cell surface expression of the IR marker CD44. Notably, we found that perturbations of the histone acetyltransferase EP300 in IR GSCs led to decreased CD44 cell surface expression, significant downregulation of gene expression signatures associated with the IR state, and to decreased self-renewal and invasion. Furthermore, genetic targeting of Ep300 in a mouse GBM model delayed tumor initiation and/or progression. Collectively, our results establish EP300 as a regulator of the IR state in GSCs and provide a mechanistic basis for its therapeutic targeting in GBM. Significance A genome-wide phenotypic CRISPR-Cas9 screen in a patient-derived Glioblastoma Stem Cell line identified the genes required to maintain the Injury-Response cellular state, with a focus on the histone acetyl transferase gene EP300. This study suggests how therapeutic targeting of cellular state could reduce the aggressiveness of GBM tumors.">

 The combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) with endocrine therapy prolongs survival of patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Nearly all patients with advanced disease treated with this combination eventually progress, highlighting a need for therapeutic interventions that prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Drug tolerant persister (DTP) cells represent a reservoir of surviving cells from which drug-resistant clones eventually emerge. We hypothesized that targeting breast cancer cells in a DTP state that emerge under selective pressure from CDK4/6i would prevent the emergence of drug resistance. First, we aimed to delineate genomic and epigenomic features of DTPs under continuous CDK4/6i + antiestrogen therapy. We treated MCF7 and T47D ER+ breast cancer cells with palbociclib + estrogen deprivation long-term (4 weeks). Cells that survived long-term treatment exhibited characteristics of DTPs, such as reversible sensitivity to CDK4/6i + estrogen deprivation, reversible cell cycle arrest, and reversible transcriptional programs associated with the DTP state. To translate these findings to patients, we examined gene expression data from residual tumors after neoadjuvant treatment with palbociclib and the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole in the NeoPalAna trial and found that these tumors showed a similar enrichment of gene signatures associated with DTPs compared to tumors before treatment. To elucidate with DTPs give rise to drug resistant clones, we barcoded MCF7 and T47D cells with a lineage and RNA recovery (LARRY) barcode library with ∼315, 000 diverse barcodes, such that we can track them during long-term treatment. Barcoded cells were treated with palbociclib plus estrogen deprivation for 0 h, 72 h, and 4 weeks and then subjected to single-cell RNA-seq; 101 and 15 clones that were initially arrested in G0/G1 eventually expanded at 4 weeks, while 376 and 27 clones were eliminated during treatment of MCF7 and T47D cells, respectively. Comparing the expanding clones with the exhausted clones, we identified 50 marker genes for DTP cells in each cell line. We are currently using a CRISPR-Cas9 targeted knockout screen to identify which of these genes are causal to DTP survival. We will then compare results from these single cell approaches with RNA microarray analysis from residual tumors after neoadjuvant treatment in the NeoPalAna trial. In summary, a small subset of ER+ breast cancer cells survive long-term treatment with CDK4/6i plus estrogen deprivation and exhibit reversible transcriptomic features of DTPs. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis in barcoded breast cancer cells revealed genes significantly upregulated in expanding clones that show features of the DTP state. We proposed therapeutic targeting of these genes may reduce survival of drug-tolerant cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance.

 Microsatellite Instability (MSI) is a condition characterized by the presence of mutations in microsatellite regions of DNA. This can lead to the accumulation of mutations in microsatellite regions, resulting in genomic instability and happened in various cancer types. Werner helicase (WRN) plays an important role in highly MSI (MSI-H) cancer cells and cause synthetic lethality when WRN was inhibited or knockout. Few WRN inhibitor like HRO761 and VVD-214 were revealed effectively killing the MSI-H cancer cells such as human colorectal cell lines HCT116 and SW48. In this study, to face the new unmet need that WRN inhibitors anti-cancer drugs may occurred, a WRN inhibitor resistant cell line against HRO761 and VVD-214 were established through the combination drug tolerance in vivo and in vitro was established. The drug resistant tumor tissues were collected after the in vivo drug resistance appeared as regrowth of tumors under 20 mg/kg HRO761 and 5 mg/kg VVD-214 treatment and dissected for primary cell culture to get the drug resistant cell line by escalating drug concentrations in vitro. The WRN inhibitors resistant cell lines were genotype and phenotype checked by STR and IC50 of cell growth when reached the drug resistant index more than 5 times of that of parental cells and indicated that different WRN inhibitors resistant HCT116 cell lines were successfully established and helpful for the discovery of anti-cancer drugs targeted on resistant to WRN inhibitors.

        <tr id="Lung cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer type worldwide and is characterised by its high metastatic potential. Standard therapy for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases includes chemotherapy with the platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Although lung cancer cases respond well to cisplatin at the beginning of treatment, ~ 60% develop chemotherapy resistance during this process. In this study, a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screening approach was employed to identify genes that cisplatin-resistant NSCLC Calu1 cells are more addicted to than sensitive cells. Cisplatin-resistant Calu1 cells were generated by the dose escalation method, and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screening was performed with the Brunello CRISPR knockout library. Bioinformatics analyses of the obtained next-generation sequencing data revealed 63 potential candidate genes responsible for cisplatin resistance, including G protein-coupled receptor 89A (GPR89A), Poly(U) binding splicing factor 60 (PUF60), NBAS subunit of NRZ tethering complex (NBAS) and GrpE like 1, mitochondrial (GRPEL1). The GPR89A protein is located in the Golgi cisterna and Golgi-associated vesicle membrane, enables voltage-gated anion channel activity, and is involved in intracellular pH reduction. Functional studies carried out with GPR89A-knockout cisplatin-resistant Calu1 cells resulted in cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and increased polyploidy, and also prevented colony formation and cell migration. Cisplatin treatment, on the other hand, resulted in increased cell death by apoptosis upon cell cycle arrest in the S phase. In conclusion, this is the first study that identified GPR89A as a potential therapeutic target to overcome cisplatin resistance in NSCLC Calu1 cells.">

        <tr id="Recent advances of cancer immunotherapy have identified neoantigens as essential targets for personalized treatments. However, since neoantigens are generally unique in individual cancers, neoantigen therapies that are more broadly applicable are eagerly awaited. Shared neoantigens, derived from recurrent mutations found across multiple patients, are considered to be a challenging, but promising approach. Here we analyzed shared frameshift neoantigens derived from frameshift indels in TCGA exome sequencing data and identified 760 possible recurrent frameshift mutation clusters (FSCs) that share frameshifted open reding frames and premature stop codons. Among them, we investigated FSCs in the APC gene (APC-F2-1472* and APC-F3-1512*) and identified HLA-A*24:02-restricted frameshift neoantigen peptides that elicited specific CD8+ T cell responses. Subsequently we identified their corresponding T cell receptor (TCR) sequences and generated genetically-engineered T cells expressing these APC frameshift neoantigen-specific TCRs. These engineered T cells specifically recognized target cells presenting these neoantigens and cytotoxic activity against them, supporting the therapeutic potential of targeting APC frameshift neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy. This study provides compelling evidence for the development of neoantigen-based therapies targeting common frameshift peptides, offering a promising approach for more effective, relatively broadly applicable immunotherapeutic strategies that could benefit a subset population of cancer patients.">

However, drug development targeting specific molecular and cellular abnormalities in NPC has slowed. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and bioinformatics, particularly those integrating multi-omics data, offer a more effective alternative to traditional in vitro screening methods for identifying clinically actionable targets in NPC. Through a combination of multi-omics analyses and AI-driven screening, we identified CACNA2D1 as a novel cancer-cell-specific therapeutic target in NPC. Our research indicates that exploiting Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) tethering increases H3K27 acetylation near the CACNA2D1 promoter. Analysis of clinical specimens revealed significant upregulation of CACNA2D1 at both the transcriptional and translational levels (p-value < 0.01). Functional studies demonstrated that the mouse tumour size shrank by one-third upon the depletion of CACNA2D1, and there was an 85% reduction in cancer cell growth through the blockage of enhancers, while the presence of CACNA2D1 conferred a survival advantage during NPC tumour development. These findings highlight the potential of CACNA2D1 as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in NPC.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite therapeutic advances, there is a critical need to identify novel, effective, and safe drug targets to improve precision treatment strategies.We developed a multi-layered framework integrating Mendelian randomization (MR), colocalization analysis, genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to prioritize causal and druggable genes in CRC. Single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing were used to characterize gene expression within the tumor microenvironment. Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) assessed off-target effects, and drug repurposing potential was evaluated using OpenTargets, DrugBank, and DGIdb. Validation of key targets was performed through RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in CRC patient samples.Out of 4,479 druggable genes, MR analysis identified 47 candidates significantly associated with CRC risk. Six genes (TFRC, TNFSF14, LAMC1, PLK1, TYMS, and TSSK6) demonstrated strong colocalization signals and were further validated across replication datasets and subtype-stratified analyses. PheWAS analysis revealed minimal off-target effects for these genes. Notably, several of these genes have already been targeted by existing or investigational drugs, suggesting potential for repurposing. These genes exhibited distinct expression patterns in tumor and stromal cell types and were differentially expressed in CRC versus normal tissues. Among them, TNFSF14, an immune modulator, is particularly involved in regulating T cell activation within the tumor microenvironment.This study identifies and validates six promising druggable targets for CRC, providing a strong foundation for future preclinical studies. These findings open avenues for advancing precision oncology and drug repurposing strategies in CRC treatment, contributing to the development of more effective and personalized therapeutic approaches.">

Identifying key oncogenic hubs of human cancers may lay the groundwork for developing breakthrough therapeutic strategies. Actin-like 6A (ACTL6A; BAF53A) was originally identified as a chromatin remodeling factor involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes, especially in stem and progenitor cells. The preponderance of evidence revealed the overexpression of ACTL6A in most cancers and its crucial role in various malignant phenotypes, including cell cycle progression, cancer stemness, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, redox and glucose metabolism, and DNA replication and repair. Interestingly, emerging data suggest that the oncogenic function of ACTL6A is mediated through diverse mechanisms beyond its canonical function in transcriptional regulation, including notably the stabilization of oncoproteins and stemness factors, such as YAP, VPS72, and MYC. Here, we describe the isoforms and the putative functional domains of ACTL6A. We summarize the expression pattern and prognostic significance of ACTL6A in human cancers and the upstream regulatory mechanisms of its expression. We summarize recent progress in understanding the diverse pro-oncogenic functions of ACTL6A and emphasize its pleiotropic mechanisms of action as a regulatory hub of cancer stemness and progression. The review highlights the importance and the potential utilities of characterizing ACTL6A, which may imply molecularly informed diagnostics and therapeutics to improve the outcome of cancer patients.">

 Chromosomal instability (CIN) is the predominant form of genomic instability in cancers, characterized by both numerical and structural alterations of chromosomes. CIN is crucial for the most threatening aspect of cancers: their ability to evolve, allowing them to circumvent immune detection, metastasize, develop resistance to therapies, and lead to treatment failure. At the same time, the CIN phenotype could provide valuable targets for cancer therapy. We developed a multiplex FISH (miFISH) method to study heterogeneity and ongoing CIN in cancer cells. The objective of our research was to determine whether high-grade aneuploidy develops through sequential or abrupt changes in chromosomal content, a question previously unexplored due to the absence of comprehensive methods for simultaneously detecting different forms of ongoing CIN on a single-cell level.



 Sequential hybridizations of miFISH panels allow the assessment of up to 35 probes per single cell. Each panel was designed to include the centromeric probe and gene-specific probes on the p- and q-arm for a given chromosome. This approach was applied to colorectal cancer cell lines (with and without microsatellite instability) and colorectal cancer samples. A total of 10000-25000 targets were collected from each slide. Analysis was done by counting of signals in mononucleated cells, binucleated/dividing cells and metaphase spreads.



 The simultaneous evaluation of centromeric and gene-specific sets of miFISH probes led to unprecedented insights into the patterns of distribution of chromosomal content among individual cells, and, especially, in dividing cells. We compared different forms of ongoing CIN: structural rearrangements, formation of micronuclei with whole chromosomes or chromosomal fragments, non-disjunctions of chromosomes, grossly asymmetrical cell divisions, including divisions with ploidy changes and multipolar mitoses. We observed that gradual changes in chromosomal/genomic content occur primarily due to frequent structural rearrangements, less frequent chromosome or fragment losses in micronuclei, and very rare single chromosome non-disjunctions. Of note, grossly abnormal cell divisions, characterized by massive non-disjunctions and structural rearrangements, occur with relatively high frequency. The same patterns of chromosomal heterogeneity and instability have been observed in cancer cell lines and in tumor samples.



 The novel miFISH approach applied to studies of chromosomal instability in colorectal cancers and cell lines revealed multiple paths leading to chromosomal diversification of cancer cell populations. Grossly abnormal cell divisions are likely to contribute to high-level aneuploidies and ploidy changes, and could underlie the rapid evolution of cancer under selective pressure.

        <tr id="Radiotherapy is a cornerstone of colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment; however, its therapeutic efficacy is often compromised by both intrinsic and acquired resistance in CRC cells. This study employed small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology to elucidate the functional roles of BAMBI, GADD34, NFKBIA, and NFKBID in CRC cell lines SW480 and HCT116. We assessed their impact on key cellular processes and radiation sensitivity. Gene silencing of all four target genes significantly suppressed CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown enhanced radiation sensitivity, as evidenced by a substantial increase in apoptosis and a marked reduction in cell viability compared with controls. These findings suggest that BAMBI, GADD34, NFKBIA, and NFKBID serve as critical regulators of CRC progression and radiation resistance. Overall, this study provides a mechanistic foundation for further exploration into the pathways underlying radiation resistance and underscores the potential for developing personalized radiotherapy strategies guided by molecular profiling.">

        <tr id="Background Transposons are DNA sequences able to move or copy themselves to other genomic locations leading to insertional mutagenesis. Although transposon-derived sequences account for half of the human genome, most elements are no longer transposition competent. Moreover, transposons are normally repressed through epigenetic silencing in healthy adult tissues but become derepressed in several human cancers, with high activity detected in colorectal cancer. Their impact on non-malignant and malignant tissue as well as the differences between somatic and germline retrotransposition remain poorly understood. With new sequencing technologies, including long read sequencing, we can access intricacies of retrotransposition, such as insertion sequence details and nested repeats, that have been previously challenging to characterize. Results In this study, we investigate somatic and germline retrotransposition by analyzing long read sequencing from 56 colorectal cancers and 112 uterine leiomyomas. We identified 1495 somatic insertions in colorectal samples, while striking lack of insertions was detected in uterine leiomyomas. Our findings highlight differences between somatic and germline events, such as transposon type distribution, insertion length, and target site preference. Leveraging long-read sequencing, we provide an in-depth analysis of the twin-priming phenomenon, detecting it across transposable element types that remain active in humans, including Alus. Additionally, we detect an abundance of germline transposons in repetitive DNA, along with a relationship between replication timing and insertion target site. Conclusions Our study reveals a stark contrast in somatic transposon activity between colorectal cancers and uterine leiomyomas, and highlights differences between somatic and germline transposition. This suggests potentially different conditions in malignant and non-malignant tissues, as well as in germline and somatic tissues, which could be involved in the transposition process. Long-read sequencing provided important insights into transposon behavior, allowing detailed examination of structural features such as twin priming and nested elements.

        <tr id="Genomic instability has been increasingly recognized over the past decade as a fundamental driver of cancer initiation and progression, largely owing to its association with specific genes and cellular mechanisms that offer therapeutic potential. However, a comprehensive molecular framework that captures the interconnected processes underlying this phenomenon remains elusive. In this study, we focused on polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a key cell cycle regulator frequently overexpressed in diverse human tumors, to reconstruct a regulatory network that consolidates pre-existing biological knowledge exclusively related to pathways involved in genome stability maintenance and cancer. The resulting model integrates nine biological processes, 1030 reactions, and 716 molecular species to form a literature-supported network in which PLK1 serves as a central regulatory node. However, rather than depicting an isolated PLK1-centric system, this network reflects a broader and more complex architecture of interrelated genomic instability mechanisms. As expected, the simulations reproduced known behaviors associated with PLK1 dysregulation, reinforcing the well-established role of the kinase in genome destabilization. Importantly, this model also enables the exploration of additional, less-characterized dynamics, including the potential involvement of genes such as kif2c, incenp, and other regulators of chromosomal segregation and DNA repair, which appear to contribute to instability events downstream of PLK1. While these findings are grounded in mechanistic simulations and require further experimental validation, gene expression and survival analyses across tumor types support their clinical relevance by linking them to poor prognosis in specific cancers. Overall, the model provides a systemic and adaptable foundation for studying PLK1-related genomic instability, enabling both the reinforcement of known mechanisms and discovery of candidate genes and circuits that may drive tumorigenesis through compromised genome integrity across distinct cancer contexts.">

 In the present study we illustrate how, using the concept of synthetic lethality (SL), we developed cellular assays suitable for the screening of new drugs targeting cancer-specific weaknesses. SL is a promising strategy in cancer therapy that exploits the genetic vulnerabilities of cancer cells. This approach targets pairs of genes where the mutation or changes of one gene does not affect cell viability, but the simultaneous occurrence of these events in both leads to cell death. This concept is particularly valuable in cancer treatment, as it allows for the selective targeting of cancer cells while sparing normal cells. In this study we coupled powerful molecular approaches such as CRISPR/Cas9 or RNA interference (siRNA and shRNA) with cell viability tests (CellTiter-Glo®), to generate cellular assays suitable for assessing SL of two different genes of interest (GOIs) in proof-of-concept studies and perform drug screening to identify novel inhibitors able to mimic loss or mutations of the GOIs, inducing specific cell death of tumor cells. First, we induced SL by silencing VPS4A in cells already exhibiting loss or reduced function of VPS4B, ultimately triggering selective tumor cell death while sparing normal cells. Indeed, the homozygous loss of VPS4B is seen in up to 4% of colorectal, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. The SL was then assessed by using siRNA to silence VPS4A and VPS4B in various cancer cell lines expressing different levels of the 2 GOIs and evaluating cell viability. Conversely, to generate stable cellular assays, CRISPR/Cas9 technology was applied to develop both VPS4B knockout (KO) and heterozygous (HET) cell lines, validated through Sanger sequencing and protein expression analysis. These genetically modified lines were critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms driving SL, as they were further engineered to obtain an inducible VPS4A silencing (shRNA technology), allowing for controlled VPS4A depletion. These experiments demonstrated that VPS4A silencing in VPS4B KO cells significantly reduced cell viability, confirming the synthetic lethal relationship between the two GOIs. In conclusion, our survival assay approach could be applied to validate the SL between 2 GOIs, identify a suitable genetic context for applying customized therapeutic options, and new drugs to treat cancer. Proof of principle studies could be conducted in transient using siRNA to silence GOIs in various cancer cell lines expressing different levels of GOIs; while stable modulation of the expression of GOI might be obtained using ad hoc engineered cell lines, thus allowing long-term studies and screening campaigns. Cellular assays able to elucidate SL mechanisms may have a significant impact on the cancer drug discovery identifying therapies that specifically target cancer cells with known genetic alterations, while minimizing the impact on normal cells and therefore reducing potential side effects.

        <tr id="Background Resistance to radiation therapy is a common challenge in the field of oncology. Cancer cells with an increased ability to effectively repair DNA or cells with higher levels of antioxidants are more resistant to radiation. As cancer cells rely on these traits for survival, they may offer vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Methods In the current study, rectal cancer organoids that showed different responses to radiation treatment were identified. RNA sequencing was used to compare radioresistant and radiosensitive organoids. In vitro combination drug screens were performed. The selection of drugs was guided by the RNA sequencing results. Results Radioresistant organoids exhibited superior transcriptional adaptability and activated more DNA repair pathways when irradiated. Additionally, radioresistant organoids displayed enhanced antioxidant metabolism, including pathways related to the detoxification of reactive oxygen species and the synthesis of glutathione. Combinatorial drug screens identified the combination of RRx-001 (an inducer of oxidative stress) with GCLC inhibitor BSO as a highly effective and synergistic drug combination in killing radioresistant organoids. CRISPR-CAS-mediated knockout of GCLC sensitised organoids to RRx-001. Conclusion Combining RRx-001 with the inhibition of GCLC may be a promising alternative treatment strategy in radioresistant rectal cancer.">

 Glioblastoma (GBM) is notoriously resistant to treatment, largely due to its inherent enhancement of DNA repair mechanisms. Standard therapies, which include ionizing radiation and alkylating agents, primarily exert their effects by damaging DNA. Therefore, targeting the DNA damage response (DDR) has emerged as a promising strategy to sensitize tumor cells to these treatments. The RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 (MSI1) is known to contribute to the aggressive nature of GBM, yet its specific role in DNA damage-mediated therapy resistance remains largely unexplored. This study employed three GBM cell lines, an orthotopic GBM model in immunodeficient mice, and tissue samples from 35 GBM patients. We developed a specialized antibody to detect phosphorylation at the MSI1-S347 site in both cells and tissues. Site-directed mutagenesis and transcriptome sequencing were used to investigate the effects of MSI1 phosphorylation on GBM. The comet and colony formation assays were conducted to assess therapy resistance in GBM cells following treatment with carmustine (BCNU) or X-ray irradiation. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were utilized to identify cancer stem cell markers in GBM. A luminescence reporter system was created to pinpoint the binding site of non-phosphorylated MSI1 and to establish a visual drug screening platform targeting MSI1-S347. We identified a new phosphorylation site at serine-347 (S347) on the C-terminal of MSI1, which transcriptome analysis linked to the processing of DNA double-strand breaks in GBM. Patient tissue samples showed significantly higher levels of phosphorylated MSI1-S347 compared to normal brain tissues, regardless of tumor location or GBM subtype. Phosphorylation at MSI1-S347 enhanced BCNU resistance by promoting DNA repair mechanisms, and it also increased resistance to X-ray irradiation by preserving colony-forming ability. Additionally, higher levels of S347 phosphorylation were associated with reduced survival rates in GBM animal models. Mechanistically, we observed a positive correlation between phosphorylated S347 and the cancer stem cell marker CD133 expression. Further analysis revealed changes in binding interactions between MSI1 and p21 mRNA depending on the S347 phosphorylation state. To address this, we developed a luminescence reporter system to visually screen drugs that can modulate MSI1-S347 phosphorylation. This platform measures S347 phosphorylation levels in vivo and serves as a drug screening tool targeting GBM therapy resistance. This study uncovers a novel mechanism by which MSI1 enhances DNA damage repair, contributing to therapy resistance in GBM. Understanding the DNA damage response can guide clinical strategies to inhibit the MSI1 binding switch and enhance treatment efficacy. Targeting the MSI1 binding switch could offer a more effective approach to overcoming GBM therapy resistance.

 Radiotherapy (RT) is an integral modality for the treatment of cancer, with >70% patients requiring RT. However, tumor responses to RT are heterogeneous and influenced by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Clonal dynamics have identified that in some cancers, radioresistance is dominated by a process of clonal selection and adaptation, thereby suggesting that tumor cells harbor an adaptive pro-survival mechanism to RT. To understand the mechanisms underpinning this process, we generated four radioresistant (RR) cancer models - prostate (22Rv1, DU145) and head and neck (FaDu, HK1) cancer cell lines by exposing them to 90 Gy over 45 fractions delivered over 12 weeks, which mimicked the fractionated radiotherapy schema employed in the clinic. First, WES revealed an enrichment of mismatch repair mutational signatures (SBS6, 14, 15, 20) across our RR models and identified several non-synonymous single nucleotide variants in RAD51AP1, SMC1A, and APC2 genes that are associated with pro-survival pathways. At the transcriptome level, we observed several up- and down-regulated genes across the 4 models, but were able to identify five common overexpressed genes - ATP8A1, BAHD1, CTSD, JAK1, and MYLIP. Over-representation pathway analyses highlighted the association of the BAHD1 gene with an activated heterochromatin formation pathway (rich factor=0.01, adjusted P-value=0.02). This corroborated WB and IF analyses showing an increased expression of heterochromatin markers (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) in the RR cells post-irradiation, but not in their respective wild-type (WT) parentals. Knockdown of BAHD1 by siBAHD1 treatment consequently reduced the expression of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 and reversed the RR phenotypes (Clonogeic SF2Gy siBAHD1:control=1.72 [FaDu-RR], SF4Gy siBAHD1:control=1.63 [22Rv1-RR]). Collectively, these findings point to the model that BAHD1-dependent heterochromatin formation is an acquired phenomenon integral to radioresistance in our models. Simultaneously, parallel high-throughput drug screening of our RR and WT cancer cells identified susceptibility to Panobinostat (Pano) - a pan-HDAC inhibitor in vitro and validated in vivo. Combinatorial Pano and AZD7762 - a Chk1 inhibitor exhibited stronger anti-tumor activity against the RR than WT cells (IC50: 0.45 nm [RR] vs 0.60 nm [WT]). Downstream analyses of Pano-treated RR compared with WT tumors further indicated higher apoptosis and reduced proliferation in the former. Finally, knockdown of class I and II HDACs pointed to reversal of HDAC6 expression as the primary target of Pano. Herein, our systems approach of investigations of our RR cancer models uncovered the importance of the heterochromatin in acquired cancer radioresistance, and presented a potential new molecular vulnerability of RR cancer cells to targeting by epigenetic drugs.

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common cancer worldwide, is one of the deadliest cancers. CRC is known as a cold tumor, characterized by a low immune response that makes it difficult for immune cells to infiltrate and exhibits strong resistance to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition. This restricted response is largely attributed to signature gene mutations including mismatch repair (MMR) genes, KRAS, BRAF, APC, and TP53, which are also the main oncogenes in CRC. Mutated signature genes continuously upregulate abnormal signaling pathways, leading to excessive proliferation, cancer progression, and metastasis. Furthermore, it reorganizes the tumor microenvironment (TME) by recruiting immunosuppressive cells. However, the mutation can produce neoantigens that can provoke an immune response, making it a potential target for immunotherapy. In particular, cancer vaccines that leverage the strong neoantigenic properties of these mutations are considered promising for overcoming immune resistance and eliciting anti-tumor responses. In this review, we will describe signature gene mutations in CRC and focus on cancer vaccines targeting these mutations as potential therapies for CRC.">

 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a blood cancer that affects ∼20, 000 people annually, with an overall 5-year survival rate of ∼30%. Leukemia cells originate in the bone marrow where normal cell differentiation goes awry, leading to the expansion of immature myeloid cells that retain partial differentiation, or cell state (monocytic, granulocytic, primitive, etc. [Van Galen et al, Cell 2019]). However, the mechanism by which cell state shifts cooperate with protein signaling changes to bring about secondary mutations is still unknown. In this work we generated AML cell lines resistant to venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor), decitabine (hypomethylating agent) and gilteritinib (FLT3 inhibitor) as single agents and in combination and found changes in cell state, protein signaling, and mutational burden. To interrogate the mechanisms behind these changes, we treated four primary AML cells with these drugs (alone and in combination) and captured transcriptomic and proteomic measurements of persistent AML patient cells after 1 month of treatment to compare drug-induced shifts in cell state.
 We collected single-cell transcriptomic and global proteomic measurements across two models of venetoclax, gilteritinib, and decitabine resistance: (1) MOLM14 cells treated for up to 6 months with each drug/drug combination, and (2) 4 ex vivo patient primary AML cells treated with monotherapy and drug combination for 1 month. In each model system, we measured shifts in cell populations using single cell-derived signatures of cell state based on the transcriptomic data, then calculated differential expression and pathway enrichment statistics of drug resistance models compared to their untreated control using the proteomic data.
 In our model of short-term drug resistance, transcriptomic data indicated that leukemia cells acquired a more granulocytic phenotype upon treatment with gilteritinib, became more monocytic with venetoclax treatment, and remained unchanged with decitabine treatment. These shifts occurred with little change in protein abundance (<40 proteins differentially expressed) according to our proteomics measurements of the same samples. Venetoclax combined with decitabine also caused cells to become more monocytic, while combining venetoclax with gilteritinib caused a decrease in monocytic cells as well a noticeable shift (100-500 proteins) in protein expression. Long term drug exposure caused further changes in MOLM14 cells, with many drug-resistant cells becoming more monocytic and exhibiting dramatic changes to protein signaling with up to ∼2000 proteins differentially expressed. We are now using these omics measurements to identify putative drug targets that prevent the development of drug resistance. In conclusion, we found that drug-induced protein changes can alter leukemia cell phenotypes that influence mutations and resistance in AML.

        <tr id="Chromosomal instability (CIN), a characteristic feature of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), drives tumor aggressiveness and therapy resistance, presenting an intractable problem in cancer treatment. CIN leads to constitutive stimulation of the innate immune cGAS–STING pathway, which has been typically linked to anti-tumor immunity. However, despite the high CIN burden in EAC, the cGAS– STING pathway remains largely intact. To address this paradox, we developed novel esophageal cancer models, including a CIN-isogenic model, discovering myeloid-attracting chemokines – with the chemokine CXCL8 (IL-8) as a prominent hit – as conserved CIN-driven targets in EAC. Using high-resolution multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy, we quantified the extent of ongoing cGAS-activating CIN in human EAC tumors by measuring cGAS-positive micronuclei in tumor cells, validated by orthogonal whole-genome sequencing-based CIN metrics. By coupling in situ CIN assessment with single-nucleus RNA sequencing and multiplex immunophenotypic profiling, we found tumor cell-intrinsic innate immune activation and intratumoral myeloid cell inflammation as phenotypic consequences of CIN in EAC. Additionally, we identified increased tumor cell-intrinsic CXCL8 expression in CINhigh EAC, accounting for the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Using a novel signature of CIN, termed CINMN, which captures ongoing CIN-associated gene expression, we confirm poor patient outcomes in CINhigh tumors with signs of aberrantly rewired cGAS–STING pathway signaling. Together, our findings help explain the counterintuitive maintenance and expression of cGAS–STING pathway components in aggressive, CINhigh tumors and emphasize the need to understand the contribution of CIN to the shaping of a pro-tumor immune landscape. Therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting the cGAS-driven inflammation axis may be instrumental in improving patient outcomes in this aggressive cancer.">

 Therapy resistance is one of the most common underlying causes of poor prognosis in cancer patients, ultimately driving fatal outcome. We have previously demonstrated that following chemotherapeutic stress, a subset of cancer cells undergo a mitotic skip and enter an endocycle, causing whole-genome duplication without division. This endocycling cell state is resistant to cytotoxic therapies and thus is an actuator of therapy resistance. Cells in the endocycling state eventually undergo depolyploidization and repopulate the tumor, observed clinically as a recurrence. A common feature of cancers is centrosome amplification (CA) that includes aberrations in centrosome number (>2 centrosomes/cell), size, shape, and/or positioning. Our preliminary data has shown that endocycling cancer cells exhibit CA following treatment across multiple types of chemotherapies. Based upon this data, we hypothesize that studying centrosome dynamics and abnormalities presents a window into better understanding endocycle biology and this novel mechanism of therapy resistance.We have found that the population of prostate cancer and breast cancer cells possessing CA following treatment with LD50 dose of cisplatin or docetaxel increased as a function of recovery time to over 95% by day 10, with nearly all cells clustering extra centrosomes together. Of note, the number of mitotic skips an endocycling cell undergoes has not been found to be associated with the number of centrosomes the cell has. PLK4 is a kinase essential for centriole duplication and its overexpression causes CA. Immunofluorescence analysis has revealed that endocycling cancer cells exhibit an increase in PLK4 protein expression. Endocycling cancer cells also exhibit increased protein expression of KIFC1, a mediator of centrosome clustering. Both PLK4 and KIFC1 protein expression have been found to positively correlate with DNA content. We hypothesize that endocycling cells may use clustered, supernumerary centrosomes as platforms to locally concentrate signaling molecules, lowering the activation threshold for downstream effectors. Published data from bioID proteomics of centrosomal proteins has revealed an enormous unexplored protein landscape around these organelles. Because of this, CA may be a critical mechanism for endocycling cancer cells to survive and maintain this resistant cell state.

 Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality, characterized by its complexity and resistance to therapy. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a particularly aggressive subtype, lacks targeted therapies, making it challenging to treat. Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators in cancer biology, with lincRNA-BC7 identified as a potential modulator of BRCA1. However, the exact mechanisms through which lincRNA-BC7 interacts with BRCA1. This study investigated the functional role of lincRNA-BC7 in regulating BRCA1 activity and its contribution to the biological response of TNBC cells to Olaparib. Using in breast cancer in vitro models. The cell biological response of TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231) to Olaparib compared to the control group was evaluated. Gene expression analyses by RT-qPCR was done using LincRNA-BC-7 and BRCA1 specific primers. Furthermore, in silico bioinformatics analysis to map the molecular pathways involved was employed. This study revealed that miR-663a (has-miR-663a) could act as a sponge for lincRNA-BC7, thereby influencing its stability and expression levels. This interaction leads to alterations in the expression of target genes involved in key cancer hallmarks such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and metastasis. The competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks provide a framework for understanding how these non-coding RNAs interact at the post-transcriptional level, potentially affecting the progression of BRCA1-related breast cancer. Notably, both LincRNA-BC7 and BRCA1 gene expression levels were downregulated in Olaparib treated TNBC cells. Understanding the interplay between miR-663a and lincRNA-BC7and how this ceRNA network affects BRCA1 mutated TNBC may open avenues for novel therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent in breast cancer (BC) treatment regimens. Despite its frequent use, patient responses vary significantly. While several studies have identified clinically relevant genetic variants associated with CTX metabolism to phosphoramide mustard (PM)—the active cellular anti-tumor metabolite—the factors influencing sensitivity at the cellular level remain poorly characterized. We previously performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of lymphoblastoid cell lines identified the SNP rs12408401 as associated with PM resistance. Employing the 15-state chromatin prediction model, ChromHMM, and other in silico tools, we identified an association between this SNP and the disruption of a repressive CTCF binding domain in multiple tissue types, including breast. This leads to an upregulation of several nearby genes regulated by this motif, including RFX5. Analysis of TCGA BC patient data revealed that increased RFX5 expression correlates with reduced disease-free interval in breast cancer patients treated with CTX (HR = 5.32, P = 0.028), but not in other BC patients. RFX5 is a transcription factor that typically regulates the expression of MHC II-related genes. However, RFX5 has been reported to exhibit upregulation in several malignancies and off-target transcriptional activity. Herein, we aim to functionally validate the role of RFX5 in mediating CTX resistance, hypothesizing that decreased RFX5 expression will decrease drug resistance in vitro. To test this hypothesis, we achieved gene knockdown through the administration of silencing RNA (siRNA) targeting RFX5 then assessed sensitivity by treating cells with PM, determining cell viability to quantify IC50. As determined by qPCR, knockdown of RFX5 expression in the cell line MDA-MB-468 resulted in a 91% reduction in RFX5 expression compared to cells treated with scrambled siRNA (p = 0.004). At a PM concentration of 0.4 mM, RFX5 knockdown cells showed significantly reduced viability compared to scramble control cells (33.3 ± 4.5% vs. 49.6 ± 5.4%; p = 0.031). Furthermore, there was a 15% reduction in the IC50 of knockdown cells compared to control cells (0.273 ± 0.016 mM versus 0.346 ± 0.020 mM; P = 0.004). Together, these results provide strong evidence that RFX5 significantly attenuates CTX resistance. This work aims to link SNP genotype, gene expression, and drug sensitivity to improve predictive models of patient response and support targeted therapies enhancing CTX efficacy. Ongoing studies aim to delineate the pathways mediating aberrant RFX5 activity and validate its role in PM sensitivity across additional TNBC cell lines, with a focus on using CRISPRi to investigate the impact of genetic variation on the regulation RFX5 expression and RFX5 target genes.

 Background:
 The development of resistance is the one of the reason for ineffective treatment of soft tissue sarcomas (STSs). The search for new molecular-biological targets, both for the personalized selection of novel targeted drugs and for predicting chemoresistance of STSs to individual antitumor agents and their combinations, is a pressing task.
 Methods:
 In this study, an experimental in vitro chemoresistance analysis, whole-genome sequencing, and single-cell sequencing of tumors in patients (N = 9) with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas were performed. Chemotherapy resistance indices were determined for the obtained samples.
 Results:
 Whole-genome DNA sequencing yielded data on the type and frequency of somatic mutations in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, and driver genes of carcinogenesis were identified, among which the most frequently occurring were FCGBP, PARP4, TP53, RGPD3, PDE4DIP, and RB1. Correlations between the presence of genetic alterations and the response to chemotherapy in the in vitro test were sought. Thus, in samples resistant to the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide, the presence of mutations in the PEG3, USP8, NT5C3A, and WAS genes was characteristic. Bioinformatic analysis of single-cell transcriptome sequencing data, aimed at characterizing the population composition and transcriptomic landscape of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma cells, revealed 15 normal and 8 tumor cell populations. Among the populations of normal cells, the following clusters were identified: M2 and M1 macrophages, T-cells, matrix-remodeling fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, monocytes, stromal cells, endothelial cells, and osteoblasts. Among tumor cells, clusters of proliferating cells, hypoxic cells, matrix-interacting cells, and tumor cells with a stem-like phenotype were identified. The most common clusters in all samples were M2 macrophages, endothelial cells, and one of the clusters of tumor cells interacting with the matrix. Comparison of the expression profiles of cells from patients with different responses to chemotherapy allowed identification and characterization of clusters associated with chemosensitivity and chemoresistance. These included clusters of macrophages, tumor cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. In addition, genes common to all clusters associated with resistant samples were identified (ARGLU1, JUND, TNNT3, RHOB, CCNL2, LENG8, LUC7L3, KLF9, RSRP1, RNF213, SERPINE1, CDK5RAP3).
 Conclusions:
 The data obtained in this study will expand the understanding of the pathogenesis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas and the mechanisms underlying their development of chemotherapy resistance. In the future, this will serve as the basis for creating a test system to evaluate the expression levels of genes whose activation/repression is associated with the development of drug resistance in STSs.

 Background:
 Children with high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma (NB) need improved therapies, and recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, such as
 MYCN
 oncogene amplification, represent candidate therapeutic targets.
 MYCN
 amplification and increased
 MYCN
 expression drive deregulated hyper-transcription that leads to development and growth of NB tumors, and
 MYCN
 amplifications, which can be found both within the linear genome (HSR) and on circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), are associated with significantly worse survival rates for children with NB.
 MYCN
 overexpression has been linked to an increase in replication stress (RS), and RS and subsequent genome instability are important drivers of tumor initiation and progression. Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a non-essential DNA replication enzyme, was identified as a synthetic lethal target in
 BRCA1
 /
 2
 -deficient cancers via induction of RS. Recent success of targeting RS-elevated cancers with replication enzyme inhibitors opens a new avenue to target
 MYCN
 -amplified NB.
 Methods:
 Associations of gene expression with patient survival and prognostic features were performed on available neuroblastoma tumor databases using the R2 Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform. The efficacy of FEN1 inhibition was assessed using live cell imaging and cell viability assays, comparing results in
 MYCN
 -amplified to -nonamplified NB cells and in NB cells with inducible
 MYCN
 expression and repression. Mechanisms of cell death and impacts on replication stress in cells treated with FEN1 inhibitors were evaluated by Western blots.
 Results:
 We have found that
 FEN1
 expression levels are associated wtih NB patient outcomes and with features of high-risk disease, including tumor stage and
 MYCN
 amplification. FEN1 inhibition was effective against NB cells and was significantly more effective in
 MYCN
 -amplified NB cells causing reduced cell growth and viability. Increased
 MYCN
 expression also led to increased sensitivity to FEN1 inhibition, and reduced MYCN expression reduced sensitivity. FEN1 inhibition led to the induction of apoptosis but not necroptosis in NB cells and responses to FEN1 inhibition were associated with markers of replication stress, including activation of the ATR-CHK1 and ATM-CHK2 pathways.
 Conclusions:
 We have discovered that
 MYCN
 -amplified NB cells are hypersensitive to FEN1 inhibition, suggesting that FEN1 inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for children with high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma.

        <tr id="The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) Common Fund program was established to construct a reference database of human cancer cell lines responses to diverse multi-omics and phenotypic perturbations. As part of the LINCS initiative, 248 cell lines were profiled with the L1000 transcriptomics assay to measure the response to 33,621 small molecules and 7,508 single gene CRISPR knockouts (KOs). From this massive dataset, we computed sets of up- and down-regulated genes. These gene sets are served for search by the LINCS L1000 Signature Search (L2S2) platform. L2S2 provides instant results when searching across over 1.678 million chemical perturbations and CRISPR KO signatures. The platform includes filters for FDA-approved drugs and signature directionality. With the L2S2 search engine, users can identify small molecules and single gene CRISPR KOs that produce gene expression profiles similar or opposite to their submitted gene sets. Significant CRISPR KO signatures can reveal potential driver genes and drug targets. Similarly, approved drugs and preclinical small molecule signatures that might reverse or mimic a desired expression pattern can provide hypotheses for preclinical experimental validation studies. L2S2 also includes a consensus search feature which ranks specific perturbations across cellular contexts, time points, and concentrations. L2S2 was systematically applied to the CPTAC3 cohort to prioritize potential targets, approved drugs, and preclinical compounds for all previously identified multi-omic cancer cohort subtypes. Overall, L2S2 provides cancer researchers with a powerful tool to further understand and personalize treatments for cancer subtypes. L2S2 is available from: https://l2s2.maayanlab.cloud.

        <tr id="Melanomas have poor prognosis at the metastatic stage despite impressive progress in targeted- and immuno-therapies. Therefore, identification of novel critical genes involved in melanoma biology with targeting potential is desirable.
 We and others have previously demonstrated the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) as a dependency factor in various lymphocyte-derived cancers. These findings align with the therapeutic efficacy attained by immunomodulatory drugs which indirectly target IRF4 expression in these cancers.
 IRF4 also takes part in pigmentation in melanocytes, and its overexpression is prevalent in melanomas. Recently, we showed that high expression of IRF4 is linked to dependency in melanoma cells and mortality in patients. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that IRF4 regulates epigenetic silencing factors involved in DNA and histone H3K27 methylation, and consequently, controls the expression of melanoma-critical tumor suppressor genes and key downstream oncogenic pathways.
 In order to identify novel genes that melanoma cells rely on for survival or proliferation, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 drop-out screens. One set of screens was aimed at identifying single individual genes necessary for cell fitness. The other set of screens was aimed at uncovering genes, when knocked-out, compromised cell fitness synthetically with IRF4 deficiency. For each set, we screened in replicate two publicly available sub-genomic guide RNA libraries, one targeting genes involved in gene expression and the other targeting genes involved in apoptosis and cancer processes. In order to detect drop-outs between the start and the end of the experiments, we analyzed samples quantitatively via next generation sequencing of guides and the MAGeCK algorithm. Depletion of guides targeting core essential genes verified the screens’ ability to detect dependency genes. We then defined all significant dependency genes in their respective screens. We observed that, in addition to core essential genes, several genes that are deemed druggable show up as essential for melanoma cell fitness, some of which not previously reported. Several additional genes show up only in IRF4-knock out state, suggesting synthetic dependency. We followed up with pathway enrichment analyses to identify the prominent cellular pathways with dependency genes. Here, we observed gene transcription and translation, and cell cycle/mitosis as pathways enriched for melanoma dependency genes, among others. In addition, RNA processing and protein degradation are among the pathways enriched for dependency genes in the IRF4-knockout setting.
 The dependency genes uncovered in these CRISPR/Cas9 drop-out screens are expected to pave the way for novel targeting approaches in melanoma by themselves or in combination with IRF4.

 Synthetic lethality (SL) offers a promising avenue for cancer therapy by exploiting vulnerabilities unique to tumor cells and minimizing off-target effects on normal tissue. However, the application of SL-based therapies remains constrained by a limited repertoire of validated targets and biomarkers. Using data from the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) and advanced in silico modeling, Evariste’s Frobenius Target platform identified 50 potential SL gene pairs with druggable nodes and rational mechanisms linking targets and biomarkers. From this set, 24 gene pairs were prioritized for validation based on translational relevance and impact on the patient population.
 Validation was achieved through a collaborative high-throughput workflow with EditCo Bio, leveraging their CRISPR-based cell line engineering platform to generate 72 knockout pools in under three weeks. Validation studies in multiple cell lines demonstrated >10 high-confidence SL pairs, including a novel SL relationship involving focal adhesion kinase (FAK). To further substantiate this relationship, novel inhibitors were developed with best-in-class selectivity over the SL partner gene. Functional assays confirmed these inhibitors’ effectiveness in biomarker-low cell lines, with promising implications for clinical translation.
 This study highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches to uncover the next generation of SL targets, expanding the therapeutic landscape in cancer research. By focusing on biomarker-low gene expression as a predictor of SL, our work establishes a robust framework for the discovery and validation of clinically actionable SL relationships.

 Osimertinib is a 3rd generation EGFR inhibitor and the newest FDA approved adjuvant therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation. Although the drug can yield impressive initial responses, the majority of patients eventually progress due to the evolution of resistance. While the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance have been well studied, little is known about the ecological and evolutionary laws that govern the creation and subsequent expansion of these mutant populations. How frequently are different evolutionary routes taken and to what degree is evolution repeatable? To study the repeatability of osimertinib resistance evolution, we conducted a large-scale evolution experiment aimed at characterizing the distribution of resistant states that emerge, along with the pathways and vulnerabilities associated with their development. In our experimental design, we evolve PC-9, an EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell line to osimertinib independently 10 times (evolutionary replicates) for 10 cycles (serial passages). We also evolved 6 control replicates that undergo no treatment. At the end of the experiment, we will employ a multi-faceted approach to studying the resistance phenotype: 1) IC50 against osimertinib; 2) bulk RNA-seq; 3) DNA/mutational profiling; 4) a collateral sensitivity screening against 20 FDA approved drugs; and 5) a radiation sensitivity assay against 6 doses. The initial pretreatment dose response curve (DRC) against osimertinib showed a double plateau, suggesting the pre-existence of tolerant or even resistant subpopulation. In our control arms, we see consistent persistence of our double plateau throughout all 10 cycles, indicating this population is maintained in the absence of treatment but cannot expand. Conversely, across all 8 treated replicates we see a large shift in IC50 within the 1st treatment cycle, consistent with rapid selection and outgrowth of this population. More detailed analysis using time-lapse microscopy shows while these cells have a higher IC50, they also have a reduced growth rate, even if treatment is completely removed again (a “resistance cost”). This suggests potential evolutionary vulnerabilities which could be leveraged through strategic treatment breaks or drug sequences.

 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with poor treatment outcomes, in part due to epigenetic mechanisms driving tumor growth and resistance. Cell-free DNA methylome profiles in untreated SCLC can identify prognostic sub-groups, making it a useful biomarker. In this study, we hypothesize that changes in the cell free methylome of SCLC influence disease response to therapy and drive treatment resistance.



 Cell free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq) was performed on 34 baseline-relapse paired samples belonging to a cohort of SCLC patients treated at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (Toronto, Canada). Matched leukocyte DNA methylation profiles were incorporated to exclude the contribution of non-cancer methylation to the cfMeDIP signal and allow focused profiling of changes in the SCLC methylome through first-line treatment. The plasticity of the SCLC methylome was determined by subtracting the reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM) at the time of progression compared to the pre-treatment timepoint. A methylome demonstrated plasticity if it showed an increase or decrease in reads compared to the median RPKM across all samples in the cohort. Associations between methylation groups and relevant clinical data were identified. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were performed to determine if methylome changes were associated with overall survival and progression-free survival, anchored from the time of SCLC diagnosis. KEGG pathways corresponding to the top differentially methylated windows between baseline and relapse pairs were identified and characterized.



 Plasticity of the SCLC methylome were seen in 67% of patients (n=23/34). Methylome plasticity was found to be associated with a shorter time to progression from the end of first-line treatment (mean difference = 70 days; 95% CI 25-115, p = 0.0031). Accordingly, patients with greater methylome plasticity were more likely to be platinum resistant (57% vs. 17%; χ-squared p = 0.033). Cox regression showed that methylome plasticity was significantly associated with worse progression free survival (PFS) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 5.7, p = 0.0010) and overall survival (OS) (aHR = 1.9, p = 0.11), after adjusting for VA stage at diagnosis. Pathway analysis of differentially methylated windows mapped to genes related to neuronal polarity and axonal guidance, as well as Wnt signaling.



 Changes in cell-free DNA methylomes serve as a biomarker for treatment response in SCLC. Increased plasticity of the methylome is associated with shorter PFS. The underlying biology of this relationship may involve changes in pathways that govern neuronal change and established cancer-associated pathways.

 Adoptive cell therapy using engineered natural killer (NK) cells has emerged as a promising new treatment, with gene editing offering opportunities to further increase antitumor potency. However, strategies to address both intrinsic and extrinsic therapeutic barriers remain largely unexplored. To address this, we developed a pooled CRISPR discovery platform to identify genetic perturbations that can be exploited for CAR-NK cellular engineering strategies.
 Using primary human NK cells, we performed multiple genome-wide CRISPR screens under conditions of repeated tumor challenge, relevant to the tumor microenvironment (TME). These screens uncovered novel NK cell checkpoints that regulate resistance to tumor-induced and TME-driven immunosuppression. High-content screening in NK cells with enhanced degranulation capacity validated these findings, identifying phenotypic correlates of how reprogrammed NK cells acquire enhanced potency. Cross-validation of top screen hits in a large patient cohort across 17 diverse cancer types demonstrated transcriptional upregulation of top hits compared to healthy donors, underscoring their clinical relevance.
 Key pathways enriched among the hits included components of the Cul5-RING ubiquitin ligase, the Mediator and the SAGA complexes, as well as genes involved in chromatin remodeling and negative regulation of NFκB. These findings highlight transcriptional reprogramming and post- translational modification (PTM) components as means to optimize NK cell effector functions for enhanced anticancer immunity.
 Targeted ablation of top hits MED12, ARIH2 and CCNC markedly improved the antitumor potency of both non-transduced and CAR/IL-15-engineered NK cells against multiple hard-to-treat cancers using two different IL-15-armored CAR receptors targeting CD70 and TROP2. ARIH2 and CCNC deficient TROP2/IL-15-CAR-NK cells displayed enhanced metabolic fitness and a marked increase in activated/cytotoxic clusters (DNAM-1high, Granzyme Bhigh, Perforinhigh, CD69high), with a concomitant decrease in inhibitory subsets (NKG2Ahigh, Granzyme Blow, CD69low), as shown by mass cytometry.
 Multiplexed ARIH2/CCNC editing of TROP2/IL-15-CAR-NK cells significantly increased NK cell expansion, tumor bed infiltration, release of cytotoxic granules and antitumor efficacy in an orthotopic in vivo mouse model of pancreatic cancer. This was accompanied by the induction of cytotoxic (CD16high, Granzyme Bhigh, Perforinhigh) and activated (DNAM-1high, CD69high, NKG2Dhigh) NK cell subsets.
 In conclusion, by applying high-content genome-wide CRISPR screening in primary human NK cells, this study revealed novel regulators of NK cell function, including MED12, ARIH2 and CCNC. Targeting these regulators enhances CAR-NK cell metabolic fitness, cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor efficacy, offering new opportunities for optimizing CAR-NK therapies.

 In cancer cells, chromatin replication is often misregulated in part due to mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, leading to increased replication stress and genomic instability. While this instability drives cancer progression, it also makes cancer cells more dependent on genome maintenance pathways, presenting a therapeutic target. A promising strategy is to exacerbate replication stress, causing lethal genome instability. We have developed a sensitive reporter to monitor replication stress via single-stranded DNA at stressed forks. Our earlier study identified Tousled-like kinases (TLKs) crucial for chromatin assembly during genome replication and discovered TLK inhibitors to treat cancers through increasing replication stress. Additionally, we recently uncovered histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) inhibitors that disrupt chromatin replication and compromise genome integrity, particularly when combined with checkpoint kinase inhibitors. In this presentation, I will show you how HDAC8 behaves as caretakers of genetic and epigenetic integrity and how we targeted replication stress to create cancer-specific synergistic vulnerabilities.

 Background:
 Lynch syndrome (LS), caused by germline pathogenic variants (gPVs) in DNA mismatch repair genes (
 MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2
 ), is characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) of associated tumors. The impact of the underlying gPV on the prognosis of LS patients with advanced cancer receiving ICB has not been elucidated.
 Methods:
 Consecutive cancer-affected LS pts consented to tumor-normal DNA sequencing via MSK-IMPACT (NCT01775072), from 01/2014-01/2024 with advanced solid tumors and receiving ≥1 ICB dose were identified. In cases of multiple cancers, only the first one was considered. MSI and MMRd was assessed via NGS-derived MSISensor score or IHC staining, respectively. Radiological response rates and survival were assessed.
 Results:
 Among 186 LS patients, 132 had an ICB treated advanced tumor with the following prevalence of gPV:
 MSH2
 41% (N=54),
 MLH1
 28%

 (N=37),
 PMS2
 17% (N=23), and
 MSH6
 14% (N=18). The most represented tumor types were colorectal (35%, N=46), urothelial (14%, N=18), pancreatic/biliary (13%, N=17), upper gastro-intestinal (11%, N=15), endometrial (11%, N=15). Objective response rate was 58%, including 35% with radiological complete response (CR) with higher CR rates in g
 MLH1
 and g
 MSH2
 patients (Table). Median follow-up was 53 months [range:0.3-116.3]. Median overall survival (mOS) / Progression free survival (mPFS) were significantly prolonged in
 non-gPMS2
 patients vs. g
 PMS2
 patients (Table). MMR IHC was available for 107 (80%) tumors identifying 88% (n=94) as MMRd and 12% (n=13) as MMRp tumors. 69% (9/13) of MMRp tumors were in
 PMS2
 patients with 8 being both MMRp and MSS suggesting a sporadic origin rather than LS-related cancer. Stratifying by MMRd and MSI status, mOS was similar in patients with MMRd/MSI and MMRd/MSS tumors (109 months vs not reached (NR); HR=0.86; 95%CI [0.35-2.13]), but significantly diminished in in pts with MMRp as compared to MMRd tumors (20 vs 109 months, HR=0.27; 95%CI [0.77-0.96]). In g
 PMS2
 patients with MMRd tumors, median OS was 27.7 months.
 Conclusions:
 ICB treatment results in high CR rates in LS patients. The shorter mOS amongst LS patients with
 gPMS2
 compared to other LS genes is partially explained by the higher prevalence of sporadic MMRp tumors. Even in the context of an MMRd tumor, patients with g
 PMS2
 have worse outcomes than LS patients with other gPVs.

 Although anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy has established efficacy in RAS/BRAF wild type (WT) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), a significant proportion (30-50%) of WT patients exhibit primary resistance to this treatment. Existing biomarker discovery has predominantly focused on tumor-specific DNA mutations, which suffer from variable mutation frequencies among patients. In contrast, DNA methylation represents a common and early event in carcinogenesis. For this reason, methylation markers hold great promise for detecting resistance mechanisms in primary tumors. Several studies have shown an association between DNA methylation patterns and resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in CRC. To validate and build upon these findings, we investigated the methylomes of primary tumors with resistant and responsive phenotypes.



 We isolated DNA from FFPE tissue of 40 primary CRC tumors. DNA was subjected to bisulfite conversion and Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 BeadChip (Illumina). Subsequently, ChAMP was used to determine the methylation values (β values) and perform differential methylation analysis. The CpG sites were ranked based on the largest Δβ values and the significance of p-values across the patient groups. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we performed a false discovery rate (FDR) evaluation using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, which led to the selection of a subset of differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) with the highest likelihood of being genuine associations. Additionally, a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed with methylGSA.



 48 DMCs were identified with adjusted p-values < 0.05. The affected genes are involved in cancer progression and invasiveness, suggesting a role in a yet-to-be discovered resistance mechanism. The GSEA revealed significant enrichment in 53 KEGG and 33 Reactome pathways, including MAPK-related and Akt signaling pathways. There were 470 significant gene ontology (GO) pathways: 347 in biological processes, 71 in cellular components and 52 in molecular functions.



 We have found methylation sites associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in CRC patients. In addition to identifying critical DMCs, the pathways uncovered hold potential as a rich source of predictive biomarkers. Next, we will include 24 additional patients. When increasing the sample size, we expect a higher statistical power and an enrichment of CpGs with significant p-values. Afterwards, we will independently validate the most significant CpG sites in a follow-up study using a highly sensitive multiplexed droplet digital PCR assay on additional tissue biopsies.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with T cell-cold tumors experience rapid cancer progression and poor survival. While T cell-enhancing immunotherapies have improved outcomes for a subset of CRC patients, most remain nonresponsive. Therefore, better understanding the mechanisms that drive T cell dysfunction in CRC is needed. We used matched gene expression and copy number profiles from TCGA to evaluate CRC tumors (N=373) based on measures of T cell infiltrate, and developed a method to identify genes with potential roles in T cell exclusion. Leveraging the intersect between copy number amplification and gene expression in the T cell-cold state, we pinpointed a region of chromosome 20q11.21 where DNA- and RNA-levels were more strongly correlated with T cell exclusion than anywhere else in the CRC genome. This locus also contained the most frequently amplified and overexpressed genes in the CRC genome. Within this region, Protein O-Fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) was the most distinguished gene, and correlated with CTL inhibition across 12/24 solid tumor types annotated in TCGA (SKCM, THCA, COAD, READ, LUSC, CESC, KIRC, STAD, HNSC, KIRP, LIHC, UCEC; p<0.0001). Stable overexpression of POFUT1 (POFUT1-OE) in MC38 mouse colon cancer cells enhanced proliferation relative to MC38-Vector (RTCA p<0.0001, CellTiterGlo p=0.0011); and in co-culture with c57BL/6 spleen-derived PBMCs, CD8+ T cell populations from MC38-POFUT1-OE co-cultures were significantly reduced over the course of 7 days. This effect persisted when PBMCs were stimulated with IL-2 and anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 in 50% conditioned medium (CM) from MC38-POFUT1-OE, prompting us to profile the CM for differences in secretomes. Of 110 profiled cytokines, two were at significantly higher levels in MC38-POFUT1-OE CM: IL-6 and IL-23 (p=0.0003, p=0.0055). These results were validated via ELISA and transient knockdown (KD) of POFUT1, where POFUT1-KD resulted in reduced cancer cell proliferation, diminished secretion of IL-6, and increased CD8+ T cell abundance in our CM models. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated KD of POFUT1 in MDST8 and HCT15 human CRC cell lines resulted in significant reductions in secreted IL-6 (p=0.0003, p<0.0001). Treatment of murine PBMCs with IL-6 (5.0 pg/mL - 50 ng/mL) decreased the proportion of CD8+ T cells to an analogous level as culture with POFUT1-OE CM. The decrease in CD8+ T cell proportion was also associated with less proliferation (CFSE, p=0.0049), and reduced surface expression of activating co-receptors CD25 and CD69 (p=0.1008, p=0.0015). Dosing with anti-IL-6 IgG (10 ng/mL) reversed the decrease in CD8+ T cell proliferation induced by CM from MC38-POFUT1-OE, establishing IL-6 as the downstream mechanism of POFUT1-dependent inhibition of CD8+ T cell activity. Together, these findings link POFUT1 amplification in CRC with dysregulation of CD8+ T cells via upregulation of cancer-intrinsic IL-6 secretion.

 Background:
 MTAP
 loss leads to methylthioadenosine (MTA) accumulation, disrupting downstream metabolic pathways. Targeting synthetic lethal interactions with
 MTAP
 loss offers a promising therapeutic strategy. The DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, essential for genomic stability, is commonly dysregulated in lung cancer, impacting treatment response and prognosis. Emerging evidence has highlighted potential association between
 MTAP
 loss and mutations in DDR genes, suggesting that investigating their relationship is critical for uncovering disease mechanisms and identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
 Methods:
 Hybridization capture sequencing with StarPanel NGS Assay (1,326 genes) was conducted on 2,258 Chinese lung cancer patients' tumor and matched peripheral blood samples. Then somatic and germline mutations, and TMB values of each sample were obtained. Based on a depth-based algorithm, differences between tissue and control samples in CNVs from the gene level were analyzed. Besides, we utilized shifts in germline heterozygous SNPs within the gene region to assist in determining if the loss was homozygous or heterozygous.
 Results:
 Homozygous and heterozygous deletions of
 MTAP
 were detected in 11.07% and 6.95% of all samples. Notably, 61.67% of these samples exhibited co-loss of
 MTAP
 ,
 CDKN2A
 and
 CDKN2B
 . The median TMB was significantly higher in samples with
 MTAP
 loss (3.85 mut/Mb) compared to those with intact
 MTAP
 (2.56 mut/Mb). In samples with homozygous
 MTAP
 loss, the top somatically co-altered genes were
 EGFR
 (76.00%),
 TP53
 (57.60%) and
 CDKN2A
 (52.80%). Gain-of-function (GoF) mutations were most prevalent in
 EGFR
 (56.80%),
 KRAS
 (12.00%) and
 MDM2
 (10.00%), while Loss-of-function (LoF) mutations were most common in
 TP53
 (50.40%),
 RBM10
 (11.60%) and
 PTEN
 (7.60%). Notably, LoF mutations in
 MTAP
 -loss samples showed a higher prevalence of DDR genes compared to
 MTAP
 -intact samples, including
 RAD50
 (2.40% vs. 0.00%,
 p
 < .0001) and
 POLQ
 (2.40% vs. 0.00%,
 p
 < .0001). Enrichment analysis further revealed LoF mutations unique to
 MTAP
 -loss samples were significantly enriched in the DDR pathway (
 p
 < .0001). For top germline pathogenic mutations, two DDR genes,
 RECQL4
 (0.80% vs. 0.38%,
 p
 = 0.29) and
 BRCA2
 (0.40% vs. 0.43%,
 p
 = 1), showed no significant differences between
 MTAP
 -loss and
 MTAP
 -intact samples.
 Conclusions:
 Potential association exists between
 MTAP
 loss and DDR pathway dysregulation, which may impact tumorigenic processes and therapeutic vulnerabilities. The enrichment of DDR-related LoF mutations indicates
 MTAP
 loss could exacerbate genomic instability by impairing DNA damage repair mechanisms, thereby increasing TMB and driving cancer progression with a distinct molecular profile. These vulnerabilities are primarily driven by somatic mutations, providing a rationale for exploring personalized treatment strategies.

 The Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) is an ongoing initiative to identify and explore synthetic lethal targets, by systematically linking tumor molecular alterations to gene dependencies and drug sensitivities. The resource used by scientists worldwide has significantly contributed to both basic and translational cancer research and has provided the community with a landscape view of synthetic lethal targets. Numerous targets identified through DepMap are actively under investigation, with several already advancing into clinical trials, highlighting their clinical relevance and potential. For instance, we recently discovered a synthetic lethal interaction involving the PELO-HBS1L and SKI complex, both involved in mRNA quality control. PELO is a promising synthetic lethal target in cancers with SKI complex deficiencies, such as those with FOCAD deletions or high microsatellite instability. Despite the progress, much work remains to fully exploit cancer dependencies. We have integrated next-generation patient-derived models, including organoids and neurospheres grown in 3D to better represent various cancer subtypes. Additionally, we used di-genic screening libraries to uncover synthetic lethal dependencies previously masked due to paralog redundancy. We are also actively expanding multi-omics datasets and building computational features that will enable the identification of novel molecular links to synthetic lethal dependencies. DepMap continues to grow with the ultimate goal of creating a comprehensive and detailed landscape of cancer vulnerabilities to accelerate precision cancer medicine.

 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous malignancy characterized by genetic and epigenetic dysregulation, including aberrant activity of chromatin modifiers. The complex interactions among these modifiers and regulators in AML pathogenesis remain poorly understood, posing significant challenges to developing effective combination therapies. To address this, we used Perturb-seq, a CRISPR-based single-cell transcriptomics approach, to profile 16 key genes from the Menin-MLL, Polycomb, and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes in the MOLM-13 AML cell line. We developed a machine learning framework called Composer, which predicts the combinatorial effects of perturbations by analyzing their impact on the transcriptome. We identified cooperative regulation of oncogenic pathways by Menin-MLL and KAT6A, while PRC1 components, such as PCGF1, were found to antagonize DOT1L activity. These predictions were validated using bulk RNA-seq and experiments combining perturbations through small molecule inhibitors and gene knockouts, demonstrating that dual inhibition of Menin-MLL and KAT6A, or DOT1L and KAT6A, significantly reduced AML cell viability. This study underscores the power of combining AI with single-cell Perturb-seq to provide novel insight into the epigenetic landscape of AML and identify promising therapeutic targets to overcome treatment resistance.

 CRISPR screens have been successfully used to identify targetable genes for anti-cancer research and drug development. Typically, CRISPR screens are conducted in vitro on cell lines, which do not fully capture the influence of the in vivo physiological environment. It is well known that any genetic editing might trigger the adjustment of gene balance to compensate for the modifications in the target cells and tissues. To address the complexity of cellular interactions and the immunological response, in vivo CRISPR screening on a xenograft model is a compelling approach to unravel biological processes where cells are targeted within their natural physiological conditions.



 We have conducted a CRISPR screening approach using the human non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 by knocking out tumor suppressor genes using a library of 3, 188 single guide RNAs (sgRNA). Subsequently, in vivo testing was carried out with the genetically edited A549 cells with or without treatment with the kinase inhibitor Trametinib. At the study endpoint, tumor samples were isolated and analyzed. Amplicon sequencing was used to capture residual sgRNA. MAGeCK was used to calculate the gene enrichment score.



 After CRISPR editing, 37 sgRNA corresponding to 20 genes were captured in the edited A549 cell line. In the vehicle-treated A549 xenograft tumors, 45 sgRNA corresponding to 27 genes were captured, of which 17 genes were overlapping with engineered A549 cell culture, 8 upregulated and 9 downregulated. In comparison, in the A549 xenograft tumors of the Trametinib treated group, 38 sgRNA corresponding to 23 genes were discovered, with 15 overlapping genes, 9 upregulated and 6 downregulated. The change in expression levels was abundant. Of the 3, 188 sgRNA, the majority of sgRNAs were filtered out in the A549 cell line, under in vivo evolution and the influence of Trametinib treatment. We believe that the pathways related to this small set of identified genes may reveal potential new targets for anti-cancer research and drug development.



 The in vivo CRISPR approach offers a valuable and translational tool for discovering novel targets in cancer research, providing insights for new anti-cancer therapies.

        <tr id="Background Ovarian cancer is one of the most common malignancies of the female reproductive system and is associated with poor prognosis. This study aimed to utilize single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the heterogeneity of malignant epithelial cells in ovarian cancer, focusing on their potential functions and the implications for treatment and prognosis. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing data were clustered using a single-cell transcriptome clustering method, and malignant epithelial cells were identified through copy number variation analysis. The interaction patterns between different malignant subpopulations and immune/stromal cells were analyzed using cell-to-cell communication analysis. A risk score (URS) model based on the UBE2C + epithelial subpopulation was then constructed through LASSO and multivariable Cox regression. High and low URS groups were compared in terms of tumor mutational burden (TMB), survival outcomes, and drug sensitivity. Finally, the role of GTF2F2 in ovarian cancer progression was validated through gene knockdown experiments in an ovarian cancer cell line (ES-2). Results Three major malignant epithelial cell subpopulations were identified (TMSB4X + Epi, TSC22D1 + Epi, and UBE2C + Epi). The UBE2C + Epi subpopulation exhibited higher stemness and greater invasive potential. The constructed URS model effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group displaying a higher TMB level (p = 0.00011). Drug sensitivity predictions indicated that osimertinib, rapamycin, and dihydrorotenone might have stronger inhibitory effects in the high-risk group, whereas ERK inhibitors were more effective in the low-risk group. Functional assays demonstrated that GTF2F2 knockdown significantly suppressed ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion. Western blot analyses further showed elevated E-cadherin and reduced N-cadherin expression, suggesting that GTF2F2 may promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Conclusion The risk score model established in this study offers a novel framework for patient stratification and personalized therapy. Notably, the identification of the UBE2C + Epi subpopulation and key genes such as GTF2F2 highlights potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets, shedding light on the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer and paving the way for precision medicine approaches.

        <tr id="Background Recent research has identified a potential protective effect of higher numbers of circulating lymphocytes on colorectal cancer (CRC) development. However, the importance of different lymphocyte subtypes and activation states in CRC development and the biological pathways driving this relationship remain poorly understood and warrant further investigation. Specifically, CD4+ T cells -- a highly dynamic lymphocyte subtype -- undergo remodelling upon activation to induce the expression of genes critical for their effector function. Previous studies investigating their role in CRC risk have used bulk tissue, limiting our current understanding of the role of these cells to static, non-dynamic relationships only. Methods Here, we combined two genetic epidemiological methods -- Mendelian randomisation (MR) and genetic colocalisation -- to evaluate evidence for causal relationships of gene expression on CRC risk across multiple CD4+ T cell subtypes and activation stage. Genetic proxies were obtained from single-cell transcriptomic data, allowing us to investigate the causal effect of expression of 1,805 genes across five CD4+ T cell activation states on CRC risk (78,473 cases; 107,143 controls). We repeated analyses stratified by CRC anatomical subsites and sex, and performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate whether the observed effect estimates were likely to be CD4+ T cell-specific. Results We identified six genes with evidence (FDR-P<0.05 in MR analyses and H4>0.8 in genetic colocalisation analyses) for a causal role of CD4+ T cell expression in CRC development -- FADS2, FHL3, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB5, RPL28, and TMEM258 . We observed differences in causal estimates of gene expression on CRC risk across different CD4+ T cell subtypes and activation timepoints, as well as CRC anatomical subsites and sex. However, our sensitivity analysis revealed that the genetic proxies used to instrument gene expression in CD4+ T cells also act as eQTLs in other tissues, highlighting the challenges of using genetic proxies to instrument tissue-specific expression changes. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the importance of capturing the dynamic nature of CD4+ T cells in understanding disease risk, and prioritises genes for further investigation in cancer prevention research.">

        <tr id="Eliciting DNA damage in tumor cells continues to be one of the most successful strategies against cancer. This is the case for classical chemotherapy drugs and radiotherapy. In the modern era of personalized medicine, this strategy tries to identify specific vulnerabilities found in each patient’s tumor, to inflict DNA damage in certain cell contexts that end up in massive cancer cell death. Cells rely on multiple DNA repair pathways to fix DNA damage, but cancer cells frequently exhibit defects in these pathways, many times being tolerant to the damage. Key vulnerabilities, such as BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, have been exploited with PARP inhibitors, leveraging synthetic lethality to selectively kill tumor cells and improving patients’ survival. In the DNA damage response (DDR) network, kinases ATM, ATR, Chk1, and Chk2 coordinate DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Inhibiting these proteins enhances tumor sensitivity to DNA-damaging therapies, especially in DDR-deficient cancers. Several small-molecule inhibitors targeting ATM/Chk2 or ATR/Chk1 are currently being tested in preclinical and/or clinical settings, showing promise in cancer models and patients. Additionally, pharmacological blockade of ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 axes enhances the effects of immunotherapy by increasing tumor immunogenicity, promoting T-cell infiltration and activating immune responses. Combining ATM/Chk2- or ATR/Chk1-targeting drugs with conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors offers a compelling strategy to improve treatment efficacy, overcome resistance, and enhance patients’ survival in modern oncology.">

 Synthetic lethality, a phenomenon in which alterations in two or more genes together induce cell death while changes in either gene alone do not, provides a promising approach for cancer treatment. Indeed, various inhibitors targeting synthetic lethal interactions are approved by the Food and Drug Administration or in clinical trials. Seeking to nominate additional synthetic lethal targets, we analyzed large-scale CRISPR knockout screening data and identified Pelota mRNA surveillance and ribosome rescue factor (PELO) as a promising therapeutic target for two independent and frequently observed molecular subtypes of cancer: biallelic deletion of chromosomal region 9p21.3 (9p21.3-/-) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).
 Homozygous deletion of chromosomal region 9p21.3 is one of the most frequently observed somatic copy number alterations in human cancers, occurring in approximately 15% of all cancers. Many 9p21.3-/- cancers are associated with poor clinical outcomes including subsets of glioblastoma, mesothelioma, urothelial, pancreatic, esophageal, and non-small cell lung cancers. The primary driver of 9p21.3-/- is thought to be loss of the tumor suppressor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A. Additionally, studies have linked the loss of the interferon gene cluster on 9p21.3 to immune evasion and primary resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Extensive deletions of chromosomal regions can provide opportunities for cancer treatment. For instance, PRMT5 and MAT2A were found to be promising targets in 9p21.3-/- cancers due to synthetic lethal interactions with deletions of the 9p21.3 gene methylthioadenosine phosphorylase. While clinical trials are underway examining PRMT5 and MAT2A inhibitors, the frequency and poor outcomes of many 9p21.3−/− cancers underscores the urgent need for additional therapies to treat this diverse group of cancers. Using large-scale functional genomic datasets, we identified PELO as the top preferential dependency in 9p21.3-/- cell lines.
 We also observed that some cell lines with intact 9p21.3 (9p21.3+) were dependent on PELO for survival. Examining other genomic features, we found that these cells were characterized as MSI-H, a hypermutable state observed in subsets of colon, endometrial, gastric, and ovarian cancers. Indeed, when we compared 9p21.3+/MSI-H and 9p21.3+/microsatellite stable (MSS) cell lines, we found that PELO scored as a strong preferential dependency in MSI-H cell lines, second only to the previously described synthetic lethal target Werner helicase (WRN).
 To validate these findings, we interrogated the viability effects of PELO knockdown across a panel of cell lines representing 9p21.3+/MSS, 9p21.3-/-/MSS, or 9p21.3+/MSI-H. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-mediated PELO knockdown with three distinct guide RNAs impaired the viability of 9p21.3-/-/MSS cell lines and 9p21.3+/MSI-H cell lines, but not 9p21.3+/MSS cell lines. We also sought to validate PELO dependency in tumor organoid models for which pre-existing CRISPR data were unavailable, and therefore, we could only predict their dependence on PELO based on the two identified biomarkers. We demonstrated that 9p21.3-/- or MSI-H tumor organoids were preferentially dependent on PELO as compared to 9p21.3+/MSS models. We also sought to evaluate the effect of PELO knockdown in tumor maintenance in vivo. Leveraging a doxycycline-inducible CRISPRi system to suppress PELO expression, we showed that PELO knockdown significantly shrank 9p21.3-/- tumors grown on the flanks of nude mice.
 We next pursued the culprit lesion in 9p21.3-/- cancers that conferred PELO dependency. Hypothesizing that the loss of a 9p21.3 gene confers PELO dependency, we performed a focused loss-of-function CRISPR/Cas12a screen targeting 9p21.3 genes in the context of PELO knockdown or control conditions. We identified the mRNA surveillance gene FOCAD as a 9p21.3 gene whose knockout lead to preferential impairment in cells with PELO depletion. This led us to hypothesize that FOCAD deletions were conferring PELO dependency. In focused validation, we showed that FOCAD deletion sensitizes cell lines to PELO knockdown. Furthermore, we discovered that restoring FOCAD rescued 9p21.3-/- cells from PELO depletion. Together, these data demonstrated FOCAD loss was both necessary and sufficient for PELO dependency in the 9p21.3-/- context.
 Next, we sought to determine the mechanistic basis for PELO dependency in MSI-H cancers. We hypothesized that a mutation associated with MSI-H sensitizes cells to PELO loss. We observed that deletions in the splicing acceptor site at intron 29 of the superkiller complex (SKIc) member tetratricopeptide repeat domain 37 (TTC37) was the most correlated microsatellite mutation with PELO dependency. Thymidine deletions in this splicing acceptor site were predictive of decreased TTC37 protein levels in cell lines. These data led us to hypothesize that functional loss of TTC37 is the culprit lesion that renders MSI-H cancers dependent on PELO for survival. Evaluating this hypothesis, we found that TTC37 knockout sensitized cells to PELO depletion. We also showed that exogenous expression of TTC37, but not control, cDNA rescued the viability of MSI-H cell lines from PELO knockdown. Taken together, these data demonstrated that functional TTC37 impairment is sufficient and necessary for PELO dependency in the MSI-H setting and could serve as a refined predictive biomarker for PELO dependency.
 We next sought to investigate how FOCAD loss and TTC37 mutations converge to confer PELO dependency. TTC37 interacts with Ski2-like RNA helicase (SKIV2L) and WD Repeat Containing Protein 61 (WDR61) to form the SKIc, which promotes the 3’-5’ exosome degradation of mRNA from stalled ribosomes. We examined the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia proteomics dataset and demonstrated positive correlations between FOCAD, TTC37, and SKIV2L. Consistent with these datasets, we observed decreased TTC37 and SKIV2L protein levels in 9p21.3-/- cell lines and MSI-H cell lines. Based on these results, we asked if FOCAD was required and/or sufficient to maintain TTC37 and SKIV2L protein stability. We expressed FOCAD cDNA in 9p21.3-/- cells and observed increased TTC37 and SKIV2L protein levels. Furthermore, FOCAD knockout reduced SKIV2L and TTC37 protein levels in 9p21.3+/MSS cells. Together, these data support FOCAD as a critical regulator of SKIV2L and TTC37 stability. We hypothesized that FOCAD deletions and TTC37 mutations were capturing SKIc loss, thereby increasing reliance on PELO for survival. We reasoned that if functional loss of the SKIc was responsible for PELO dependency, SKIV2L deletion would also confer increased PELO dependency. We knocked SKIV2L out and observed that loss of SKIV2L sensitized cells to PELO loss. These data support our hypothesis that loss of SKIc function confers increased dependence on PELO for survival.
 To assess how SKIc-deficient cancer cells respond to PELO suppression, we performed gene expressing profiling. We found that SKIc-deficient cells had a robust transcriptional response with gene set enrichment analyses demonstrating upregulation of the unfolded protein response, a signaling network responding to aggregated unfolded or misfolded proteins. We validated these findings by demonstrating that PELO depletion preferentially upregulated C/ebp homologous protein (CHOP) expression and induced X-BOX binding protein (XPB1) splicing, markers of UPR activation, in the SKIc-deficient setting.
 Together, our observations reveal that MSI-H associated mutations and large 9p21.3 deletions involving TTC37 and FOCAD, respectively, independently impair the SKIc and confer a synthetic lethal relationship with PELO. Since MSI-H and large 9p21.3 deletions are frequently observed in patients, a PELO-based therapeutic could have broad implications for clinical oncology.

        <tr id="Background: The increasing global incidence of breast cancer calls for the identification of new therapeutic targets and the assessment of possible neem-derived inhibitors by means of computational modeling and integrated genomic research. Methods: Originally looking at 59,424 genes throughout 42 samples, we investigated gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas—Breast Cancer (TCGA-BRCA) dataset. We chose 286 genes for thorough investigation following strict screening for consistent expression. R’s limma package was used in differential expression analysis. The leading candidate’s protein modeling was done with Swiss-ADME and Discovery Studio. Molecular docking studies, including 132 neem compounds, were conducted utilizing AutoDock Vina. Results: Among the 286 examined, mitochondrially encoded cytochrome C oxidase III (MT—CO3) turned out to be the most greatly overexpressed gene, showing consistent elevation across all breast cancer samples. Protein modeling revealed a substantial hydrophobic pocket (volume: 627.3 Å3) inside the structure of MT—CO3. Docking investigations showed five interesting neem-derived inhibitors: 7-benzoylnimbocinol, nimolicinol, melianodiol, isonimocinolide, and stigmasterol. Strong binding affinities ranging from −9.2 to −11.5 kcal/mol and diverse interactions with MT—CO3, mostly involving the residues Phe214, Arg221, and Trp58, these molecules displayed. With hydrophobic interactions dominant across all chemicals, fragment contribution analysis revealed that scaffold percentage greatly influences binding effectiveness. Stigmasterol revealed greater drug-likeness (QED = 0.79) despite minimal interaction variety, while 7-benzoylnimbocinol presented the best-balanced physicochemical profile. Conclusion: Connecting traditional medicine with current genomics and computational biology, this work proposes a methodology for structure-guided drug design and development using neem-derived chemicals and finds MT—CO3 as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.">

 Oncogenic fusion genes and amplified oncogenes are common drivers of cancer but there are currently no therapeutic approaches available that directly target these cancer-specific genomic features. Amplified oncogenes in cancer can be found on chromosomes as homologous staining regions (HSRs) or on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Presence of oncogenes on ecDNA poses a particular challenge because they are under strong positive selection in response to anti-cancer therapies leading to treatment resistance as their copy number can rapidly change due to uncontrolled segregation during cell division. To specifically target cells with fusions or amplified oncogenes, we have developed a CRISPR-based therapeutic approach, “KLIPP, ” which is designed to target structural variants junctions (SVJs) specific to cancer genomes, with few, or no off-target effects expected in normal cell. KLIPP uses a “split enzyme” approach consisting of a dead Cas9 endonuclease (dCas9) fused to the endonuclease Fok1 where two Fok1 endonucleases need to homodimerize to become active. To “nucleate” and activate these complexes, sgRNAs are designed to bind sequences flanking cancer-specific SVJs, bringing two Fok1-dCas9 complexes together to induce double-strand breaks (DSBs). Using the KLIPP approach, we have obtained strong proof-of-concept that it can specifically target cancer-unique SVJs and induce DSBs leading to cell death in cancer cells both in culture and in vivo. We have shown this for SVJs throughout cancer genomes as well as in oncogenic fusion genes such as EWS-FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma. Furthermore, we show that we can use KLIPP to target unique SVJs on amplified oncogenes resulting in strong induction of γH2AX and loss of cell survival. We are currently investigating the efficacy of KLIPP in targeting ecDNA in cancer cells. We believe that KLIPP could be a safe and cancer-specific precision therapy for targeting cancer cells driven by fusions and amplified oncogenes.

 Background
 Chromosomal instability (CIN) is pervasive during cancer evolution, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) where it is associated with poor recurrence-free survival and correlates with the frequency of whole genome doubling events (WGD). By duplicating the complete set of chromosomes, WGD is a key event during cancer evolution and correlates with poor prognosis and targeted therapy resistance. Despite the importance of these events, genetic events responsible for the initiation and maintenance of CIN and WGD in NSCLC have not been systematically investigated.
 Methods
 TRAcking Cancer Evolution through Therapy/Rx (TRACERx) is a multicancer longitudinal study which utilizes multiregional sampling and whole exome sequencing (WES) to elucidate potential causes of tumor heterogeneity and cancer progression. TRACERx enables us to investigate genetic alterations and their relationship with WGD and CIN, and proceed to functionally characterize them.
 Results
 We identified that genetic alterations in 6 genes, including FAT1, results in homologous recombination (HR) repair deficiencies and CIN. Mutations in FAT1 are further associated with HR deficiency in patient cohorts. Using orthogonal genetic and experimental approaches, we demonstrate that FAT1 alterations are positively selected before WGD in lung cancer evolution. FAT1 ablation causes persistent replication stress, an elevated mitotic failure rate, nuclear deformation, and elevated structural CIN including chromosome translocations and radial chromosomes. Furthermore, FAT1 loss contributes to WGD, which we attribute to the dysregulation of YAP1. Co-depletion of the oncogene YAP1 partially reduces the elevated numerical CIN caused by FAT1 loss but does not relieve HR deficiencies nor structural CIN. Importantly, overexpression of constitutively active YAP15SA is sufficient to induce numerical CIN. HR deficiencies and high CIN caused by FAT1 loss synergizes with WGD to fuel tumor evolution, a prominent factor underpinning therapy resistance.
 Conclusions
 These data suggest that FAT1 loss in lung cancer attenuates HR repair and exacerbates structural and numerical CIN through two distinct downstream mechanisms, leading to increased tumor heterogeneity.

        <tr id="Tumors deficient in homologous recombination (HRD) predominantly rely on alternative DNA repair pathways for maintaining genome stability, especially once end resection has been initiated after a double strand break (DSB). These back up repair mechanisms, especially microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) and single-strand annealing (SSA), once considered minor contributors to genome stability, have garnered increased attention as recent evidence supports their significant roles in tumorigenesis and their potential as therapeutic targets. Consequently DNA polymerase theta (POLQ), a key regulator of MMEJ, emerges as an attractive target for the selective treatment of HRD cancers, and recent efforts in the development of POLQ inhibitors have demonstrated their potential to enhance the efficacy of existing therapies and overcome resistance mechanisms. In our study, we investigated the genetic drivers of the under-investigated SSA and its connection to the related MMEJ pathway in human cells. A previously unidentified role for POLQ in regulating the frequency of SSA was observed in addition to its role in MMEJ. Beyond its established role as a gap-filling polymerase, we show that the helicase activity of POLQ is critical for homology-mediated annealing in both MMEJ and SSA. POLQ is shown to be a key facilitator of SSA through its ability to process DNA ends and promote annealing of homologous sequences with at least 80% sequence identity (homeology), resulting in a range of deletion sizes. We also provide evidence for these homeology-dependent SSA-like repair scars in tumor genomes and show that they are associated with HRD and elevated POLQ expression, suggesting the utilization of these mechanisms as a critical repair pathway in these tumors. These findings suggest POLQ is the ideal target for therapies of HRD cancer.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most frequent lethal malignancy globally. It has been associated with limited treatment effectiveness in most cases, leading to modest clinical outcomes with first-line therapies. Despite the recent advancements in the treatment modalities, most patients fail to respond by switching to alternative bypass mechanisms and acquiring drug resistance. This emphasizes an urgent need to discover the underlying mechanistic circuitry in CRC pathogenesis and explore alternative robust drug targets to overcome the lack of treatment response thereby improving the patient's survival. In addition, molecular heterogeneity associated with tumor profiles also influences treatment outcomes, prompting a fundamental need for molecular characterization of colorectal tumors to design targeted therapies. Here, we used a bottom-up approach to delineate the clinical significance of Dyskerin pseudouridine synthase 1 (DKC1) in CRC patients. We observed elevated DKC1 levels in tumor specimens compared to adjacent normal tissue, associated with aggressive disease and poor recurrence-free survival. Moreover, patients acquiring resistance against standard treatment regimen (FOLFOX/FOFIRI) showed increased expression of DKC1. Importantly, loss-of-function studies suggest high DKC1 imparts oncogenicity by promoting cell cycle progression, suppressing cell death, and conferring stem cell-like phenotype. Notably, gene signature profile from DKC1-high patient tumors exhibit similarity to Consensus Molecular Subtype 2 (CMS2) of CRC. We deciphered a positive feedback loop operating between canonical WNT signaling and DKC1, responsible for orchestrating DKC1 expression and its associated tumorigenicity. Comprehensive lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal perturbed sphingolipid metabolism and an abundance of very-long-chain fatty acid ceramides, particularly Cer(d18:2/23:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:0) in DKC1-positive CRC. Mechanistically, Co-IP and ChIP-PCR results confirmed that DKC1 and SOX2 together drive the expression of SGPP2, modulating sphingolipid biosynthesis and targeting SGPP2 in DKC1-positive CRC alleviates oncogenic properties. Taken together, we demonstrate that elevated DKC1 expression imparts chemoresistance, and pharmacological inhibition of DKC1 and WNT signaling effectively attenuates the growth of therapy-resistant patient-derived organoids as well as CRC cells in a synergistic manner. Conclusively, we propose the DKC1/WNT axis as a promising therapeutic target for chemotherapy non-responding CRC patients. The study also highlights the utility of complex sphingolipids as a plasma-based biomarker providing a new paradigm for the non-invasive diagnosis of advanced-stage CRC patients.

        <tr id="Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, affects approximately 2-5% of individuals infected by the retrovirus Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus- 1 (HTLV-1). The disease has a dismal prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy is commonly seen in most patients. A significant characteristic of ATLL pathogenesis involves the disruption of normal epigenetic regulation, which results in transcriptional repression of tumour suppressors, mediated by the polycomb repressor complex 2 protein. Within this protein complex, the histone methyltransferases EZH1 and EZH2 play vital roles in catalyzing the excessive trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). In light of these mechanisms, a phase II clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of Valemetostat (VAL), a dual EZH1/2 inhibitor, in ATLL patients. Half of the patients responded to VAL; however, the median progression-free survival was only 7 months.To address these challenges and unbiasedly identify agents that could synergize with VAL, we conducted extensive high-throughput drug screens across four ATLL cell lines (ATL1K, ATL43T-, ATL55, and ED41214+). We initially screened 3,113 FDA-approved drugs to assess their pharmacological relevance in the presence of VAL. Additionally, given the important role of epigenetic deregulation in the pathogenesis of ATLL, we also tested 68 epigenetic chemical probes (ECPs) from the Structural Genomics Consortium with and without VAL. From these screens, we narrowed down the top 98 candidates from the FDA-approved drugs, based on the average cell viability minus two standard deviations, and the top five synergistically effective ECPs based on Bliss syngery score calculated by Synergy Finder across all four cell lines. We next screened these hits from FDA-approved drugs and the synergistically effective ECPs along with the corresponding negative non-functional probes across a wider ten-point dose range(2.5nM to 1uM for FDA-approved drugs and 10nM to 5uM for ECPs), both in the presence or absence of VAL. Based on the observed synergy, we identified our top nine hits that included bromodomain and methyltransferase inhibitors. Finally, we tested these nine hits in 6x6 combination matrices to precisely determine the optimal dosing with VAL.Currently, we are expanding our validation across additional ATLL cell lines and optimizing dosage schedules for in vivo testing on our established ATLL models to ensure synergistic effective.This research aims to identify novel targets that will sensitize resistant ATLL to epigenetic therapies. These findings may contribute to developing strategies to address drug resistance and offer additional treatment opportunities for this difficult-to-treat disease.

 Chemotherapy resistance remains a major challenge in clinical oncology. The mechanisms that regulate dynamic movement through adaptive cell states to survive through chemotherapeutic stress need to be understood to advance treatment options for patients and move towards curative therapies. In response to various stressors, cancer cells can reprogram their cell cycle, uncoupling DNA replication from mitotic division to acquire a large polyploid phenotype. This alternative cell cycle of repeated G and S phases is known as an endocycle, observed across the tree of life during both development and stress response. Cells exhibiting this phenotype exist in the transient endocycling cancer cell state. Endocycling cancer cells (ECCs) may serve as an actuator of chemotherapy resistance and disease recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms regulating the mitotic-to-endocycle switch and back are crucial to enhance treatments for patients with chemotherapy resistant cancer. A major driver of endocycling described in the literature is the transcription factor, c-Myc, due to its role in governing the G1/S transition. C-Myc is dysregulated in >70% of cancers, functioning as a critical cell cycle driver through transcriptional regulation of cyclins and CDKs, as well as essential metabolic programs necessary for cycle progression. Despite the published roles of Myc in both cancer and endocycling, we have shown through single cell RNA sequencing and western blotting that ECCs exhibit a low-Myc phenotype across multiple contexts. Myc protein levels can be rescued using the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, demonstrating that the low Myc status is driven by proteasomal degradation. To test if Myc degradation serves a mechanistic function, the small molecule inhibitor, MYCi975, was used to inhibit Myc activity at various points in the mitotic cell cycle. Our data shows that loss of Myc activity in cells beyond the restriction point induces mitotic bypass, generating a 4N G1 population. Notably, cells actively replicating their DNA in S phase show high sensitivity to Myc inhibition after skipping to G1, displaying cytotoxic effects not seen in other phases of the cell cycle. Similarly, when ECCs are challenged with the Myc inhibitor, the treatment promotes mitotic bypass and enriches for G0 and G1 populations, primed to enter the next S phase upon release from Myc inhibition. Together, these data suggest a temporal aspect of Myc regulation that has not been described in the literature. Myc activity beyond the restriction point appears to commit cells to mitotic entry, playing a functional role in coupling DNA replication to mitosis. This data supports our hypothesis that the low-Myc status of endocycling cells plays a mechanistic role in permitting mitotic bypass through premature loss of activity in G2. Preliminary data suggests that rescuing Myc activity will force mitotic entry producing mitotic progeny cells.

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive cancer subtype lacking targeted therapies, leaving chemotherapy as the primary treatment option. However, acquired resistance to drugs like paclitaxel (Taxol) poses a significant challenge, often driven by complex genetic and epigenetic changes. Our study identifies bromodomain and PHD finger-containing protein 1 (BRPF1) as a critical epigenetic regulator of Taxol resistance in TNBC cells, linking it to ribosome biogenesis and ABCB1-mediated drug resistance. We developed Taxol-resistant TNBC cell lines using an escalating dose protocol. These cells exhibited sustained resistance to high doses of Taxol, accompanied by significantly elevated expression of ABCB1. Epigenome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens revealed that BRPF1 is required for the survival of Taxol-resistant cells. Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of BRPF1 using small-molecule inhibitors sensitized resistant cells to Taxol. RNA sequencing and functional assays demonstrated that BRPF1 loss led to the downregulation of ribosomal biogenesis and translation-related genes, impairing global protein synthesis. Notably, BRPF1 was found to directly bind the ABCB1 promoter, regulating the elevated ABCB1 levels. These findings highlight BRPF1’s dual role in maintaining translation machinery integrity and modulating ABCB1-driven chemoresistance. In conclusion, our work identifies BRPF1 as a novel therapeutic target for combating Taxol resistance in TNBC. Targeting BRPF1 disrupts ribosome biogenesis and reverses ABCB1-mediated drug resistance, offering a promising strategy to overcome chemotherapy failure in aggressive breast cancers.

 ASXL1 is frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies, often causing a stabilization of ASXL1 and the polycomb-repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex, that results in a global reduction in H2AK119Ub and increased mRNA transcription. Poorer prognosis of AML with mutant (mt) ASXL1 creates an unmet need to identify and test novel therapies for this AML sub-type. We generated two knock-in (KI) models of the clinically relevant mtASXL1 Y591* into the AML cell lines OCI-AML3 and UCSD-AML1. Notably, ASXL1/BAP1 stabilization caused an increased expression of c-Myc at both the RNA and protein level. We observed via ChIP-Seq reduced H2AK119Ub at H3K27Ac-marked chromatin on Wnt/β-catenin stem cell pathway genes that resulted in increased mRNA expression of FZD5, TCF7L2, and WNT5A. KI of mtASXL1 in OCI-AML3 cells also increased G0/G1 with a concomitant reduction in S and G2/M phases of the cell-cycle. RNA-Seq analysis showed reduced expression of the REACTOME cell-cycle mitotic gene-set, associated with depletion of E2F1, AURKA/B, and PLK1 mRNA. A CRISPR screen in parental and KI cells revealed SPI1, CDK9, and EP300 among the top dependencies specific to mtASXL1 AML. Notably, compared to parental cells, OCIAML3 ASXL1 Y591* cells exhibited reduced sensitivity to standard anti-AML, chemotherapeutic agents, including cytarabine, etoposide and daunorubicin. Our findings confirm the previously published discovery that the presence of mtASXL1 confers an increased sensitivity to BETi inhibitors, e.g., pelabresib or birabresib. These cells were also more sensitive to other epigenetically targeted agents, including HATi (GNE-781 or CBP-IN-1), CDK8/19 mediator kinase inhibitor (SEL120-34A/RVU120) and the dual HAT/BETi (NEO2734/EP31670). Treatment with NEO2734 reduced the permissive chromatin marks especially on c-Myc and SPI1 super enhancers. There was also a significant reduction in mRNA and protein expressions of c-Myc, c-Myb, and PU.1. RNA-seq and mass-spectrometric analyses revealed that treatment with NEO2734 negatively enriched gene sets of c-Myc targets, rRNA processing, mRNA splicing, and translation. Treatment with SEL120 globally reduced active chromatin marks in the mtASXL1 expressing AML cells. This was associated with reduced protein expression of BAP1, pSTAT1 (S727), pSTAT5 (S726), MEIS1 and HOXA9, exclusively in mtASXL1 expressing cells. Co-treatment with pelabresib and NEO2734 or SEL120 and NEO2734 synergistically induced apoptosis in mtASXL1-expressing cells. Importantly, in the NSG mice engrafted with OCIAML3 ASXL1 Y591*, monotherapy with NEO2734, pelabresib or SEL120 significantly reduced AML burden. Collectively these findings highlight previously uncharacterized biologic effects of the presence of mtASXL1 and support the rationale for further evaluating AML therapies incorporating BETi, HAT-BETi or mediator-kinase inhibitor.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors are cancer therapeutics that have shown remarkable success in extending lives in many cancers, including melanoma, MSI-high cancers, and other cancers. However, these therapeutics have not shown benefit for many patients with cancer, especially those with advanced cancer diagnoses. In addition, many patients develop resistance to these therapeutics and/or life-altering adverse events that can include cardiotoxicity, pneumonitis, thyroiditis, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. Extensive efforts to improve cancer care by uncovering mechanisms of resistance to immune therapy in solid tumors have led to identification of new sources of resistance and to the development of new approaches to activate or sustain antitumor immunity. Chronic stimulation of T cells by tumors and by checkpoint inhibitors can lead to a progressive state of T-cell exhaustion. Chronic T-cell activation by the tumor microenvironment (TME) or immune therapeutics can upregulate the expression and function of alternate checkpoints, including the T-cell protein LAG-3. Persistent interferon signaling in the TME can drive epigenetic changes in cancer cells that enable tumors to counter immune activation and disrupt tumor cell elimination. In addition, immune-suppressive macrophages can flood tumors in response to signals from dying tumor cells, further preventing effective immune responses. New clinical developments and/or approvals for therapies that target alternate immune checkpoints, such as the T-cell checkpoint LAG-3; myeloid cell proteins, such as the kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma isoform; and chronic interferon signaling, such as Jak 1 inhibitors, have been approved for cancer care or shown promise in recent clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Background Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is the most frequently occurring type of colon cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are pivotal in facilitating tumor growth and metastasis; however, their specific role in COAD is not yet fully understood. This research utilizes single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify and validate gene markers linked to the malignancy of CAFs. Methods ScRNA-seq data was downloaded from a database and subjected to quality control, dimensionality reduction, clustering, cell annotation, cell communication analysis, and enrichment analysis, specifically focusing on fibroblasts in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. Fibroblast subsets were isolated, dimensionally reduced, and clustered, then combined with copy number variation (CNV) inference and pseudotime trajectory analysis to identify genes related to malignancy. A Cox regression model was constructed based on these genes, incorporating LASSO analysis, nomogram construction, and validation.Subsequently, we established two FNDC5-knockdown cell lines and utilized colony formation and transwell assays to investigate the impact of FNDC5 on cellular biological behaviors. Results Using scRNA-seq data, we analyzed 8,911 cells from normal and tumor samples, identifying six distinct cell types. Cell communication analysis highlighted interactions between these cell types mediated by ligands and receptors. CNV analysis classified CAFs into three groups based on malignancy levels. Pseudo-time analysis identified 622 pseudotime-related genes and generated a forest plot using univariate Cox regression. Lasso regression identified the independent prognostic gene FNDC5, which was visualized in a nomogram. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed the prognostic value of FNDC5, showing associations with T stage and distant metastasis. In vitro experiment results demonstrated a strong association between FNDC5 expression levels and the proliferative, migratory, and invasive abilities of colon cancer cells. Conclusion We developed a risk model for genes related to the malignancy of CAFs and identified FNDC5 as a potential therapeutic target for COAD.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous hematological malignancy characterized by diverse genetic and epigenetic aberrations, making therapeutic interventions particularly challenging. We have identified a novel combination therapy that leverages differences in cell cycle dynamics to induce AML cell differentiation, and found AML cells which were highly sensitive to inhibitors of the histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1A depending on their cell cycle profile. Here, we aim at identifying other potential epigenetic vulnerabilities of AML cell lines exposed to the treatment with different CDK inhibitors. Given the heterogeneity of the epigenetic aberrations found in AML, targeting additional chromatin regulators could improve the clinical applicability of this combination therapy. Thus, we started an in vitro CRISPR-screening approach, targeting over 600 chromatin-related genes. Following optimization of Cas9-expressing clones and evaluation of knockout (KO) efficiency, we confirmed that the best-performing clone retained phenotypic consistency with parental cells under combination therapy. Preliminary data validated the effectiveness of our screening platform, as sgRNAs targeting LSD1 recapitulated the phenotype observed with CDK inhibitors treatment, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. In parallel, we investigated the molecular link between cell cycle manipulation and chromatin remodeling. We conducted a nuclear phospho-proteomics experiment on cells treated with CDK inhibitors. This analysis identified differential phosphorylation of several proteins, which are currently under investigation. Additionally, gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment in pathways regulating RNA metabolism, transcription, and DNA damage response. By integrating cell cycle modulation with epigenetic targeting, our work offers new insights into AML differentiation therapy, with the potential to improve therapeutic outcomes in diverse AML subtypes.

 Drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells that survive initial anticancer drug treatment despite lacking genetic resistance-driving alterations. DTPs have been shown to serve as an intermediate stage in the evolution of acquired drug resistance, facilitating the adaptation and survival of cancer cells under sustained therapeutic pressure. Recent studies have shed light on the biological characteristics of DTPs during and following drug treatment, describing the various adaptations that cells undergo while transforming into a DTP state. However, little is known about the biology of persistence potential — the cellular and molecular characteristics that prime certain drug-naïve cells to survive initial drug exposure. The main challenge in studying the persistence potential of drug-naïve cells lies in the need to treat cells to determine whether they will persist. To address this issue, we demonstrated the hereditary nature of persistence potential and adopted a high-resolution lineage tracing technology, to develop an assay for the study of persistence potential. This method, utilizing CRISPR-targeted evolving barcodes to reconstruct a lineage tree from a single-cell-derived clone, allows for the placement of persister cells along drug-naïve cells on the lineage tree. Utilizing this technology to study persistence to EGFR inhibitors in EGFR-positive non-small-cell lung cancer cells, we identified events on the lineage tree that alter the persistence potential of specific clades and derived the persistence potential of drug-naïve cells. Combining single-cell RNAseq data with cell persistence potential, we developed a computational pipeline to study the molecular mechanisms that govern the probability of drug-naïve cells to persist through drug treatment. We demonstrated that upregulation of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation correlates with a significant increase in persistence potential. These results agree with previous studies that demonstrate that cells in the DTP state are less dependent on glycolysis and rely more on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production and suggests that drug-naïve cells with elevated persistence potential are primed towards a high oxidative phosphorylation state. Intriguingly, we also described a module of translation-related genes that are negatively correlated with persistence potential, in agreement with recent results that show that persister cells undergo reversible remodeling of mRNA translation. This work introduces a novel approach and computational framework to study persistence potential and allows for the identification of potential drivers of persistence. A better understanding of the unique cellular and molecular traits that drive persistence potential is crucial for the study of drug persistence and development of targeted therapies preventing persistence and enhancing the likelihood of curative treatment.

 The development of treatment resistance remains universal for metastatic prostate cancer patients, driven by AR alterations and lineage state transitions. Identifying the evolution of molecular alterations during treatment has been limited by the challenges of serial tumor biopsies, which can be overcome by blood-based liquid biopsies. However, standard cell-free DNA approaches cannot directly assess changes in gene expression, crucial to understanding resistance.



 We developed a novel circulating tumor cell (CTC) isolation approach with purity comparable to tissue biopsies and performed CTC RNA sequencing of 273 blood samples from a prospective multi-institutional cohort of 117 metastatic prostate cancer patients. We examined prostate cancer lineage states associated with prognosis and response to 177Lu-PSMA-617 in men with metastatic prostate cancer.



 Single sample pathway analysis of high CTC purity samples identified four transcriptional phenotypes: luminal A-like (LumA), luminal B-like (LumB), low proliferation (LP), and neuroendocrine (NE). Compared to patients with low CTC burden/purity (median OS not reached), patients with LumA and LP phenotypes showed similar survival, while patients with LumB and NE CTC phenotypes had shorter survival (LumB: median OS 6m, HR 9.1[3.8-21.8], p<0.0001, NE: median OS 3.7m, HR 11.8[2.4-57.2], p=0.0019). We isolated CTCs longitudinally from 37 patients receiving 177Lu-PSMA-617. LumA/LP/Low burden samples had significantly greater benefit from ARPIs compared to LumB and NEPC, as hypothesized. Pretreatment LumA/LP/Low burden CTC phenotypes had a significantly higher clinical benefit rate with 177Lu-PSMA-617 than the LumB phenotype (64% vs 14%, Fisher’s Exact p=0.033), which was associated with early progression on 177Lu-PSMA-617 (Fisher’s Exact p=0.038).



 We report the largest CTC RNA-seq cohort of patients with metastatic prostate cancer and demonstrate that high-purity CTC RNA-seq identifies prostate cancer lineage states mirroring those in tissue, including an NE phenotype concordant with small cell/neuroendocrine histology. We also identified a more common LumB phenotype defined by persistent AR signaling and high proliferation and associated with poor prognosis and poor response to 177Lu-PSMA-617.

        <tr id="Recent approvals of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) for BRCA-mutant metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) necessitate an understanding of the factors that shape sensitivity and resistance. Reversion mutations that restore homologous recombination (HR) repair are detected in ∼50-80% of BRCA-mutant patients who respond but subsequently relapse, but there is currently little insight into why only ∼50% of BRCA-mutant patients display upfront resistance. To address this question, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genomic determinants of PARPi resistance in murine Brca2Δ/Δ prostate organoids genetically engineered in a manner that precludes the development of reversion mutations. Remarkably, we recovered multiple independent sgRNAs targeting three different members (Cdt1, Cdc6, Dbf4) of the DNA pre-replication complex (pre-RC), each of which independently conferred resistance to olaparib and the next generation PARP-1 selective inhibitor AZD5305. Moreover, sensitivity to PARP inhibition was restored in Brca2Δ/Δ, Cdc6-depleted prostate cells by knockdown of geminin, a negative regulator of Cdt1, further implicating the critical role of a functional pre-RC complex in PARPi sensitivity. Furthermore, ∼50% of CRPC tumors have copy number loss of pre-RC complex genes, particularly CDT1. Mechanistically, prostate cells with impaired pre-RC activity displayed rapid resolution of olaparib-induced DNA damage as well as protection from replication fork degradation caused by Brca2 loss, providing insight into how Brca2-mutant cancer cells can escape cell death from replication stress induced by PARP inhibition in the absence of HR repair. Of note, a pharmacologic inhibitor that targets the CDT1/geminin complex (AF615) restored sensitivity to AZD5305, providing a potential translational avenue to enhance sensitivity to PARP inhibition in BRCA-mutant cancers. Significance Here, we address a major limitation in the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutant prostate cancer treatment: only ∼50% of patients respond despite clear genomic evidence of defective homologous recombination. Prior efforts to study PARP inhibitor resistance in prostate cancer have been plagued by the lack of suitable cell lines. We overcame this challenge using primary prostate organoids coupled with genome-wide CRISPR screening. The key finding is that loss of function mutations in the DNA pre-replication complex confer PARP inhibitor resistance. These genes map to chromosomal regions frequently lost in prostate cancer and could therefore serve as potential biomarkers of treatment response. Pharmacologic inhibition of geminin, a negative regulator of the pre-replication complex, can restore PARP inhibitor sensitivity.">

        <tr id="CRISPR–Cas9 is a powerful genome-editing technology that can precisely target and cleave DNA to induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) at almost any genomic locus. While this versatility holds tremendous therapeutic potential, the predominant cellular pathway for DSB repair—non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)—often introduces small insertions or deletions that disrupt the target site. In contrast, homology-directed repair (HDR) utilizes exogenous donor templates to enable precise gene modifications, including targeted insertions, deletions, and substitutions. However, HDR remains relatively inefficient compared to NHEJ, especially in postmitotic cells where cell cycle constraints further limit HDR. To address this challenge, numerous methodologies have been explored, ranging from inhibiting key NHEJ factors and optimizing donor templates to synchronizing cells in HDR-permissive phases and engineering HDR-enhancing fusion proteins. These strategies collectively aim to boost HDR efficiency and expand the clinical and research utility of CRISPR–Cas9. In this review, we discuss recent advances in manipulating the balance between NHEJ and HDR, examine the trade-offs and practical considerations of these approaches, and highlight promising directions for achieving high-fidelity genome editing in diverse cell types.">

Although these DNA repair-deficient tumors are eligible for effective targeted therapies, fully reliable diagnostic strategies based on functional assay have yet to be established, potentially limiting safe and proper application of the molecular targeted drugs. Here we show that transient transfection of artificial DNA substrates enables ultrarapid detection of HR and MMR. This finding led us to develop a diagnostic strategy that can determine the cellular HR/MMR status within one day without the need for control cells or tissues. Notably, the accuracy of this method allowed the discovery of a pathogenic RAD51D mutation, which was missed by existing companion diagnostic tests. Our methods, termed HR eye and MMR eye, are applicable to frozen tumor tissues and roughly predict the response to therapy.

 Patient derived xenografts (PDX) are important preclinical models of cancer as they faithfully recapitulate many aspects of human tumors. Currently, models derived from patients of non-European genetic ancestry are underrepresented, limiting the potential of precision medicine advancements to equitably improve patient outcomes. The United for Health Equity Living PDX Program (U4HELPP) seeks to address this need by generating new PDX models representative of the diverse population served by the VCU Health System. This study aims to 1) characterize the histologic, genomic, and transcriptomic features of a new cohort of ancestrally diverse PDX models of breast, pancreatic, colon, and lung cancer, and 2) identify drug sensitivities and response markers that will be targeted in ongoing studies utilizing these models.



 Tumor fragments were implanted in the bilateral mammary glands or subcutaneous flank of NSG mice, and growth rates were defined. Tissue was fixed and embedded for histological staining to identify the cancer type and subtype. Whole genome and bulk RNA sequencing were performed to assess the mutational profile, genetic ancestry, and global transcriptomic landscape. Single cell RNA sequencing was utilized to capture the transcriptomic heterogeneity within each model. Finally, high throughput drug screening with the NCI NExT Oncology Interrogation Tools Set of 555 agents was performed in vitro to assess the drug sensitivities of each PDX.



 Whole genome sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing positively identified distinct genetic ancestries within the cohort. Histopathologic analysis revealed a rare metaplastic breast carcinoma, and immunohistochemical staining stratified breast cancer models into estrogen receptor positive and triple negative subtypes. Bulk RNA sequencing was used to subtype pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models as basal-like, classical, or intermediate, and single-cell RNA sequencing confirmed the presence of mixed subtype populations within these samples. High throughput drug screening identified sensitivities that correlated with mutations detected through whole genome sequencing; overall, several classes of drugs including proteasome and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors were found to be highly cytotoxic in all cancer types tested.



 This study integrates multiple modalities to characterize the histological features, molecular signatures, and cellular heterogeneity of this new cohort of PDXs, which will provide researchers with extensive data on which to base future studies utilizing these models. Furthermore, it identifies promising therapeutic agents and explores genomic markers of drug sensitivity which could be used to predict patient response to novel treatments.

 p53 and Rb co-mutations are common in several human cancers and are associated with the onset of aggressive tumors with complex karyotypes. Canonically, these tumor suppressors respond to DNA damage and cellular stress by inducing cell cycle arrest, activating pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative signalling, and promoting cellular senescence. While these pathways are sufficient to partially explain the tumor suppressive abilities of p53 and Rb, recent studies in genetically engineered mouse models suggest additional, non-canonical means of tumor suppression, including modulation of cellular differentiation and DNA topology, and interestingly, influencing cellular response to chromosomal instability. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of aggressive, therapy-resistant cancers and is associated with mitotic dysfunction, faulty DNA damage responses, immune evasion, and cellular stress response pathways. While it is known that p53 and Rb maintain the integrity of the genomic landscape, the mechanisms by which they prevent CIN remain understudied. Here, we use mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to show that p53 + Rb double knock-out (DKO) causes a dramatic increase in ploidy at very early passages, which stabilizes at tetraploid levels. These cells also harbour high levels of CIN, indicated by the presence of micronuclei, DNA double-stranded breaks, and lagging chromosomes. Additionally, we observed CIN in p5325, 26 transactivation domain (TAD) mutant MEFs that are unable to activate most canonical p53 targets yet retain the ability to suppress tumorigenesis in vivo, raising the possibility that the maintenance of chromosomal stability is dispensable to the tumor suppressive functions of p53. Using a combination of bulk and scRNA sequencing of aneuploid and diploid DKO MEFs, in future experiments we will identify p53- and Rb-dependent changes in gene expression associated with the onset and progression of CIN. Overall, the results of this study are expected to provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms by which tumor suppressors p53 and Rb work together to repress CIN.

        <tr id="Metabolites are essential substrates for epigenetic modifications. Although nuclear acetyl-CoA constitutes a small fraction of the whole cell pool, it regulates cell fate by locally providing histone acetylation substrate. Here, we combined phenotypic chemical screen and genome-wide CRISPR screen to demonstrate a nucleus-specific acetyl-CoA regulatory mechanism that can be modulated to achieve therapeutic cancer cell reprogramming. While previously thought that nucleus-localized pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (nPDC) is constitutively active, we found that nPDC is constitutively inhibited by the nuclear protein ELMSAN1 through direct interaction. Pharmacologic inhibition of the ELMSAN1-nPDC interaction derepressed nPDC activity, enhancing nuclear acetyl-CoA generation and reprogramming cancer cells to a postmitotic state with diminished cell-of-origin signatures. Reprogramming was synergistically enhanced by histone deacetylase 1/2 inhibition, resulting in inhibited tumor growth, durably suppressed tumor-initiating ability, and improved survival in multiple cancer types in vivo, including therapy-resistant sarcoma patient-derived xenografts and carcinoma cell line xenografts. Our findings highlight the potential of targeting ELMSAN1-nPDC as epigenetic cancer therapy.">

 Background:
 Pancreatic cancer has apoor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. While
 K-RAS
 mutations are prevalent in this malignancy, a subset of patients harboring wild-type
 K-RAS
 presents distinct clinical behavior. Gene fusions have been discerned in pancreatic cancer and are promising candidates for administering targeted therapies.
 Methods:
 We conducted a retrospective analysis of 926 pancreatic cancer patients of which 165 (18%) carried a wild-type
 K-RAS
 gene, by next generation sequencing (NGS) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Tumors were analyzed with a clinical-grade hybrid capture-based RNA-seq clinical fusionome test, evaluating gene fusions between 1104 genes or to other known or novel partners as well as gene expression transcript analysis. Single nucleotide variants/insertions deletions (SNV/Indels) were tested with a clinical-grade NGS assay targeting > 300 cancer genes.
 Results:
 Gene fusions were detected in 32% of
 K-RAS
 wild-type pancreatic cancers, with 75% involving known oncogenic, clinically actionable genes including
 FGFR
 (two
 FGFR2
 and one
 FGFR1
 fusion), two
 NTRK3
 and one each of
 RAF1, RET, ROS1
 and
 BRAF
 fusions. Deleterious SNVs were frequently found in both fusion-positive and fusion-negative
 K-RAS
 wild-type pancreatic cancers. Transcriptomic expression revealed additional potentially druggable targets, e.g.,
 ROS1
 and
 FGFR3
 overexpression in a tumor harboring an
 NTRK3
 fusion,
 BRAF
 overexpression in the context of an otherwise non-actionable
 ETV6
 fusion, and
 MET
 overexpression in a
 TES::TFEC
 -fusion bearing cancer.
 Conclusions:
 Druggable fusions are frequent in
 K-RAS
 wild-type pancreatic cancers. Moreover, RNA fusion assays as well as transcriptomic expression testing can identify candidate personalized therapies for patients with
 K-RAS
 wild-type pancreatic cancer.

 Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is treated with a combination of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation but is unfortunately still associated with poor cancer survival. Improving radiation efficacy is essential to enhance tumor control and reduce resistance, ultimately improving outcomes for patients. Metabolic reprogramming could play a key role in this by targeting cancer cell metabolism to increase sensitivity to radiation and reduce tumor growth. S6K1 has emerged as a metabolic regulator that promotes chemo and radio-resistance in several cancers. However, the associated mechanisms to this phenomenon are unclear. We sought to determine if pharmacological or metabolic inhibition of S6K1 modulates radioresistance in lung cancer.
 Methods/Results: The intrinsic radiosensitivity of cells lines originating from NSCLC was determined by clonogenic and proliferation assays. Four cancer cell lines of varying intrinsic radiation sensitivity were chosen as a model to investigate the role of S6K1. The A549 cells were the most resistant followed by H661, H226 and the most sensitive as H23. The phospho-activation of S6K1 and its downstream target S6 increased in more resistant cells, associating S6K1 activation with radioresistance. TCGA analysis showed that S6K1 is overexpressed in lung cancer patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.001). Inhibition of S6K1 by pharmacologic means using a highly specific inhibitor (PF-4708671), or by genetic deletion of S6K1 by Crispr-Cas9, in combination with radiation, significantly decreased the colony formation compared with controls. Using in vivo murine models, S6K1-/- tumors had notably decreased tumor progression than the S6K1+/+ tumors (p<0.001). To determine the role of metabolic reprogramming on S6K1 activation and its effects on radioresistance, in vitro models of caloric restriction were tested and demonstrated a decreased S6K1 activation, and radiosensitivity trough reduction of transcriptional activation of STAT3, a target involved in radio-resistance. In NSCLC murine models, caloric restriction significatively decreased the tumor burden in mice.



 Our findings demonstrate that targeting S6K1, through pharmacological inhibition or metabolic interventions like caloric restriction, significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy in NSCLC. Studies are underway to elucidate the detailed mechanisms linking S6K1 activity and caloric restriction to radiosensitivity, with the potential to inform novel therapeutic strategies for improving outcomes in lung cancer patients.

 Background:
 Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most common malignancy in young adult men, with a globally increasing incidence. While these tumors are highly curable due to their exceptional sensitivity to cisplatin (cDDP), a proportion of patients develops a resistance to this chemotherapy, which results in disease progression and patient death. The cause of cisplatin resistance in TGCT has not been elucidated yet and is supposed to be multifactorial.
 Methods:
 We conducted a CRISPR Knockout (KO) screening in a TGCT cell line (NCCIT) using a lentiviral sgRNAs library (Addgene #101926) targeting 3015 genes involved in cell cycle regulation and cancer development. The screening population was cultured with or without cDDP (1.25 uM) for 7 days. Samples of treated and control cells were harvested before and after cDDP exposure, the sgRNA cassettes were sequenced by massive parallel sequencing, and the differences in sgRNA abundance were determined using the MAGeCK/MAGeCK-Flute pipeline.
 Results:
 The CRISPR-KO screening data analysis identified 59 gene KOs that were significantly positively selected and 7 gene KOs that were significantly negatively selected after cDDP exposure. Among the top positive hits were genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis (
 BMF, CDIP1
 and
 BAX
 ), epigenetic modifiers (
 HDAC8, SSX2
 ), G-protein regulators (
 ADCY8, GNG10
 ), and others (e.g.
 MAGEA2, ACADM, LAMP1
 ) — inactivation of these genes potentially contributes to the development of cDDP resistance. Among the top negative hits were genes implicated in DNA damage repair (
 FANCB
 ,
 ERCC5
 ), sphingolipid metabolism (
 KDSR
 ), and cytokinesis (
 SPECC1L
 ) — inactivation of these genes may increase sensitivity to cDDP.
 Conclusions:
 The results highlight several potential mechanisms of cDPP resistance in TGCT. Some of these genes and pathways are well known and have been previously described in association with platinum resistance in malignant tumors, while others — such as the G-protein regulators, sphingolipid synthesis, and
 SPECC1L
 — are novel in this context and may reflect the unique biology of TGCT progression. SPECC1L is involved in spindle organization and microtubule stabilization; its paralog SPECC1 is highly expressed in testis. Polyenoic sphingolipids are essential for the completion of meiosis in male germ cells and spermatozoa production.

 ADCY8 controls the production of cAMP, which is a key signaling molecule in spermatogenesis. They have also been described in association with malignant proliferation and progression. The identified hits will be validated in subsequent experiments.

        <tr id="Oncogenic gene fusions occur across a broad range of cancers and are a defining feature of some cancer types. Cancers driven by gene fusion products tend to respond well to targeted therapies, where available; thus, detection of potentially targetable oncogenic fusions is necessary to select optimal treatment. Detection methods include non-sequencing methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, and sequencing methods, such as DNA- and RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS). While NGS is an efficient way to analyze multiple genes of interest at once, economic and technical factors may preclude its use in routine care globally, despite several guideline recommendations. The aim of this review is to present a summary of oncogenic gene fusions, with a focus on fusions that affect tyrosine kinase signaling, and to highlight the importance of testing for oncogenic fusions. We present an overview of the identification of oncogenic gene fusions and therapies approved for the treatment of cancers harboring gene fusions, and summarize data regarding treating fusion-positive cancers with no current targeted therapies and clinical studies of fusion-positive cancers. Although treatment options may be limited for patients with rare alterations, healthcare professionals should identify patients most likely to benefit from oncogenic gene fusion testing and initiate the appropriate targeted therapy to achieve optimal treatment outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly aggressive cancer with a 5-year survival rate of less than 35%. It is characterized by significant drug resistance and abnormal energy metabolism. Mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism are crucial for AML cell survival. Mitochondrial fusion protein optic atrophy (OPA)1 is upregulated in AML patients with adverse mutations and correlates with poor prognosis. Method This study investigated targeting OPA1 with TMQ0153, a tetrahydrobenzimidazole derivative, to disrupt mitochondrial metabolism and dynamics as a novel therapeutic approach to overcome treatment resistance. Effects of TMQ0153 treatment on OPA1 and mitofusin (MFN)2 protein levels, mitochondrial morphology, and function in AML cells. In this study, we examined reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibition, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, and apoptosis. Additionally, metabolic profiling was conducted to analyze changes in metabolic pathways. Results TMQ0153 treatment significantly reduced OPA1 and mitofusin (MFN)2 protein levels and disrupted the mitochondrial morphology and function in AML cells. This increases ROS production and inhibits OXPHOS, MMP depolarization, and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Metabolic reprogramming was observed, shifting from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis and impaired respiratory chain activity. Profiling revealed reduced overall metabolism along with changes in the glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and NAD⁺/NADH redox ratios. TMQ0153 treatment reduces tumor volume and weight in MV4-11 xenografts in vivo. Combination therapies with TMQ0153 and other AML drugs significantly reduced the leukemic burden and prolonged survival in NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice xenografted with U937-luc and MOLM-14-luc cells. Conclusion TMQ0153 targets mitochondrial dynamics by inhibiting OPA1, inducing metabolic reprogramming, and triggering apoptosis in AML cells. It enhances the efficacy of existing AML therapies and provides a promising combination treatment approach that exploits mitochondrial vulnerability and metabolic reprogramming to improve treatment outcomes in AML.

        <tr id="Lynch syndrome (LS), also known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is caused by monoallelic germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (e.g., MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2), which predispose individuals to an increased risk of developing various cancers (mainly colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer). The hallmark of LS-associated tumors is high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) characterized by increased mutations at coding mononucleotide repeats (cMNR), which usually lead to frameshift mutations (FSMs) in coding exons. These recurrent FSMs are thought to play a central role in the increased cancer risk. Vaccines targeting neoantigens produced by FSMs can elicit immune responses, which may prevent or suppress LS tumor formation and progression. Indeed, frameshift neoantigen-based vaccines have been developed and are being tested in LS or MSI-H patients in clinical trials (e.g., NOUS-209). To accelerate vaccine development and optimization, we have developed and characterized an intra-cecal tumor implantation model using tumor fragments derived from a LS mouse model (Msh2LoxP/LoxP;Villin-Cre; VCMsh2). The model was examined for its suitability for preclinical vaccine evaluation in prevention (vaccination followed by fragment implantation) and treatment (fragment implantation followed by vaccination) settings. Primary cecal tumors were adenocarcinoma mixed with mucinous feature. In contrast to subcutaneous tumor implant models that never develop metastasis, metastatic lesions were detected in the lung, liver, and lymph nodes within two months post intra-cecal tumor implantation. In both settings, vaccinated animals had intra-cecal tumors that were smaller in size and a lower rate of metastasis and lower number of metastatic nodules as compared to unvaccinated controls (2 vs. 13 nodules in preventive setting and 1 vs. 4 nodules in therapeutic setting, respectively). FSM analysis by targeted next generation sequencing of a panel of 50 genes revealed that some loci had lower mutation rates and variant allele frequencies, but not at all vaccine targets, in tumors from vaccinated groups compared to controls, indicating that tumor cells harboring certain FSMs targeted by the vaccine were not eliminated. Vaccine target composition and formulation need to be further optimized. Interestingly, plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA) showed lower FSM rates in vaccinated groups, which correlated with a lower metastatic rate. This is consistent with data from VCMsh2 model vaccinated with frameshift peptide vaccines. Additional studies are needed to confirm whether this is neoantigen vaccine specific. In summary, this intra-cecal implantation LS model appears suitable for preclinical neoantigen-based vaccine testing and may help elucidate aspects of tumor cell/DNA shedding and distant metastasis.

        <tr id="Simple Summary The presence of certain DNA damage/repair errors together can cause cancer cells to die, offering hope for new treatments. Mutational signatures show how DNA damage/repair errors happened by looking at the types and amounts of mutations. We studied mutational signatures that occur together or separately, called mutational signature interactions, to find which combinations of DNA repair errors help cancer cells thrive and which ones harm them. We analyzed mutational signatures and their interactions in 1014 breast cancer genomes. HRd and NHEJd were found together with APOBEC, while they did not overlap with the ROS mutational signature. Mutational signature interactions were distinct in various breast cancer types. Non-HRd TNBC tumors showed a unique ROS signature, while HRd TNBC tumors did not have an ROS signature. These analyses show that mutational signatures and their interactions could help identify promising synthetic lethal targets in DNA repair systems, improve how patients are grouped and point to potential treatments. Abstract Background: Defective DNA repair systems result in the accumulation of mutations, loss of genomic integrity, and eventually cancer. Following initial malignant transformation due to specific DNA damage and defective DNA repair, cancer cells become reliant upon other DNA repair pathways for their survival. The co-occurrence of specific repair deficiencies brings catastrophic outcomes such as cell death for cancer cells and thus holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy. Exploring the co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity of mutational signatures provides valuable knowledge regarding combinations of defective repair pathways that are cooperative and confer selective advantage to cancer cells and those that are detrimental and cannot be tolerated by them. Methods: Taking advantage of mutational signature profiling, we analyzed whole-genome sequences of 1014 breast cancers to reveal the underlying mutational processes and their interrelationships. Results: We found an inverse relationship between deficiencies of homologous recombination (HRd) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJd) with reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, HRd and NHEJd co-occurred with APOBEC but were mutually exclusive with mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) and ROS. Our analysis revealed that SBS8 and SBS39 signatures of currently unknown etiology correlate with NHEJd. ID1 and ID2 signatures co-occur with ROS and have mutual exclusivity with HRd, SBS8, SBS39 and NHEJd. The ID4 signature, with currently unknown etiology, has mutual exclusivity with HRd and NHEJd and co-occurred with ROS. On the other hand, the ID15 signature, with currently unknown etiology, co-occurred with SBS8, SBS39, HRd, NHEJd and DBS2, while having an inverse relationship with MMRd and ROS. Comparing the mutational signatures of HRd and non-HRd TNBC genomes reveals the unique presence of ROS signatures in non-HRd tumors and the lack of ROS signature in HRd tumors. Conclusion: Taken together, these analyses indicate the possible application of mutation signatures and their interactions in advancing patient stratification and suggest appropriate therapies targeting the make-up of individual tumors’ mutational processes. Ultimately, this information provides the opportunity to discover promising synthetic lethal candidates targeting DNA repair systems.">

 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive tumor with poor prognosis. The standard-of-care treatment (chemotherapy +/- radiation) has seen little advancement over three decades, apart from the addition of immunotherapy for extensive-stage patients. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have emerged as a promising therapeutic option in SCLC; however, their clinical application remains challenging due to variable patient responses. The biological determinants of PARPi response in SCLC are not fully understood. This study aims to identify novel biological factors that predict PARPi response in SCLC.



 A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) screen was conducted in the SBC-5 SCLC cell line using the Toronto Knockout v1 (TKOv1) library with PARPi olaparib (5 µM) as the selection pressure. Cells were collected on days 25 and 35 for genomic sequencing to determine sgRNA enrichment. Isogenic FBXO11 and LacZ (negative control) KO cell lines were generated, and cell viability was assessed after 7-day PARPi (olaparib, talazoparib) treatment. Immunofluorescence staining of γH2AX foci was performed in isogenic FBXO11 KO SBC-5 cells after 24hr talazoparib (100 nM) treatment. Proximity-dependent biotin labeling combined with LC-MS protein identification (BioID) was performed in FlpIn HEK293 cells expressing BirA*-FBXO11 fusion protein. KEGG pathway analysis of putative interactors was performed to examine enrichment of relevant biological pathways. Protein-protein interaction was assessed using proximity ligation assays (PLA). LC-MS-based global proteomic profiling was conducted in isogenic FBXO11 KO SBC-5 cells (+/- olaparib), and gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed to identify differentially regulated pathways.



 The genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 KO screen revealed that FBXO11 loss provides a survival advantage under stringent PARPi selection. FBXO11 KO resulted in a 2- to 20-fold increase in the IC50 of olaparib and talazoparib in three SCLC cell lines (NCI-H196, SBC-5, NCI-H69). FBXO11 KO cells exhibited fewer γH2AX foci after PARPi treatment compared to LacZ KO (p < 0.0001). BioID of FBXO11 identified putative protein interactors from a pre-mRNA splicing complex (XAB2, ISY1, AQR). PLA showed a significantly reduced interaction between XAB2 and AQR in FBXO11 KO cells (p < 0.0001), suggesting that FBXO11 affects pre-mRNA splicing complex formation. GO analysis of global proteomics showed an upregulation of pathways involved in apoptosis, mRNA splicing, and spliceosomal complex assembly after olaparib treatment exclusively in LacZ KO cells, but not FBXO11 KO cells, which may explain the differential response to PARPi.



 We identified a novel gene, FBXO11, whose loss results in PARPi resistance in SCLC cell lines. BioID of FBXO11 and global proteomic profiling suggests that pre-mRNA splicing may play a role in mediating drug resistance.

 Background:
 Adjuvant Therapy (AT) is recommended in colon cancer (CC) to enhance surgical cures, by few percentages, typically in node positive stages. Many patients don’t derive benefits from AT but are difficult to identify currently. Ten-year data from the MOSAIC study indicates that AT’s impact on recurrence is limited to 30 months post-surgery. This timeframe aligns with the predicted period between stem cell activation and clinical recurrence. Chemotherapy, therefore, primarily targets the proliferative progenitors facilitating the innate immune effectors (e.g. NK cells) interception of recurrence events (optimizing the ratio). By identifying proliferative capacities through DNA findings could optimize patient selection. We hypothesized that an intrinsic DNA events drive early recurrence and denote AT beneficiaries. To test this hypothesis, we focused on a set of genes relevant to the cell cycle and report on copy number alterations (CNA).
 Methods:
 Patients in stages 2 and 3 CC in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) were categorized into those who recurred within the first 30 months (R); or the remaining population (N). Cyclins and Cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) would be relevant if amplified in R and cell cycle inhibitors would be relevant if amplified in N. Here we report on gene amplification of E2F1, RB, p21, CDKs, CCNE1, CCNB1 CCNA1, MCM2, MCM5, MCM7, and RFC2.
 Results:
 Cyclins E, A and B are amplified in R substantially more than in N (17% v 2%; 11% v 0% and 6% v 3%, respectively). Similarly, p21 is amplified in 6% in N v 0% in R. E3F amplification is similar in both R and N groups and RB is amplified, paradoxically, in the R (28%) v 9% in N.
 Conclusions:
 The findings highlight the potential role of intrinsic DNA events mediating proliferation in predicting recurrence following surgery in a time frame that is relevant to AT. Identifying such markers may enhance patient selection and reduce unnecessary toxicity from ineffective treatments. Relevant DNA events are certainly not limited to CNAs studied in this work and need to expand to include relevant mutational and rearrangement events (gain- or loss of function, based on the physiologic roles). Given the stability of DNA confirmation of these findings is feasible even in archival material. Moreover, unsupervised analysis of the mediators of recurrence in relevant postoperative times is valid and promising. Further studies with independent larger datasets are needed to validate these observations.

 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) improve survival in patients with metastatic urothelial cancers (mUC) but most patients experience disease progression. The mechanisms driving this progression are mostly unknown. We longitudinally assessed mUC microenvironment at the single-cell level in ICI-treated patients to explore the determinants of the response and adaptive resistance mechanisms on therapy.



 The prospective MATCH-R study (NCT02517892) included patients with mUC treated with single-agent PD-(L)1 inhibitors. Biopsies of metastatic sites were performed at baseline, on therapy and at progression for single-nuclei RNA sequencing (10X genomics, 5’ v1.1). After stringent quality control and cell type annotation, we compared the proportions and transcriptomic signatures of tumor and immune cell subsets between responders and non-responders, and explored their evolution during treatment. Pseudobulk analyses were used to classify whole samples according to the consensus molecular classification (Kamoun et al. 2020).



 We enrolled 32 patients among whom eight (25%) achieved objective response (OR). All patients underwent biopsies at baseline, 6 (19%) on therapy, 17 (53%) at progression. Tumor cells showed high transcriptomic heterogeneity within the consensus groups, with the coexistence of basal and luminal cell states within the same samples. The proportion of basal cells at baseline, but not the basal sample classification, was associated with an increased OR (p=0.02). Immune features associated with resistance to ICI at baseline involved both myeloid and lymphoid compartments : within myeloid cells, an abundance of pro-tumoral HES1 macrophages and higher expression of immunosuppressive genes CD163, MS4A4A and STAB1 ; within T cells, a higher proportion of exhausted CD8+ lymphocytes, and higher expression of immune checkpoint genes including PDCD1. Conversely, the baseline abundance of CD4+ naive T helpers was associated with improved OR. Longitudinal sampling showed potential adaptive resistance mechanisms at progression, including downregulation of HLA genes and IFN signaling in tumor cells ; shift from M1 to M2 macrophage polarization within myeloid cells; increased expression of immune checkpoints, downregulation of type-I interferon induced genes and cytotoxicity markers such as GZMA in T cells. Individual patient analyses have shown that these mechanisms may coexist with discrete patterns.



 We identified potential mechanisms of resistance to ICI in patients with mUC related to both tumor and immune compartments, including specific T cell and macrophage subpopulations. Longitudinal assessments in patients show individual molecular patterns related to progression that may allow for dynamic and tailored therapeutic strategies.

 c-MYC (MYC) is a central regulatory protein that is dysregulated in >50% of all human cancers and is linked to aggressive disease. Developing MYC inhibitors would revolutionize cancer treatment; however, efforts to target MYC directly using small molecular inhibitors have historically failed. A promising approach is to identify and inhibit critical MYC partner proteins to inactivate MYC and trigger cancer cell death. Inhibiting these targets therapeutically can result in synthetic lethality (MYC-SL), which can be exploited in MYC-dysregulated cancers. To identify MYC-SL targets, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screen using an isogenic pair of non-transformed and MYC-driven breast cancer cells. In contrast to other screens, this model is both dependent on MYC and recapitulates human disease at pathological and molecular levels in vivo. Finally, these hits were cross-referenced with our MYC protein-interactome data to reveal putative MYC partner proteins that are critical for MYC activity.
 From our screen results, we performed gene set enrichment analysis to identify biological activities that may represent core functional dependencies in MYC dysregulated cancer cells. Using this approach, we identified and validated topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) as an actionable vulnerability that can be targeted with clinically approved inhibitors. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of TOP1 in multiple orthogonal assays resulted in MYC-driven cell death. Finally, drug response to TOP1 inhibitors correlated with MYC levels and activity across panels of breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids, highlighting TOP1 as a promising target for MYC-driven cancers.
 The recent accessibility of large-scale datasets detailing functional dependencies across hundreds of cancer cell lines offers an unprecedented opportunity to prioritize targets with greater translational relevance, which is a major limitation of the synthetic-lethal approach for target discovery. As a secondary analysis of our hits, we utilized DEPMAP data to classify cancer cell lines as relatively MYC-dependent or MYC-independent, enabling the in silico evaluation of each MYC-SL hit’s differential essentiality. MYC-SLs that exhibited selective essentiality in MYC-dependent cell lines were prioritized for further investigation. Results from this strategy revealed critical MYC cofactors that have been validated by us and others (e.g., CDK9), providing confidence in this approach. Excitingly, previously underexplored targets were identified with promising validation to-date. Together, this work features two successful strategies to prioritize hits from hundreds of synthetic-lethal genome-wide CRISPR screens to identify novel MYC-driven vulnerabilities in cancer.

        <tr id="Despite advances in cancer immunotherapies across various cancers, survival outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) with these agents remain largely unsatisfactory despite the high tumour burden. Colorectal stem cells (CSCs), especially LGR5+ CSCs, are the significant drivers in CRC initiation, progression and resistance to conventional therapies. Although native immune surveillance is sufficient to combat early tumour formation, CRC evades early immune detection with its well-documented adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence. The exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon still needs to be better understood. SRY-related HMG box gene 17 (SOX17), a transcription factor that specifies embryonic gut formation, is increasingly recognised as a significant factor in CRC tumourigenesis. However, its role as a tumour suppressor or oncogene is still debated. Evidence from a recent study highlighted the critical role of SOX17 in reshaping the tumour immune ecosystem through the simultaneous inhibition of CD8+ T cells and selective suppression of LGR5 expression in CSCs through transcriptional repression, thereby facilitating disease progression. Given its role in immune evasion, SOX17 could be a promising marker in personalised therapy. Additionally, SOX17 could play a role in the diagnostic arena, potentially identifying dysplasia in the gastrointestinal tract. Future clinical, basic and genetic studies focusing on SOX17 are needed to ascertain its mechanistic role in tumour immunomodulation in CRC and diagnosing preneoplastic lesions in the gastrointestinal tract.">

        <tr id="Escherichia coli (E.coli) strains carrying the polyketide synthase (pks) island produce the genotoxin colibactin associated with pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The colibactin polyketide induces DNA damage through direct alkylation of DNA, which leads to characteristic mutational A-T rich signatures in the genome (SBS28 and SBS88) that can be identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS). Since WGS is not routinely used clinically, we developed an approach to specifically identify SBS-pks using a clinical targeted exon capture assay, MSK-IMPACT. In an institutional pan-cancer clinical cohort of 78,905 tumors we identified 15,967 samples with >20 mutations detected by MSK-IMPACT. We identified 149/1845 samples with microsatellite stable CRC with >10% mutations attributable to SBS-pks. Examining clinicopathologic and genomic features of SBS-pks+ compared to SBS-pks- CRC tumors, we find that SBS-pks+ signatures are significantly enriched in younger age of onset compared to SBS-pks- CRC patients (median age 52 vs 57, p=0.00059). While global genomic features and oncogenic pathways are similar, we find that the APC:c835-8A>G splice site mutation is overrepresented in SBS-pks+ tumors with 21.7% enrichment compared to 4.99% in SBS-pks- tumors, even further enriched in young onset SBS-pks+ CRC (27% <50 y, 31% <45 y, p<0.0001). To mechanistically investigate colibactin-associated damage we developed a novel long-term human colon organoid-microbe co-culture model system that takes advantage of reversal of polarity in suspension culture. WGS of human CRC organoids co-cultured for three months with pks+ and delta-pks E.coli NC101 confirmed induction of SBS-pks signatures, validating the model. 48h acute exposure to pks+ E.coli upregulates DNA replication and DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways coupled with cell cycle stalling in S phase with activation of ATM/ATR, indicative of replication stress. Strikingly, pks+ E.coli exposure drives a phenotypic shift of tumor and normal epithelial cells into an intestinal stem cell (ISC) state, with pks+ exposed cells demonstrating increased regeneration and proliferation, while thermal proximity coaggregation-MS analysis of protein complexes reveals global chromatin remodeling changes. Thus, our findings suggest that colibactin SBS signature is associated with young onset CRC and that the colibactin genotoxin phenotypically promotes cells to enter a proliferative intestinal stem cell states as precursors to CRC carcinogenesis. Correlating our clinicogenomic findings of an increased pks+ signature presence in young onset patients, we propose a model of colibactin injury in which younger, DNA replication and repair proficient cells are able to overcome colibactin-associated DDR stress, while aged colonic cells exit DDR stress through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, resulting in the overall observed enriched genomic colibactin signature in young onset CRC.

 In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), genetic mutations distort hematopoietic differentiation, resulting in the accumulation of leukemic blasts. However, it remains unclear how these mutations intersect with the cellular origins of each patient's disease, and whether distinct sets of mutations converge upon similar differentiation patterns. Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled high-resolution mapping of the relationship between leukemia and normal hematopoietic cell states. Yet, this application has been hampered by imprecise reference maps of normal hematopoiesis, or by small patient cohort sizes which do not adequately capture the extent of inter-patient heterogeneity in AML. To resolve this, we constructed a reference atlas of human bone marrow hematopoiesis from 263,519 single-cell transcriptomes enriched for rare hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The resulting reference spans 55 cellular states and has been benchmarked against independent datasets of purified HSPCs. Using this comprehensive reference atlas, we confidently mapped over 1.2 million single-cell transcriptomes from 318 patient samples spanning AML, mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), and acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) diagnoses. Single-cell composition analysis revealed twelve patient subgroups, each reflecting distinct patterns of aberrant differentiation in AML. Strikingly, some AML samples exhibited virtually no overlap in cell state involvement with one another, likely reflecting their disparate cellular origins. One subgroup was enriched for early lymphoid progenitors and featured co-clustering of AML and MPAL samples. Notably, this early lymphoid subgroup included an AML sample which eventually relapsed with lymphoid disease. To understand the genetic determinants of aberrant differentiation in AML, we quantified leukemia cell state abundance in >1,200 patient samples and evaluated genotype-to-phenotype associations to link >40 genetic driver alterations with their specific impacts on AML differentiation. This identified genetic drivers for unconventional lineage phenotypes in AML, including erythroid lineage priming associated with the co-occurrence of complex cytogenetics with TP53 mutations as well as lymphoid lineage priming associated with bi-allelic RUNX1 mutations. We also identified non-genetic determinants of AML differentiation. For example, we identified two subgroups of KMT2A-rearranged AML with distinct cellular origins reflecting either HSPCs or committed myeloid precursors. Last, we show that distinct leukemia cell hierarchies can co-exist within individual patients, providing insights into AML evolution. Together, single-cell reference mapping of malignant cell states provides a framework for understanding the impact of genetic alterations on hematopoietic differentiation across hundreds of individual AML patients.

 Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly brain tumor that often develops resistance to DSB-inducing therapeutics due to dysregulated DNA repair. Ionizing radiation (IR) targets these cancer cells by causing DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs). However, GBM often has overactive genes involved in the error-free DSB-repair process known as Homologous Recombination (HR). This results in therapy resistance and poor patient outcomes. Here, we provide an alternative approach to target DSB-resistant GBM by modulating the dNTP pool instead of solely targeting DNA-repair proteins. Through a comet assay, we found that increasing the dNTP pool prior to IR resulted in impaired DSB-repair. Immunofluorescence analysis of key HR proteins revealed significant disruptions in end resection, a necessary phase of HR. Our RNA-seq results show that increasing the dNTP pool prior to IR treatment caused significant changes in gene expression when compared to IR or dN treatment alone. Pathways most affected include apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the significant increase in apoptosis in irradiated cancer cells with elevated dNTP pools. Not only do these data suggest that HR efficiency is reduced due to end resection impairment, but they also show that as a result, cell viability is destabilized due to prolonged DNA damage, resulting in apoptosis. The identification of this impairment may be essential in finding novel therapeutic approaches to sensitize therapy-resistant GBM.

 Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is an aggressive tumor type accounting for 30% of all lung cancers, with a roughly 30% 5-year survival. The genetic nature of these tumors precludes the use of targeted therapies and the standard immunotherapy, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, results in response rates below 50% after biomarker selection. Better patient selection for immunotherapy regimens requires a better definition of the molecular and immune landscape of LUSC. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively characterize the molecular, clinical and immune context of LUSC to identify novel biomarkers that can guide treatment decisions and to find novel therapeutic targets.



 A multiparametric study including a targeted DNA and RNA sequencing of genes related to tumor-immune system crosstalk was conducted in a cohort of 98 early-stage LUSC patients. Histopathological features including immune infiltrate and metabolic traits were defined by in the LUSC tissues. Consensus clustering algorithm classified the sample transcriptomes, and all this data was cross-analyzed with clinical, molecular and immune annotations.



 Computational analysis of immuno-oncology gene expression data from 98 LUSC tumors led to the classification in 4 patient subgroups with specific molecular and immune characteristics. Interestingly, we found a genomic amplification of the chromosome region 3q, present in almost 30% of the patients, strongly associated with the low immunogenic, as previously shown, and high tumorigenic subgroup. To know the mechanism behind this robust association and given the nature of relevant genes in this region, we analyzed iron accumulation in the tumor samples. We found that iron-positive tumors showed a reduced infiltration of CD8+ T cells compared to iron-negative tumours. The same tendency was observed in CD4, CD20 and CD68 analyses, further supporting an association of this amplification and iron accumulation with a low immunogenic tumor profile. These results were validated in an independent cohort of early-stage LUSC.



 Taken together, our results support the possible connection between iron accumulation and 3q amplification as a mechanism for immune exclusion in LUSC. We believe that this molecular alteration can be clinically relevant as a biomarker for immunotherapy selection in LUSC, at least in a neoadjuvant setting. Whether this association applies to other squamous carcinomas or might represent novel therapeutic vulnerabilities ensures further research

 Background:
 Cells possess a complex DNA damage response (DDR) system to prevent detrimental mutations from accumulating. The genes encoding various DDR components are frequently mutated in cancer cells and provide potential sites for therapeutic intervention. DNA damaging agents, with one exception, are repaired by the global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) pathway. Our novel class of drugs, Illudins, are the exception as Illudin-induced DNA damage is not recognized by GG-NER and can only be repaired by the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway. Studies utilizing isogeneic cell lines completely deficient in specific TC-NER proteins (e.g. homozygous ERCC6 knockout) indicate these cells are extremely sensitive to Illudins (up to 30-fold). In contrast, cells deficient in GG-NER activity are not sensitive to our drugs. Moreover, non-replicating or normal cells are minimally affected by Illudins, as evidenced by the lack of systemic toxicity in humans treated with one of our drugs. In TC-NER deficient cancer cells, however, our drug ITX-0121 blocks the TC-NER polymerase complex, which disengages from DNA, and initiates the irreversible process of apoptosis or cellular suicide. Many cancers exhibit deficiencies in DDR mechanisms and cannot properly repair DNA damage.
 Methods:
 Analysis of the GENIE Database indicates that the overall incidence of TC-NER deficient cancers in solid tumors is ~10%, and includes all major histological classifications (breast, ovarian, endometrial, prostate, renal, bladder, bone, colorectal, liver, lung, skin, pancreatic, thyroid, etc.) or ~175,000 new patients annually. These cancers, however, possess monoallelic mutations, as opposed to biallelic, and thus have some residual TC-NER functionality. To determine the relative sensitivity of cancers with monoallelic alterations in TC-NER genes, we generated colorectal HCT-116 cells with a monoallelic deletion in a single TC-NER gene. For example, we are generating daughter cell lines with small monoallelic deletions in ERCC2, ERCC3, ERCC4, ERCC6, and ELOF1 genes.
 Results:
 We are comparing sensitivity of these daughter lines to our lead drug ITX-0121, as well as to other DNA damaging agents such as cisplatin. Preliminary results indicate a monoallelic alteration in a TC-NER gene can confer > 6-fold sensitivity to ITX-0121, which is clinically relevant based on PK results. Based on these PK results, we believe the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ITX-0121 in patients to be > 1.2 mg/kg; yet only 0.4 mg/kg will be sufficient for clinical efficacy against cancers that are phenotypically TC-NER deficient.
 Conclusions:
 Thus, despite the administration of a cytotoxic agent, TC-NER deficient cancer patients can be treated at a non-toxic dose; if toxicity occurs, it should be limited to transient thrombocytopenia, as indicated by prior studies.

        <tr id="The diploid genome of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans is highly heterozygous, with most allele pairs diverging at either the coding or regulatory level. When faced with selection pressure like antifungal exposure, this hidden genetic diversity can provide a reservoir of adaptive mutations through loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events. Validating the potential phenotypic impact of LOH events observed in clinical or experimentally evolved strains can be difficult due to the challenge of precisely targeting one allele over the other. Here, we show that a CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used to overcome this challenge. By designing allele-specific guide RNA sequences, we can induce targeted, directed LOH events, which we validate by whole-genome long-read sequencing. Using this approach, we efficiently recapitulate a recently described LOH event that increases resistance to the antifungal fluconazole. Additionally, we find that the recombination tracts of these induced LOH events have similar lengths to those observed naturally. To facilitate future use of this method, we provide a database of allele-specific sgRNA sequences for Cas9 that provide near genome-wide coverage of heterozygous sites through either direct or indirect targeting. This approach will be useful in probing the adaptive role of LOH events in this important human pathogen.">

        <tr id="The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system is a powerful genome editing tool that has revolutionized research. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common form of genetic variation in humans. Only a subset of these SNPs has been shown to be linked to genetic diseases, while the biological relevance of the majority remains unclear. Investigating these variants of unknown significance could provide valuable insights into their roles in biological processes, disease susceptibility, and treatment responses. While CRISPR/Cas has emerged as a transformative technology, its ability to make single nucleotide substitutions remains a significant limitation. Other techniques in single nucleotide editing, such as base editing and prime editing, offer promising possibilities to complement CRISPR/Cas systems, though they also have their own limitations. Hence, alternative approaches are necessary to overcome the limitations of CRISPR. Here, to improve the feasibility of generating single base edits in the genome, we provide a protocol that introduces a multiple expression and dual selection (MEDS) system, which, alongside CRISPR, utilizes the opposing roles of cytosine deaminase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (CD/UPRT) for negative selection and neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT II) for positive selection. As a proof of concept and to demonstrate feasibility of the method, we used MEDS, along with traditional CRISPR-Cas9, to generate sickle hemoglobin by introducing a point mutation (A → T) in the sixth codon of the hemoglobin beta gene.">

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) has been classified into molecular subtypes using gene-level data from both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), leading to the development of the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) and intrinsic CMS (iCMS). In addition to CRC studies, scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics characterization of human polyps, aligned with the conventional adenoma and serrated polyps, identified distinct driver mutations, cells-of-origin and iCMS traits associated with each polyp type. These gene-level transcriptional classification approaches were both strongly aligned to mutations underpinning the Vogelstein model of CRC development.
 However, when viewed using pathway-level information, the most dominant mechanistic signaling cascades in CRC were completely independent of these same mutational drivers. Therefore, to deliver a holistic landscape-view of the tumor ecosystem, we proposed that pathway-level subtyping could offer a broader understanding of non-genetic phenotypic signaling in CRC, leading to more informative stratification and therapeutic decision-making.
 Using this new approach in combination with bulk transcriptional data from n=1200+ tumors, alongside n=29, 452 scRNA-seq profiles derived from murine organoids, and n=49, 155 epithelial cells derived from n=63 human tumor samples, we identified three pathway-derived subtypes (PDS1-3), revealing previously overlooked changes in epithelial cell identities and phenotypic states. PDS2 represents tumors with stroma/immune-dense, regenerative stem-like features. PDS1 were associated with elevated MYC signaling, proliferation and canonical stem-cells with good prognosis, while PDS3 displayed a differentiated-like phenotype associated with reduced polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC)-mediated gene repression and poorer prognosis.
 The inverse relationship between MYC/PRC targets within PDS1/PDS3 tumors supported the development of stem maturation index, which was directly related to cellular entropy and differentiation status of colonic cells allowing our tumor data to be projected onto a Waddington’s landscape. Given these associations with developmental patterns in established tumors, we next utilized the same pathway-level approach in combination with transcriptional data derived from n=2641 human polyps, where we observe that PDS traits can be established early in precancer development. Using a combination of trajectory analyzes, lineage identities and cellular phenotyping, these approaches have again revealed that, even in very early precancers, there is no association between Vogelstein-related mutational drivers and prominent phenotypic signaling cascades.
 While work is ongoing, the use of pathway-level information provides a unique insight into the dynamic nature of phenotypic evolution across early-to-late stages of colorectal precancers and tumors.

 Lung adenocarcinoma in never smokers (NS-LUAD) has a high mortality rate. Compared to LUAD from patients with smoking history, NS-LUAD are less sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) potentially due to differences in tumor mutational burden and immune microenvironment. Knowledge of NS-LUAD phenotypic plasticity and cell composition can provide guidance for prognosis and treatment. However, previous studies of LUAD gene expression landscape were predominantly conducted in smokers and full transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) was only examined in a few dozens of NS-LUAD. By investigating cell dynamics through RNA-seq data from 684 NS-LUAD, we identified three gene expression-based subtypes that encapsulate tumors’ clinical, morphological, and genomic features. The ‘steady’ subtype features low proliferation markers and high fraction of alveolar cells, while it is depleted of TP53 mutations and ALK fusions. With its moderate-to-well differentiated morphological features, this subtype is associated with prolonged overall survival and predicted favorable response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, independent of the PD1/PD-L1 expression levels. The ‘proliferative’ subtype features increased proliferation, and enrichment of TP53 mutations and ALK and other gene fusions. The ‘chaotic’ subtype is characterized by elevated levels of mesenchymal cell state, increased proportions of cancer associated fibroblasts and histologic features of mixed-lineage, and is associated with worst overall survival, even within stage I tumors. We derived a signature of 60 genes’ expression sufficient to recapitulate the transcriptomic classification and validated it in an independent NS-LUAD dataset. This 60-gene signature strongly predicted survival even within subgroups based on tumor stage and beyond known molecular or morphological features, confirming its importance for NS-LUAD prognostication in clinical settings.

 Advancements in drug design have resulted in the development of approved and investigational agents targeting KRAS-driven tumors. RIT1 is a GTPase protein that shares homology and oncogenic activation mechanisms with KRAS and plays a role in cell division and resistance to apoptosis. In this study, we aimed to characterize the landscape of RIT1 alterations across a pan-cancer cohort to assess its frequency and potential as an oncogenic driver.



 Tumor content, ploidy and allelic specific copy number of 86, 039 tumor-normal matched samples sequenced clinically with a targeted sequencing panel (MSK-IMPACT) were analyzed with FACETS. Low purity (<20%) and indetermined copy number samples were excluded. Presence of RIT1 amplifications (Amp), structural variants, oncogenic mutations (Mut), and concurrent OncoKb oncogenic/likely-oncogenic alterations in other genes were evaluated. Co-occurrence and mutual-exclusivity (Co-Me) analyses were performed using DISCOVER. RIT1-altered samples were evaluated for genomic complexity compared to wild-type (WT) samples. False discovery rate correction was applied when appropriate.



 After removing low-quality samples, 63, 270 cancer samples were included, and 1.32% (n=838) were found to harbor RIT1 oncogenic alterations. Most RIT1-alterations observed were Amps (735/838) followed by somatic mutations (Muts) (83/838), concomitant Mut and Amp (2/838) and structural variants (18/838). The most frequent RIT1 Mut was p.M90I (n=40), followed by p.F82C (n=17), p.A77T (n=11) and R122Q (n=9).Uterine carcinosarcomas (5.5%), hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (4.9%) and triple-negative breast cancer (4.7%) had the highest prevalence of RIT1 alterations. Restricting the analysis only to Muts, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (n=15; 0.22%) and bladder cancers (n=13; 0.51%) had the highest number of oncogenic RIT1 Muts. RIT1-mutant samples had higher TMBs than RIT1-WT samples (p<0.01). This association was conserved when accounting for histology in bladder cancer and LUAD (p<0.01). RIT1 Amps were associated with higher fraction of genome altered (p<0.01) and co-occurred with amps of neighboring genes NTRK1 (p<0.01) and AKT3 (p<0.01) across most tumor types. DISCOVER assisted Co-Me analysis identified RIT1 Muts as mutually exclusive with EGFR Muts in LUAD (p<0.01). Among RIT1-mutant samples, 10/15 (66%) LUADs harbored RIT1 as the sole identifiable oncogene driver alteration, whereas only 3/13 (23%) bladder cancers were otherwise driver negative.



 RIT1 alterations appear to be rare across most tumor types. Higher TMB and rarity of RIT1 Muts and the observation of RIT1 Amps frequently co-amplified with other chromosome 1 arm q genes, suggest that these alterations might be primarily passengers. These results have implications for stakeholders interested in developing potential therapies for RIT1 as the landscape of these alterations has not been previously explored.

        <tr id="Background Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a lethal malignancy with a high recurrence and distant metastasis rate, posing significant challenges to patient prognosis. Recent studies suggest that tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) can modulate immune cell infiltration and influence tumor initiation and progression. However, the potential clinical significance of TANs in HNSCC remains insufficiently explored. Methods TANs-specific marker genes were identified via single-cell sequencing data from HNSCC. Based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a prognostic risk model was constructed using TANs cell marker genes, and the model was validated with data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The associations between the TANs signature and clinical characteristics, functional pathways, immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint expression, and responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, were then investigated. Cell counting kit‐8(CCK-8), Transwell, and wound healing assays were conducted to assess the functional role of TANs marker molecules. Results TANs characteristic genes were identified from single-cell sequencing data from HNSCC patients. On the basis of these characteristic genes, a tumor-associated neutrophils-associated signature (NRS) was developed and validated across internal and external cross-platform cohorts through comprehensive procedures. The NRS demonstrated robust and reliable performance in predicting overall survival. Additionally, patients with a low NRS showed enhanced immune cell infiltration, active lipid metabolism, and increased sensitivity to immunotherapy. In contrast, patients with a high NRS exhibited poor prognostic outcomes, advanced clinical stages, and significant associations with HNSCC metastasis and progression. Furthermore, we identified a TANs-associated biomarker, OLR1, and validated that OLR1 promotes HNSCC proliferation, invasion, and migration through CCK-8, Transwell invasion, and wound healing assays. Conclusion This study has developed a promising TANs-based tool that may aid in personalized treatment and prognostic management for patients with HNSCC.

        <tr id="Autophagy suppresses tumorigenesis in normal cells, but in established tumors, it can promote tumor progression, particularly by enhancing resistance to stress. However, the mechanism underlying this tumor-promoting function remains unclear. To investigate this, we adopted an interdisciplinary approach combining database analysis with experimental validation. Specifically, by classifying the autophagy-related genes using AutoML analysis on their expression patterns in the COSMIC database, we identified an autophagy subnetwork that correlated with the PLK1-RAD9A axis, a pathway we had previously linked to genotoxic resistance. Cell-based experiments confirmed that autophagy enhanced PLK1 expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels, facilitating genotoxic resistance. Notably, in stressed S-phase cells, we found that PLK1 expression levels varied among individual cells, yet overall cell population acquired genotoxin resistance. The genotoxin resistance in the cell population with heterogeneous PLK1 expression was driven by autophagy by facilitating the secretion of currently unidentified factors, likely by switching funtion of RAD9A from DNA checkpoint to substance secretion. Together our data demonstrate that intra-tumor heterogeneity contributes to the malignant features of tumors through an autophagy-PLK-RAD9A axis that promotes intercellular communication via secretion.

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a significant global health burden, highlighting the urgent need for innovative and effective treatment options. This study focuses on the discovery and validation of novel therapeutic targets, particularly synthetic lethal (SL) interactions, to exploit specific genetic vulnerabilities in CRC cells and enable the development of safer and more effective therapies. We employed a comprehensive strategy integrating healthy cells, genetically engineered isogenic cancer models derived from human intestinal stem cells (hISCs) with patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and primary cell cultures. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we introduced key CRC-associated mutations into the hISCs to replicate disease-specific contexts. Transcriptome profiling, coupled with machine learning, validated these models as robust, clinically relevant representations of tumor biology by aligning them with clinical datasets. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screenings conducted across the isogenic and patient-derived models revealed actionable vulnerabilities, including the identification of genes that are synthetically lethal with APC and KRAS mutations. Discovered SL targets were rigorously validated in vitro and in vivo using patient-derived cells with matching mutational profiles. This integrative approach bridges preclinical and clinical research, ensuring translational relevance. By identifying and validating SL targets tailored to CRC mutational landscapes, we provide a robust foundation for the development of novel treatment options for CRC patients.

 Ovarian cancer is a lethal heterogenous disease that is typically diagnosed at late stages. In high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), the most common subtype, PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy are standard of care. Although HGSOC patients are responsive to these therapies, resistance develops and patients invariably relapse. Alterations in genes within the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT network are highly prevalent. Although specific PI3K and AKT small molecule inhibitors have been developed and clinically evaluated, to date none have been approved for clinical use in ovarian cancer patients. To identify collateral druggable vulnerabilities to AKT hyperactivation and develop novel combination therapies in HGSOC, we have performed a CRISPR-based genome-wide synthetic lethal screen. The goal is to identify genes that upon genetic knockout transform a cytostatic cellular response to PI3Ki/AKTi to a cytotoxic one. Using this platform, we have identified genes that regulate integrin signaling as a major mechanism of synthetic lethality against the PI3Ki pictilisib and the AKTi capivasertib. ITGAV, encoding the integrin subunit αV, was a significant dropout against both kinase inhibitors. Pharmacological targeting of integrin αV synergized with pictilisib and capivasertib to induce apoptotic cell death in multiple cell line models of ovarian cancer, as well as patient-derived organoids. Combined PI3K/AKT and integrin αV inhibition induced DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. The mechanisms underlying induction of DNA damage and cell death in response to combination treatment are currently under investigation. The ultimate goal is to bring this combination treatment approach to HGSOC patients and shed new light on mechanisms of resistance to PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors in ovarian cancer.

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, and its complex pathogenesis and significant tumor cell heterogeneity remain major challenges. With the rapid development of single-cell sequencing technology, we can now delve deeper into the cellular composition and dynamic changes within the tumor microenvironment, revealing cellular interactions and their potential roles in tumorigenesis.In this study, we systematically analyzed comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing data from 25 colorectal cancer and 10 adjacent normal tissue samples. We explored the characteristics and biological significance of tumor cell subpopulations, performed quality control, dimensionality reduction, and cell type identification, and further investigated epithelial cell copy number variations, cell communication, and pseudotime analysis. Subsequently, Boruta feature selection algorithm was combined to identify prognosis related genes. The expression patterns, clinical significance and biological effects of PRSS22 were validated in vitro.Our analysis found an epithelial cell subcluster with high expression of PRSS22 exhibited high proliferation and migration abilities, and it was also associated with the dysregulated immune microenvironment. After further experimental verification, we proved the high expression patterns and clinical significance of PRSS22. Downregulation of PRSS22 in CRC cells resulted in a reduction of proliferation, migration and invasion.Our study has identified a cell subcluster that is closely linked to progression, immune dysregulation and prognosis in CRC, and we have also identified PRSS22 as its hub gene that has great potential to become a new immunotherapeutic targets target for CRC.">

        <tr id="Cervical and other anogenital malignancies are largely caused by E6 and E7 oncogenes of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), which inhibit important tumor suppressors like p53 and pRb when they are persistently activated. The main goal of traditional treatments is to physically or chemically kill cancer cells, but they frequently only offer temporary relief, have serious side effects, and have a high risk of recurrence. Exploring the efficacy and accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in both inducing death in HPV-infected cancer cells and restoring the activity of tumor suppressors is our main goal. In this study, we propose a novel precision oncology strategy that targets and inhibits the detrimental effects of the E6 and E7 oncogenes using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system. In order to do this, we create unique guide RNAs that target the integrated HPV DNA and reactivate p53 and pRb. Reactivation is meant to halt aberrant cell development and restart the cell’s natural dying pathways. This review discusses the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in targeting HPV oncogenes, with a focus on studies that have demonstrated its promise in cancer treatment. Given the absence of a definitive treatment for papillomavirus infection and its subsequent association with various cancers, future clinical trials and experimental investigations appear essential to establish and evaluate the therapeutic potential of CRISPR-based approaches. This approach provides a less invasive alternative to conventional treatments and opens the door to personalized care that considers the genetic makeup of each patient’s tumor.">

 Background:
 HRD is linked to sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors across various tumor types. However, the presence of HRD, driver events (such as pathogenic mutations in HR genes or other genomic alterations), and its clinical relevance in mCRC remain underexplored.
 Methods:
 We performed the VHIO-300 test, an ISO15189 accredited custom NGS panel profiling over 450 genes (including HR-related genes:
 ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2 or PALB2
 ) on 356 Stage IV mCRC patients (corresponding to 247 primary colorectal and 109 to metastatic samples) enrolled in the Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology’s Molecular Prescreening Program from June 2021 to December 2024. All samples had a tumor cellularity > 40% as per pathologist evaluation
 .
 An HR score (sHR) based on genome-wide copy number alterations (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) patterns is generated. After cross-validation with Myriad MyChoice, sHR ≥ 56 was established based on a cohort of ovarian tumors and used to identify HRD in mCRC tumor samples.
 Results:
 HRD prevalence was 3.4% in our mCRC cohort (12/356), but, much higher in metastatic lesions, (6.4%, 7/109) than in primary samples (2.03%, 5/247) (p = 0.05). In fact, the median sHR between primary (21) vs. metastases (30) in CRC was significantly different (p < 0.01). Regarding HR gene status, HR-mutated samples were not significantly within the HRD group (p = 0.27) and only 6.5% (2/31) were HRD. Noteworthy,
 BRCA2
 exhibits a frameshift deletion in a homopolymer stretch, that is a frequent hotspot in microsatellite instable (MSI) tumors, but this event was not found to be associated with HRD. In fact, all HRD tumors (n = 12) were microsatellite stable (MSS). Other frequent alterations in mCRC were studied and
 BRAF
 mutations were found to be present in 42% of HRD tumors (p < 0.01). Inversely, HRD was rare in
 KRAS
 -mutated samples (0.7%; 1/140) and, in fact, highly correlated with non-HRD status (p = 0.02), especially the G12 mutation (p < 0.01). Interestingly, CNA profiles also revealed a strong association between the
 BCL2L1
 loci gain and HRD (p < 0.01). Clinically, HRD was not significantly associated with prognostic value nor clinical benefit to oxaliplatin-based combinations. However, the limited sample size and heterogeneous treatment lines restricted robust statistical analysis.
 Conclusions:
 This study identified a small, yet significant subset of mCRC that displays HRD. sHR and HRD rates were higher in metastatic lesions vs primary tumors, indicating HR scarring could be accumulating over time in some mCRC patients. No clear association between pathogenic HR gene mutations and HRD were found, suggesting the involvement of alternative molecular mechanisms in this process. Frequent co-occurring events, such as
 BRAF
 mutations or
 BCL2L1
 gains could be drivers in CRC HRD, and shape, eventually, new therapeutic options for these patients in the metastatic setting.

 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal brain cancer. Standard of care treatments (SOC) are limited to surgery, radiation and chemotherapies, providing an average overall survival of only ∼16 months. Tumor heterogeneity and cellular plasticity are major contributions to treatment resistance in this disease. We constructed an integrated patient-level and cohort-level framework and analyzed single-nucleotide RNA sequencing data in matched primary and recurrence specimens to understand tumor heterogeneity, evolution, and drug resistance in SOC treated GBM patients (N=23). Patient-level tumor analysis revealed distinct tumor cell transcriptional subclones representing widespread intra-patient heterogeneity. Tumor evolution analysis from primary to recurrence revealed diverse treatment responses representing sensitive, intrinsic resistant, and acquired resistant subclones. Further characterization of tumor subclones and clustering analyses indicated that tumor heterogeneity under SOC treatments was linked to diverse biological mechanisms including neural development and oncogenic pathways, contributing to varying levels of subclonal resistance. Our analysis also highlighted intrinsic resistance was prominent as primary tumors often harbored substantial proportion of resistant tumor cells. This insight on resistant status at cell level then allowed us to compare resistant to sensitive cells and identify both established and potentially novel mechanisms of SOC resistance that were not always obvious in the comparison between primary and recurrence samples. These included activation of PI3K/AKT, MAPK, TGF-β, EMT, and WNT signaling pathways. Taken together, our novel analytical strategy revealed complex tumor heterogeneity and evolution landscape in SOC treated GBM, offering insights on potential mechanisms driving these phenomena and providing a resource for further exploration and development of therapeutic strategies.

 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is among the most aggressive and lethal lung malignancies, accounting for approximately 14% of all lung cancer cases. Characterized by the loss of TP53 and RB1 in most cases, SCLC exhibits high genomic instability. ATM kinase, a critical DNA damage repair (DDR) protein of the PIKK family, is highly expressed in cancers. High ATM expression correlates with resistance to ATR and PARP inhibitors, and ATM inhibitors improves therapeutic outcomes in DDR-deficient cancers. Despite this, the mechanistic underpinnings of ATM inhibition and its potential therapeutic applications in SCLC remain poorly understood.



 We employed a comprehensive approach that included the analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) data, including RNA-sequencing from approximately 1,000 SCLC clinical samples, representing one of the largest and most comprehensive panels of cases to date. Additionally, we utilized an IC50 panel of two ATM inhibitors across a diverse panel of SCLC cell lines. Bulk RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry data were used to delineate the molecular effects of ATM inhibition. Functional assays, including western blot, qRT-PCR, cell cycle, and apoptosis analyses, were conducted to explore cell death pathways under ATM inhibition.



 ATM expression was significantly elevated in SCLC clinical specimens, particularly in tumors with high YAP1 expression, as well as those with high co-expression of YAP1, ASCL1, NEUROD1, and/or POU2F3. Sensitivity to ATM inhibition was greater in SCLC cell lines than in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with vulnerability linked to the unfolded protein response and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed that ATM inhibition led to the downregulation of several oncogenic signaling pathways, including MYC and PI3K/AKT, and an upregulation of DNA damage response genes. ATM inhibition also increased intracellular oxidative stress, promoting cell death through apoptosis. Importantly, ATM inhibition synergized with standard chemotherapy agents, significantly enhancing therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models.



 Our findings highlight ATM as a critical therapeutic target in SCLC. ATM inhibition rewires the SCLC transcriptome and proteome, downregulating oncogenic pathways and enhancing the effectiveness of existing chemotherapy. This novel role of ATM provides a strong rationale for developing combination therapies targeting DDR and associated oncogenic pathways, paving the way for improved drug development and patient outcomes in SCLC.

 The amplification of oncogenes on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is common in cancer and associated with poor outcomes. Uneven inheritance of ecDNA during cell division leads to intratumoral ecDNA copy number heterogeneity. However, the relationship between shifts in ecDNA copy number and the rapid environmental adaptation of cancer cells remains unclear. In this study, we utilized imaging and single-cell multi-omics analyses to demonstrate that the transcript and protein expression of ecDNA oncogenes, along with functional heterogeneity, correlate with ecDNA copy number heterogeneity. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and live-cell imaging, we found that cells with “middle” ecDNA copy numbers display the highest growth rates compared to cells with the lowest or highest copy number statuses, indicating greatest fitness is achieved by the balance of promoting cell proliferation while minimizing heightened replication stress arising from increasing copy numbers of ecDNA oncogenes. Through simulations based on random segregation and optimal copy number models, we found that ecDNA-bearing cells can rapidly adjust their copy numbers to achieve optimal growth in new environments. Notably, compared to chromosomally amplified cells, those with ecDNA exhibited superior growth following xenograft injection and treatment with single drugs targeting replication stress or oncogenes, aligning with our simulation findings. Our results reveal that functional heterogeneity resulting from uneven ecDNA inheritance enhances cancer cells' adaptability to tumor microenvironments and rapid acquisition of drug resistance, warranting that the development of combinatorial therapies that synergistically target a wide range of copy numbers is critical for effectively treating ecDNA-containing cancers.

 Half of of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop metastatic CRC (mCRC) with a low survival rate. Epigenetic abnormalities in promoters and enhancers play a significant role in CRC advancement and hold promise for diagnosis and therapy and over 5, 000 variable enhancer loci (VELs) have been shown to be gained/lost in mCRC. Here, the functional impact of these VELs on driving CRC progression was explored. We designed a CRISPRi library including 1, 524 VELs gained or lost specifically in CRC cell lines, the top 500 essential genes for the cell line as positive controls, 1, 000 non-targeting guides as negative controls and 6 sgRNAs per site, cloned into a lentiviral plasmid. CRISPR screen was applied to the HCT116-dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 cells for NGS. Anticancer potentials of silenced VELs were evaluated by in vitro assays (i.e MTT assay, apoptosis, cell cycle assay, 3D bioprinting). Chromosomal interactions and epigenetic state were analyzed by Chromosome conformation capture (3C) coupled with sequencing (Hi-C), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing. We identified 12 depleted VELs causing a significant decrease in HCT116 proliferation after CRISPR-mediated silencing. VEL_1243 and VEL_1084 caused the highest level of cell growth inhibition as well as increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HCT116 cells. After silencing both enhancers, 3D bioprinting showed a reduction in key markers of metastasis. HiC-Seq and transcription factor binding data showed long-range interaction of both enhancers with genes such as MYO3B, UBR3 and GINS3 and enrichment for disease-associated TF including RFX7, and ELF3. RNA seq results showed significant transcriptome-wide expression alterations regulated by VEL_1243 and VEL_1084, exemplified by their impact on disease-associated signaling pathways including PI3K-Akt and MAPK. IFNγ response pathway -which is a critical aspect of anti-tumor immunity - was downregulated following both VEL_1243 and VEL_1084 silencing. Given that immune/inflammatory cells (e.g., tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), T-cells, natural killer (NK) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the important components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), we further examined if VELs mediated regulation of TAMs or immune cells controls the TME in a way that promotes tumour growth. M1 were co-cultured with CRC cells knock-down of VELs. Both VELs repression could induce M1 polarization in HCT116 and SW620 cells. Considering M1 macrophages have the capability to promote the Th1 response and engulf and kill target tumor cells, VEL_1084 and VEL_1243 could be potential therapeutic targets for CRC by affecting the polarization of macrophages. VEL_1243 and VEL_1054 regulate CRC-associated phenotypes and warrant further exploration to determine their regulatory role and potential as a novel therapeutic target in CRC.

 Rectal cancer (RC) remains a significant clinical challenge, in part due to chemotherapy resistance encountered in neoadjuvant treatment approaches. To address this, we utilized a unique platform integrating gene expression data from RC tumor tissues and matched patient-derived organoids (PDO). Gene expression data were analyzed using the computational tool Moonlight to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapy response. We hypothesized that combining genomic data from RC PDOs and matched tumors would implicate molecular targets predicting chemotherapy response and clinical outcomes better than targets identified using RC tumor tissue or RC PDO input alone. We analyzed 18 tissue samples and 32 matched PDOs, capturing a comprehensive representation of tumor biology. Our integrative approach involved differential expression analyses (DEAs) and gene regulatory network (GRN) studies, identifying 5,199 genes regulating at least one potential regulon. Focusing on cancer-associated biological processes curated in Moonlight, we highlighted 2,118 regulator-regulon pairs with potential roles in oncogenic processes. Further integration with DEA results revealed 334 regulator-regulon pairs significantly enriched in both tissue and PDO samples, designating these regulators as oncogenic mediators (OMs). Among them, five genes—BTK, CDK1, LAX1, NAT2, and RAD51AP1—were associated with FOLFOX response. Survival analysis across four independent cohorts further validated CDK1, LAX1, NAT2, and RAD51AP1 as indicators of prolonged recurrence-free survival (RFS), demonstrating consistent patterns associated with good prognosis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy response in RC, and validation of these targets is ongoing. Our integrated approach underscores the translational relevance of PDOs and demonstrates the utility of Moonlight in identifying potential therapeutic targets, setting a new benchmark for precision medicine in rectal cancer.

        <tr id="Epigenetic status-altering mutations in chromatin-modifying enzymes are a feature of human diseases, including many cancers. We investigated cellular dependencies, or vulnerabilities, that arise when enhancer function is compromised by loss of the frequently mutated COMPASS family members MLL3 (KMT2C) and MLL4 (KMT2D). We performed a CRISPR dropout screen that revealed a targetable metabolic dependency arising from epigenetic factor deficiency, identifying potential therapies for cancers with epigenetic alterations secondary to MLL3/4-COMPASS dysfunction. We identified strong evidence that there is an internal balance between promoter and enhancer usage dictated by MLL1- versus MLL4-COMPASS, and this equilibrium is subject to disruption during cancer. Using an autochthonous carcinogen model of bladder cancer, we demonstrate that truncated, cytoplasmic MLL4 predicts response to targeted metabolic inhibition therapy for bladder cancer and could be developed as a biomarker for KMT2D-mutated cancers. We also highlight the broader potential for prognosis, patient stratification and treatment decision-making based on KMT2D mutation status in MLL4 truncation-relevant diseases, including human cancers and Kabuki Syndrome. Due to the high prevalence of loss-of-function mutations affecting MLL4 or its COMPASS partner UTX (KDM6A) in bladder cancer, we hypothesized that KMT2D mutation status may predict responsiveness to purine-targeting therapy, including methotrexate and pemetrexed. Our study found that KMT2D mutant bladder cancer cells were selectively dependent on TYMS and showed heightened sensitivity to pemetrexed, a drug that inhibits TYMS, DHFR, and GART. This suggests that targeting multiple enzymes within the one-carbon metabolism and de novo purine synthesis pathway could be promising for the treatment of MLL4/UTX-COMPASS mutant bladder cancer. Based on our previous and current findings, a clinical trial using pemetrexed in MLL4/UTX-COMPASS mutant solid tumors is being launched at Northwestern Medicine.

        <tr id="G-quadruplex (G4) structures are non-canonical nucleic acid conformations that play crucial roles in gene regulation, DNA replication, and telomere maintenance. Recent studies have highlighted G4 ligands as promising anticancer agents due to their ability to modulate oncogene expression and induce DNA damage. By stabilizing G4 structures, these ligands affect tumor progression. Additionally, they have been implicated in tumor immunity modulation, particularly through the activation and immunogenic cell death induction of the cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway. Moreover, their disruption of telomere maintenance and regulation of key oncogenes, such as c-MYC and KRAS, position them as candidates for immune-based therapeutic interventions. Despite their therapeutic potential, challenges remain in optimizing their clinical applications, particularly in patient stratification and elucidating their immunomodulatory effects. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms through which G4 ligands influence tumor progression and immune regulation, highlighting their potential role in future cancer immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are known to be involved in the manifestation of aggressive and therapy-resistant phenotypes in solid tumors. Nevertheless, the effects of dynamic intervention by TAMs on the DNA damage response of cancer cells are largely unexplored. Herein, we report that TAMs modulate the DNA damage repair pathways of ovarian cancer cells in response to platinum-(Pt) based therapeutic regimen. We demonstrate that coculture of TAMs with cancer cells directly upregulate Pol η, along with RAD18 and REV1 of the Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) pathway, while concurrently downregulating components of the high-fidelity nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanism. Consequently, we observed a better survival probability, DNA repair capacity, and enrichment of stemness properties in ovarian cancer cells. DNA bulky adducts produced by cisplatin are resolved through differential activation NER and TLS pathways. However, we elucidated that TAMs provide favorable conditions for activating the error-prone TLS pathway for lesion bypass over damage resolution. Furthermore, cellular crosstalk in cocultured cancer cells stimulates the nuclear translocation and expression of RelA, which recruits Pol η by acting as a potent transcription factor. In fact, with pristimerin-mediated disruption of p65 (RelA) translocation, the cancer cells become more prone to DNA damage-induced cell death and compromised regenerative potential. In both in vitro cell cultures and in vivo mouse xenograft models, cocultured macrophages exhibited predominantly M2-like phenotype with prevalence in the invasive zone of xenograft tumor margins. Taken together, our investigation revealed multifaceted crosstalk-mediated regulation of DNA damage repair between TAMs and ovarian cancer cells.

 The generation and widespread sharing of large somatic mutation datasets has revolutionized our understanding of genetic mechanisms driving cancer initiation and progression. For well-understood mutations, this has created the opportunity for individualized therapeutic intervention in a wide range of malignancies. Beyond these well-characterized mutations, there exists a wide range of alterations that remain poorly understood and which require some kind of functional genomics analysis to determine whether such patients are eligible for the targeted therapy used for more typical mutations in that gene, whether these alterations are passenger mutations that don’t affect throughput on the associated signaling pathway, or reflect another more nuanced phenomenon. Whether using ectopic overexpression in cell lines or generation of genetically modified mice, addressing this problem at scale using functional genomics approaches is challenging. A key limitation is the absence of the original tissue context in which that variant co-evolved with other genetic alterations as well as data on the clinical response of the patient to successive lines of therapy. This can be addressed, in part, by the banking of tissue from patient cohorts who have had comprehensive genomic profiling as part of their routine clinical care. For this purpose, we have established the Gundersen Precision Oncology Cohort.



 The Gundersen Precision Oncology Cohort is a retrospective collection of tissue specimens, NGS reports and associated clinical data from deceased patients who received cancer care at the Gundersen Health System. The cohort is updated twice per year and banked tissue specimens are available for collaborative research studies. High resolution digital pathology whole slide images are available for artificial intelligence and machine learning studies.



 At November 26, 2024 there were data from 908 patients (913 tumors) in the cohort, with specimens tested between 2015 and 2024. 55 tumor types were represented, of which lung (n = 225), colorectal (n = 101), pancreas (n = 69), esophageal (n = 62) and breast (n = 56) were most common. The most common diagnostic companies were STRATA Oncology (n = 533) and Tempus (n = 332). Most patients had testing at a single timepoint, but longitudinal testing is available for 40 patients. We present data from some of the studied subgroups, including atypical point mutations in BRAF as well as fusions affecting BRAF and ROS1.



 This cohort, available for collaborative studies via the Gundersen Cancer Biobank, illustrates the value of banking well-annotated biospecimens to address outstanding questions in oncology.

        <tr id="Abstract The molecular control of epigenetic information relies on hundreds of proteins of diverse function, which cooperate in defining chromatin structure and DNA methylation landscapes. While many individual pathways have been characterized, how different classes of epigenetic regulators interact to build a resilient epigenetic regulatory network (ERN) remains poorly understood. Here, we show that most individual regulators are dispensable for somatic cell fitness, and that robustness emerges from multiple layers of functional cooperation and degeneracy among network components. By disrupting 200 epigenetic regulator genes, individually or in combination, we generated network-wide maps of functional interactions for representative regulators. We found that paralogues represent only a first layer of functional compensation within the ERN, with intra- or inter-class interactions buffering the effects of perturbation in a gene-specific manner: while CREBBP cooperates with multiple acetyltransferases to form a subnetwork that ensures robust chromatin acetylation, ARID1A interacts with regulators from across all functional classes. When combined with oncogene activation, the accumulated epigenetic disorder exposes a synthetic fragility and broadly sensitizes ARID1A-deficient cells to further perturbation. Our findings reveal homeostatic mechanisms through which the ERN sustains somatic cell fitness and uncover how the network remodels as the epigenome is progressively deregulated in disease.">

 The development of targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, CAR-T cells, nanobodies, and combination treatments, has significantly advanced cancer management, particularly for HER2-positive tumors. Despite these advancements, challenges such as instability, high toxicity, immune responses, rapid clearance, drug resistance, and exorbitant manufacturing costs persist. A major contributor to these costs is the reliance on mammalian cell systems for production. Additionally, minimizing off-target effects remains a critical concern for targeted therapies.In this study, we engineered virus-like particles (VLPs) to selectively target HER2-positive tumors with minimal off-target effects. These VLPs were further designed to carry genetically expressed RNA interference (RNAi) systems for in situ gene silencing. Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) was employed to characterize the functionalization of the VLP exterior and verify the packaging of the RNAi cargo. This novel single-cell approach combines targeted tumor homing with siRNA delivery, enabling simultaneous tumor targeting and silencing of the PDL1 gene. The multivalent nature of VLPs allows for the incorporation of multiple peptides, enhancing tumor affinity and specificity. With a size of approximately 35 nm, VLPs exhibit favorable pharmacokinetics, including reduced clearance and effective tumor homing. A key advantage of our approach is the ability to express VLPs in Escherichia coli systems, significantly reducing production costs compared to traditional mammalian cell-based systems, making the therapy more accessible.Our findings demonstrate that intravenously administered HER2-targeting VLPs achieve high specificity and affinity for HER2-positive tumors. Once localized, the VLPs penetrate deeply into tumor tissue, delivering RNAi cargo to silence PDL1 expression. Light sheet microscopy will be used to visualize tumor architecture in three dimensions to further investigate tumor penetration, offering a more comprehensive view than traditional cryosections. By inhibiting tumor growth and recruiting immune cells, this approach offers a dual mechanism of action: direct tumor suppression and enhanced immune-mediated clearance. Furthermore, VLPs provide unique advantages such as efficient cell penetration, scalable production, and robust cargo delivery, positioning them as a promising platform for cost-effective and effective cancer therapies.

        <tr id="Intracellular parasites like Toxoplasma gondii scavenge host nutrients, particularly lipids, to support their growth and survival. Although Toxoplasma is known to adjust its metabolism based on nutrient availability, the mechanisms that mediate lipid sensing and metabolic adaptation remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen under lipid-rich (10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)) and lipid-limited (1% FBS) conditions to identify genes critical for lipid-responsive fitness. We identified the Toxoplasma protein GRA38 as a lipid-dependent regulator of parasite fitness. GRA38 exhibits phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphatase (PAP) activity in vitro, which is significantly reduced by mutation of its conserved DxDxT/V catalytic motif. Disruption of GRA38 led to the accumulation of PA species and widespread alterations in lipid composition, consistent with impaired PAP activity. These lipid imbalances correlated with reduced parasite virulence in mice. Our findings identify GRA38 as a metabolic regulator important for maintaining lipid homeostasis and pathogenesis in Toxoplasma gondii.">

However, the genomic deletions made to generate such nrHSV-1 vectors can result in undersized genomes that trigger genomic instability—including rearrangements and size extensions—compromising their therapeutic potential. This study investigates the stabilization of undersized nrHSV-1 vectors through the insertion of stuffer DNA segments. We assess genomic stability, productivity, toxicity, and transgene expression in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that nrHSV-1 can accommodate variations in genome size up to 5–6% and highlight the importance of maintaining a genome size close to that of the wild-type HSV-1 for enhanced genomic stability and sustained transgene expression without adverse effects. This strategy offers a promising approach for optimizing nrHSV-1 vectors for clinical applications.">

 Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and therapeutically challenging subtype of breast cancer, characterized by significant intra-tumoral heterogeneity and the absence of actionable molecular markers. This study addresses the urgent need for targeted therapies by investigating the role of non-coding regulatory elements, specifically super enhancers (SEs), in TNBC pathogenesis. SEs are large clusters of enhancers with high transcription factor occupancy and enhancer RNA (eRNA) production, regulating key genes involved in cell identity and cancer progression. Using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq) across 13 cancer cell lines, we identified a novel TNBC-specific, transcriptionally active SE on chromosome 17, located upstream of the ITGA3 gene. To elucidate its functional role, we conducted CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) assays coupled with RNA sequencing in TNBC cells, revealing genome-wide SE target genes. Integration with high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data established direct chromatin interactions linking the SE to its target genes, which collectively form a gene signature predictive of poor clinical outcomes. Perturbation of this SE via CRISPR significantly impaired tumor cell proliferation, highlighting its role as a potential driver of oncogenic phenotypes. These findings provide new insights into enhancer-target gene interactions in TNBC and identify this SE and its associated gene network as promising therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="Potassium ions (K+) within the tumor microenvironment, along with dysregulation of K+ channels, play critical roles in supporting cancer cell survival and preventing their elimination. Directly monitoring changes in K+ homeostasis within cancer cells is invaluable for understanding these processes. However, achieving high selectivity over other biological metal ions, a detection dynamic range that aligns with intracellular K+ levels, and broad accessibility to research laboratories remain technically challenging for current K+ imaging probes. In this study, we report the in vitro selection of the first K+-specific RNA-cleaving DNAzyme and the development of a K+-specific DNAzyme fluorescent sensor with exceptional selectivity, achieving over 1000-fold selectivity against Na+ and more than 100-fold selectivity over other major biologically relevant metal ions. This sensor has an apparent dissociation constant (105 mM) that is close to the intracellular level of K+, and it has a broad detection range from 21 to 200 mM K+. Using this tool, we reveal a progressive decline in intracellular K+ levels in breast cancer cells with more advanced progression states. Moreover, we demonstrate that elevated extracellular K+ levels interfere with the efficacy of anticancer compounds like ML133 and Amiodarone, suggesting an underappreciated role of microenvironmental K+ in chemoresistance. Notably, blocking the Kir2.1 channel activity restored treatment sensitivity, presenting a potential strategy to overcome chemoresistance in aggressive cancers. These findings underscore the role of K+ homeostasis in tumor progression and support further exploration of ion-channel-targeted cancer therapies.">

 The current standard of care for glioblastoma (GBM) is surgical intervention followed by a combination of temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy. Only 5% GBM patients survive more than five years despite aggressive therapeutic treatment. A significant hurdle to develop target-based therapies for GBM is the complexity and diversity of the disease. Genomic and epigenetic profiling has found a broad range mutational and transcriptional events across this histologically diverse disease. A hallmark of GBM is genomic instability, which is a key factor in its progression and complexity. The fast growing and aggressive GBM cells demand rapid DNA replication and hypertranscription, leading to enhanced transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs). A major source of genomic instability, TCR causes lethal double stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) if not resolved properly. We hypothesize that enhanced TRC is a weak link and a promising target for treating GBM.
 Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a key component of DNA replication machinery and plays an essential role in the DNA replication and repair. Through a rational drug design, we identified a small molecule PCNA inhibitor, AOH1996, which selectively kills cancer cells. Mechanistically, AOH1996 enhances the interaction between PCNA and the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, RPB1, and dissociates PCNA from actively transcribed chromatin regions. By interfering with TRC resolution as evidenced by induction of R-loop levels in cancer cells, AOH1996 induces DSBs in a transcription-dependent manner. Orally administrable and metabolically stable, AOH1996 can freely pass the blood brain barrier and enter brain tumors. Here, we report that it selectively kills GBM cells as a monotherapy or in combination with TMZ but causes no discernable side effects. Importantly, AOH1996 targets a cancer specific region of PCNA that is a highly conserved through evolution and influences the activity of broad cellular processes that are essential to the growth and survival of cancer cells. GBM cancer cells are, therefore, less likely to develop resistance to AOH1996 through mutagenesis in PCNA. If combined with the existing chemotherapeutic regime and inhibitors of DNA repair pathways, AOH1996 may provide a new and unique therapeutic avenue for exploiting this cancer-selective vulnerability to deliver a durable response in GBM.

 Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide, largely due to the high risk of recurrence and metastasis in HER2-negative and hormone receptor-negative triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. While bone metastasis is common, the molecular mechanisms driving its initiation remain poorly understood. We recently identified a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) with ancestral features, marked by the FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 3 (FXYD3), a Na+/K+ pump component. These “ancestor-like CSCs” persist in breast tissues during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), linking them to drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs) and positioning them as critical therapeutic targets for preventing local recurrence (Li M, Gotoh N et al., J Clin Invest, 2023). Despite this, the mechanisms underlying DTP dormancy in the bone marrow and their transformation into bone metastasis-initiating cells remain unclear. Given the stromal richness of TNBC tissues, we explored interactions between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and breast cancer cells using a co-culture system. Single-cell analysis revealed a strong upregulation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) in co-cultured CAFs. Notably, we identified FXYD3+ and GCSF receptor-positive cancer cells as a distinct subpopulation of CSCs with bone metastasis initiation potential. To investigate the temporal-spatial dynamics of bone metastasis initiation, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (10x Genomics) and multiplex immunofluorescent imaging (PhenoCycler) using metastatic bone marrow from the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. These analyses revealed how bone metastasis-initiating CSCs exploit the plasticity of bone marrow cells—particularly hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells—to establish a CSC niche at the single-cell level. Our findings provide critical insights into the mechanisms of recurrence and metastasis in breast cancer, offering novel therapeutic opportunities to target ancestor-like CSCs and prevent disease progression.

 Due to the lack of molecular-targeted therapies for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), there have been efforts to use multimodal strategies to enhance the efficacy of existing therapies such as radiation. The androgen receptor (AR) has been identified as a radiosensitizing target and is expressed in 25-50% of TNBC tumors. The combination of AR inhibitors, such as enzalutamide (enza), and radiation therapy (RT), leads to radiosensitization in AR+ TNBC models but the mechanism by which AR mediates radioresistance is not known, and targeting this radioresistance could provide a novel strategy to improve outcomes in this aggressive breast cancer subtype. Following RT, AR is translocated to the nucleus suggesting that AR may drive transcriptional changes in response to RT.



 Bulk RNA-seq with and without R1881 stimulation and RT was used to assess transcriptional changes at 24 hours. RPPA analysis evaluated protein and phophoprotein changes. AR ChIP-seq was used to identify changes in AR binding and Bru-seq to profile changes in nascent RNA. These experiments were performed in two AR+ TNBC models, MDA-MB-453 and MFM-223 cells, with and without enza and RT. Clonogenic survival assays were performed to assess for radiosensitivity.



 RNA-seq and RPPA analysis demonstrated numerous changes in gene and protein expression after enza-, RT-, and combination treatment. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of these changes nominated alterations of MAPK pathway genes with R1881 and R1881+RT compared to controls. To assess the MAPK/ERK pathway, constitutively active ERK was overexpressed in AR+ TNBC models which induced radioresistance, confirming this relationship. As expected, AR ChIP-seq data showed enza treatment induced a significant reduction in AR peaks compared to DMSO-treated controls. Radiation induced fewer changes in AR binding than enza treatment. Bru-seq GSEA showed significant upregulation of MYC target gene sets in response to RT in control conditions. Conversely, with enza treatment, there was no significant MYC target gene set upregulation. While there were no changes in MYC expression or AR binding to known MYC enhancers, there was increased binding of AR to known MYC binding sites in control samples in response to RT. This RT-induced binding to MYC sites was not seen in the enza-treated samples suggesting that AR inhibition may dampen the RT induction of MYC signaling leading to radiosensitization.



 These findings provide new insights into the molecular underpinnings of AR-mediated radioresistance and identify MAPK and MYC pathways as potential therapeutic targets to enhance radiosensitivity in AR+ TNBC. Ongoing studies aim to translate these findings into clinically actionable strategies. This work expands our understanding of AR-mediated radioresistance which may uncover resistance mechanisms to combination AR inhibition and RT.

        <tr id="The adaptive response of cancer cells to hypoxia, a key microenvironmental factor in solid tumors, is intricately orchestrated by Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1). Evidence is accumulating on oxygen dynamics in tumor cores, showing that hypoxia is frequently unstable, or cycling, associated with specific phenotypic outcomes for the cancer. Transcriptomic analysis show that most gene expression changes in cycling hypoxia lie in between the change caused by stable hypoxia, suggesting multi-cycle averaging of dosage in the oxygen tension, and likely HIF-1 induced transcription. However, small subset of genes show an oscillation/cycling hypoxia specific response, suggesting that the transcriptional machinery of these genes may interpret cycling HIF-1 activity differently from stably high HIF-1 activity. Here, we model a gene regulatory circuit, the incoherent feed-forward loops (IFFLs) to explore parameter regimes where oscillatory specific transcription is plausible. In these IFFL models, HIF-1 regulates gene transcription of a target gene directly, as well indirectly via another transcription factor with an opposite effect on gene transcription. We have identified several plausible parameter regimes where oscillation specific gene expression can occur, with potentially significant effect on cancer growth and progression. Finally, we experimentally confirmed that HIF-1 can form IFFLs with two key transcription factors p53, and Notch1, resulting in cycling hypoxia specific gene expression linked to breast cancer progression and poor prognosis. Our models mechanistically reveal how temporal fluctuations in the tumor microenvironment may directly inform downstream transcription, identify hitherto unknown HIF-1 driven mechanism of cancer progression contributing to emergent tumor heterogeneity.">

 KRAS-G12C inhibitors are promising in targeted therapeutic strategies. However, it remains uncertain to search for biological reminders of clinical outcomes and early resistance.



 Systematic review has been performed up to September, 2024 to evaluate treatment efficacy and beneficial patients. We constructed KEAP1 and STK11 knockout mutants with CRISPR/Cas9 technology and PD-L1 overexpression mutants with lentiviral vectors. The sensitivity of cells to different KRAS-G12C inhibitors was assessed using CCK-8 assays. Potential pathways of resistance were identified through comprehensive bioinformatics analyses.



 13 clinical trials with 1, 132 enrolled patients indicated remarkable clinical efficacy and benefit the senior and the female. Patients with liver and brain metastases also tends to benefit from KRAS-G12C inhibitors. KEAP1 mutation serves as a critical negative biomarker for early progression and resistance. Validation studies indicated a notable increase in IC50 values for different KRAS-G12C inhibitors after KEAP1 knockout (P < 0.0001). Differentially expressed genes in KEAP1 knockout cells versus contrast groups were conducted with GO, KEGG, and Reactome pathway analyses, suggested evident enrichment in extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion processes. In addition, STK11 mutations and an increasing PD-L1 expression level reminds of worse prognosis, despite absence of significant difference.



 This research considered KRAS-G12C inhibitors as optional therapy and selected some subgroups who are more likely gain benefits from targeted therapy. As a key adverse biomarker, KEAP1 mutation tends to affect extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion and promotes early resistance.

 The emerging field of comparative oncology may provide a novel solution to rare human cancer studies, as genomic resources, reference genomes, and non-human model cancer sequencing data are proliferating rapidly. Studying cancer across a diverse array of species provides a unique opportunity to interrogate factors underpinning cancer, facilitating disease modeling in the setting of spontaneous tumors complicated by comorbidities and metastases. Unfortunately, spontaneously developed tumors in non-human mammalian models have been largely overlooked, leaving a foundational resource underutilized. Several key barriers prevent the adoption of these critical data. Extensive reporting of the frequency and diversity of animal tumors has not been systematically linked to the plethora of genomic resources available. Additionally, complications in integrating data from hundreds of genomes have prevented large-scale analysis. Fortunately, recent advances in comparative genomics allowing for joint alignments of hundreds of species have bridged this gap, enabling us to integrate the rapidly expanding genetic resources for non-traditional model species and presenting an enormous potential resource for oncology.
 To facilitate the transition of comparative oncology studies from human plus one or two other species to pan-mammalian analyses, we developed the Paipu computational pipeline to systematically identify and process data from hundreds of mammalian species, creating a pan-mammalian tumor compendium. Paipu consists of three phases: reference genome preparation, SRA metadata retrieval and harmonization, and FREYA for RNA-seq data processing and harmonization. Paipu identified and harmonized data from over 100, 000 non-human mammalian cancer RNA-seq samples from NCBI, spanning 52 of the 241 mammalian species in the Zoonomia multi-species genome alignment. We demonstrate Paipu’s potential via a comparative analysis of human cancers and a rapidly emerging model system, the dog. Using the Paipu cancer data compendium, we analyzed ten cancers in human and dog. We identified a subset of the cancers as strong models of human cancer, which we validated through literature analysis. Additionally, our comparative cancer analysis results parallel the original TCGA pan-cancer analysis findings.
 Paipu’s harmonization of data from numerous mammalian species facilitates downstream comparative genomics analysis. Increasing the diversity of genomes used in comparative studies can reveal shared and lineage-specific variation across species, leading to the identification of novel mechanisms of cancer risks and resistance. Our approach provides a unique opportunity to harness significant advances in the rapidly developing fields of machine learning and genomics for human cancer research by identifying reciprocal links between evolution and cancer resistance.

 In cancer research, perturbing gene function is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing treatments. Techniques such as RNA interference and CRISPR-knockout, -interference, or -activation are commonly used. In this recent study we compared the phenotypic effects of cellular morphology by knocking out or knocking down key cell cycle regulators, Aurora kinase B (AURKB), Geminin (GMNN), and Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which are known key critical proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, and their dysfunction linked to cancer progression. In this in vitro osteosarcoma cell line (U 2-OS) model, we inhibited these proteins using CRISPR-Cas9 for gene knockout or siRNA for mRNA knockdown in a comparative study not previous reported. Employing Cell Painting methodology (6 fluorescent probes, high content screening (HCS) confocal imaging, and multivariant analysis) we imaged and profiled the morphological phenotypes following gene perturbations. Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis of hundreds of HCS image phenotypic feature measurements revealed significant morphological changes and reduced cell numbers from AURKB, GMNN, and PLK1 inhibition in U 2-OS cells caused significant phenotypic changes and reduced cell numbers suggesting alteration of cell cycle progression. Interestingly, in the GMNN inhibition, the siRNA-treated cells showed a higher percentage of large nuclei compared to small nuclei from CRISPR-treated cells. These findings suggest siRNA-mediated knockdown has a faster inhibitory effect on GMNN than CRISPR-treated conditions. This study demonstrates the complementary nature of CRISPR-Cas9 and siRNA gene modulation and underscores the importance of orthogonal validation for robust genetic studies with key cell cycle regulators.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease showing significant variability in clinical aggressiveness and treatment response. Primary and acquired resistance limit the efficacy of available treatments, and identification of new therapeutic targets is needed to further improve patients’ outcomes. To identify actionable targets, we performed a “drop-out” loss-of-function screening with an shRNA library covering 200 drug-target genes in nine different CRC cell lines, covering the whole spectrum of molecular subtypes of CRC. Multiple screening hits were found. Among them RRM1, encoding a member of the ribonucleotide reductase complex and targeted by the FDA-approved drug clofarabine, was found to be non-dispensable in all cell lines. In vitro drug efficacy studies confirmed sensitivity to clofarabine of most CRC cell lines. In vivo testing on a CRC cell line xenograft confirmed substantial growth inhibition by clofarabine. These results unveil a possible therapeutic opportunity in colorectal cancer.

 Cancer heterogeneity poses a significant medical challenge, necessitating therapies tailored not only to individual patients but also to the unique cancer clones that exist within diverse microenvironmental contexts. Despite this diversity, nearly all cancer cells share a reliance on telomeres to maintain genomic stability. The telomerase (hTERT) gene is hyperactive in many cancers and has been identified as a potential target for treatment. While this has led to the development of multiple telomerase-targeting approaches, disappointingly, none have been approved in clinical applications yet. To circumvent this concern, our team has applied a genetic approach called synthetic dosage lethality (SDL), to exploit hTERT overexpression to identify potential targets to treat cancer. SDL is a genetic concept, where a normally non-lethal gene inactivation kills cells only in the context of overexpression of another gene like hTERT. Our laboratories have used lentiviral-based pooled CRISPR/Cas9 and pooled shRNA-screening platforms to systematically query the genome and recently identified several SDL partners of hTERT. Through extensive validation using pooled in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screens across multiple cell lines, tumor xenografts, and patient-derived organoids, we identified RMT1, an RNA 2'-O-methyltransferase, as a prominent SDL partner of hTERT. In collaboration with the AtomWise and Thoth Biosimulations companies, we have developed novel inhibitors for RMT1 that preferentially suppress hTERT-overexpressing cell lines growth and viability. We have also performed a large-scale screen of FDA-approved small molecule inhibitors with the goal of repurposing these drugs to target hTERT-overexpressing cancers. Subsequently, we plan to apply these therapies in combination to amplify the efficiency of treatment against cancers, yielding preclinical evidence to support the development of novel cancer therapies. Since hTERT activity is essential in all cancer cells, our findings introduce a transformative approach to overcoming cancer cell heterogeneity by targeting the SDL interactions of hTERT. This strategy also capitalizes on the ubiquitous overexpression of hTERT in all cancer types, enabling the selective eradication of hTERT-dependent malignancies.

        <tr id="Genotoxic stress-induced stem cell maldifferentiation (GSMD) integrates DNA damage responses with loss of stemness and lineage-specific differentiation to prevent damaged stem cell propagation. However, molecular mechanisms governing GSMD remain unclear. Here, we identify the p53-induced long non-coding RNA LOC644656 as a key regulator of GSMD in human embryonic stem cells. LOC644656 accumulates in the nucleus upon DNA damage, disrupting pluripotency by interacting directly with POU5F1 and KDM1A/LSD1-NuRD complexes, repressing stemness genes, and activating TGF-β signaling. Additionally, LOC644656 mitigates DNA damage by binding DNA-PKcs and modulating the DNA damage response. In cancer, elevated LOC644656 correlates with poor patient survival and enhanced chemoresistance. Our findings demonstrate that LOC644656 mediates stemness suppression and resistance to genotoxic stress by coordinating DNA damage signaling and differentiation pathways. Thus, LOC644656 represents a potential therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance and advancing stem cell biology.">

 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most lethal form of lung cancer. This poor prognosis is due in large part to SCLC’s recalcitrance to therapy. The standard of care for extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) is chemotherapy with immunotherapy. While most tumors initially respond, responses are transient and >80% of tumors progress within one year of treatment. Seminal studies have shown that sequencing aggressive tumors before and after therapy identifies drivers of resistance. Unfortunately, the aggressive clinical course of ES-SCLC has precluded collection of patient-matched naïve and recurrent tumor tissue traditionally required to study evolution. In lieu of this, other groups have used circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to study SCLC evolution. However, these studies used sequencing panels that analyze <0.004% of the SCLC genome. Using new methods to comprehensively trace how SCLCs evolve to therapy resistance is a significant unmet need.



 Medical records were reviewed to identify treatment naïve ES-SCLC patients with longitudinal liquid biopsies collected pre- and post-therapy using IRB-approved protocols. ctDNA was isolated from plasma using NucleoSnap cfDNA kits. Germline DNA was extracted from buffy coats using NucleoSpin Blood kits. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) libraries were prepared using Twist cfDNA Library Preparation with UMI Adapter kits. Deep WGS of ctDNA (>100X) and germline DNA (>40X) was performed using an Illumina NovaSeqX sequencer. Reads were aligned to the hg38 reference genome with BWA-mem. Somatic mutations were called using a two-of-three consensus approach and Mutect2, Strelka2, and MuSE. Structural variants were called using a consensus approach with GRIDSS, SvABA, and Manta. Subclonal copy number alterations were identified with Battenberg. Pyclone was used to reconstruct clonal populations.



 As expected, we identified deleterious genomic alterations impacting TP53 and RB1 tumor suppressor genes, known drivers of SCLC development. COSMIC mutational signature analysis identified high activity of tobacco carcinogen, APOBEC, and replicative-based processes across tumors. We found highly varied patterns of genomic evolution following frontline chemoimmunotherapy across patients. Most ES-SCLC tumors exhibited genomic evolution at recurrence, with evidence of focal amplifications and deletions or whole genome duplication. Some tumors exhibited minimal copy number evolution at relapse, suggesting non-genomic mechanisms driving resistance. We also found that second line therapies forced additional genomic evolution following initial recurrence.



 Our data demonstrates that deep WGS of ctDNA recapitulates known genetics of ES-SCLC and enables sensitive characterization of resistant clones. Our data highlights the under-appreciated role of genomic evolution in ES-SCLC frontline therapy resistance.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) can be divided into 2 genetically different subtypes: Microsatellite instable CRC (MSI-CRC; ∼15% of CRC), and microsatellite stable (MSS-CRC; ∼85%). While MSI-CRC develops point mutations that increase neoantigen burden and enhanced response to immunotherapy, MSS-CRC develops chromosomal instability (CIN) and resistance to immunotherapy. Current mouse models do not recapitulate the key genetic defect of MSS-CRC: CIN. This limits our understanding of CIN‘s role in regulating tumor immunity in CRC, and therefore our capacity to generate new immunotherapies for MSS-CRC.
 To address this gap, we developed the first genetically engineered mouse model of MSS-CRC with human-like CIN. To recapitulate human CIN caused by telomere erosion, we incorporated the conditional null Apc and Trp53, and inducible Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL) mouse telomerase reverse transcriptase (mTert) alleles, referred to as iTAP. Due to LSL-mTert, mice lack mTert expression and therefore telomerase activity, which leads to telomere erosion upon successive generational intercrosses, evolving from G0 mice (LSL-mTert+/-) that have no CIN (CIN- iTAP) to G3 mice after 3 breeding generations with the mTert+/+ allele that develop CIN (CIN+ iTAP). Colonoscopy-guided submucosal administration of 4-OHT activates Villin-driven Cre-ER in colonocytes leading to Apc and Trp53 deletion and deletion of the stop cassette of LSL-mTert causing activation of telomerase in cancer cells. Oncogenesis in cells with telomere erosion leads to CIN.
 Consistent with worse OS in human MSS CINhigh, CIN+ iTAP tumors were more aggressive than CIN- iTAP. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) confirmed that CIN+ iTAP tumors developed more copy number variations. Subclustering of the infiltrating immune populations revealed that γδ T cells expanded and changed their phenotype in CIN+ iTAP tumors, which was confirmed by flow cytometry. Treatment with a blocking antibody towards γδ TCR in mice with established tumors lead to increased survival in CIN+ iTAP mice but not in CIN- iTAP mice. ScRNA-seq of primary tumors of patients with MSS-CRC revealed that γδ T cells also exhibit phenotypic changes upon different levels of CIN in human MSS CRC.

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common cancer worldwide, often shows limited responsiveness to immunotherapy due to its predominantly immune-excluded phenotype. Despite increasing insights into the complex tumor microenvironment (TME), the metabolic heterogeneity of CRC cells and their interactions with tumor-infiltrating immune cells remain poorly understood.We analyzed 46,374 epithelial cells from 17 CRC patients treated with PD-1 blockade to develop an amino acid (AA) metabolism score using the AUCell algorithm. This score was applied to a separate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset from 23 CRC patients to investigate cell-cell interactions and functions of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, revealing distinct immune TME landscapes shaped by tumor metabolism. An in vitro co-culture assay of CRC cells and CD8+ T cells was performed to validate the findings. Additionally, LASSO and Cox regression analyses were conducted to construct an AA metabolism-related risk score for predicting prognosis and drug sensitivity across multiple bulk transcriptome cohorts.This study identified a link between elevated amino acid metabolism in CRC epithelial cells and resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy. A 31-gene AA score was developed by intersecting differentially expressed genes between responders and non-responders to PD-1 blockade with amino acid metabolism-related genes from the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB). Using this score, 23 additional CRC samples were classified into high and low AA score groups. Comparative analysis revealed that the low AA group exhibited a more robust immune response, characterized by a greater number and stronger cell-cell interactions. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells in this group demonstrated enhanced activation and anti-tumor functions. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells showed increased Granzyme B levels when co-cultured with CRC cells in which Psat1 or Shmt2 was knocked down. Finally, a machine learning-derived risk score based on six genes was established to translate single-cell findings to bulk transcriptomes. This risk score was found to correlate with immune checkpoint expression and immune cell infiltration, with potential implications for predicting prognosis and drug sensitivity.Our findings highlight the role of elevated epithelial amino acid metabolism in shaping an immune-suppressive microenvironment, offering insights for patient stratification and therapeutic decision-making.">

 Chromosomal instability (CIN), characterized by frequent chromosomal alterations, plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis, significantly influencing cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. Targeting vulnerabilities associated with CIN, particularly in DNA repair pathways, presents promising therapeutic strategies. However, existing CIN detection methods are often costly and labor-intensive. Thus, the development of efficient and cost-effective CIN detection panels is essential for optimizing cancer treatments and enhancing patient outcomes while reducing healthcare costs.



 We conducted a retrospective study analyzing 4, 941 tissue samples from patients diagnosed with 14 distinct cancer types, including ovarian, uterine, breast, pancreatic, prostate, cervical, liver, lung, colorectal, and gastric cancers. A targeted sequencing panel, GENESEEQ GENAVISTA, assessing 437 cancer-associated genes with an approximate depth of coverage of 1, 000X, facilitated detailed mutational profiling. CIN assessment utilized read depth and allele frequency evaluation, alongside variant calling algorithms to identify gene duplications and genomic rearrangements. Additionally, a prospective cohort of 33 cancer patients was analyzed to compare the efficacy of our sequencing panel against the gold standard of whole genome sequencing (WGS, ∼30X).



 Our analysis revealed significant CIN prevalence across various cancer types, particularly elevated in ovarian cancer (73.26%) and breast cancer (76.80%). Lung cancer exhibited a CIN rate of 78.57%, while melanoma demonstrated an 80.00% prevalence. Endometrial cancer presented a moderate CIN rate of 40.62%, whereas pancreatic cancer displayed an equal distribution between CIN and genomically stable tumors, each accounting for 50.00%. Prostate cancer showed a CIN incidence of 45.16%, and cervical cancer recorded a rate of 62.30%. The findings illustrate the heterogeneous nature of CIN among malignancies, suggesting its utility as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target. The panel demonstrated a high correlation with WGS results in the prospective cohort (Spearman rank correlation = 0.91), confirming its effectiveness in identifying CINs in cancer patients.



 Our study establishes the GENESEEQ GENAVISTA targeted sequencing panel as an effective tool for accurately detecting CIN across various cancer types. The strong correlation with whole genome sequencing highlights its potential as a reliable, cost-effective alternative for CIN assessment, facilitating optimized cancer treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes while minimizing healthcare costs.

 Chromatin dysregulation has been implicated in the development of a wide range of diseases, including cancer, as well as therapeutic resistance. Genetic alterations in chromatin regulatory factors and aberrant activity of transcriptional regulators alter chromatin states and drive tumor growth in cancer. One example of a cancer that is driven by alterations in chromatin landscape is Ewing sarcoma, a highly aggressive pediatric cancer of bones and soft tissues. Ewing sarcoma is driven by an oncoprotein generated by the translocation of the EWSR1 and FLI1 genes, resulting in the fusion oncoprotein (EWSR1::FLI1), which activates noncanonical enhancers and alters the expression of critical genes associated with the disease. EWSR1::FL1 is challenging, if not impossible, to target directly with small molecules, and viable therapeutic targets for Ewing sarcoma have been slow to emerge. To broaden the search for druggable targets we developed a target agnostic screening approach that exploits oncoprotein-specific chromatin accessibility states as a relevant and direct functional readout for identifying novel therapeutics. We developed and optimized a 384-well, high throughput (HT) version of the Assay for Transpose-Accessible Chromatin assay (HT-ATAC-seq) that was applied to 500 EWSR1::FLI1-regulated chromatin regions. Using Ewing sarcoma-derived A673 cells, we conducted a pilot screen of 12,000 small-molecule compounds comprising approved drugs, investigational agents, and bioactive compounds. The screen identified 285 compounds that partially reversed Ewing sarcoma chromatin abnormalities. The set of active compounds included Panobinostat, which is currently in preclinical development for Ewing sarcoma. This pilot screen supports the HT-ATAC-seq assay as a robust approach to identify novel compounds that reverse the chromatin alterations associated with Ewing sarcoma. This approach and assay can be adapted to investigate other cancers or pathologies associated with chromatin state alterations.

 Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer where the acquisition of numerous genetic alterations leads to transformation and carcinogenesis. These alterations result in the generation of potentially immunogenic neoantigens, and the clinical success of checkpoint inhibitor therapies has highlighted the importance of neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy. Evaluation of the next generation of neoantigen therapies is complicated by the difficulty in sourcing primary patient material. During tumor resection and pathology review, the tissue is fixed, which prevents the ability to test in vitro model systems for therapy efficacy. While fresh tissue is amendable to in vitro culture, it is not possible to perform large scale genomic and proteomic screens in a timeframe for the culture to occur. By leveraging viably cryopreserved dissociated tissue, the tumor can be analyzed for genetic alterations and then, when novel neoantigens are determined, cultured at a later date. To test this workflow, we profiled dissociated tissues from cancer indications with a high degree of genomic instability for microsatellite instability (MSI). Consistent with previous studies, 17-55% of endometrial, colorectal, and gastric cancer samples were MSI-high. MSI-high and microsatellite stable (MSS) samples were further analyzed for peptide identification using LC-MS/MS (Orbitrap Astral) and over 10,000 protein groups and 80,000 peptides were identified. Samples were also amendable to T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing to uncover tumor-reactive T cell clones. These deep molecular analyses provided the foundation for the development of short-term spheroid and long-term tumoroid culture systems to understand immune responses using autologous tumor-infiltrating and peripheral lymphocytes. Collectively, this workflow provides a scalable system to identify neoantigens and evaluate the immune response to these antigens in a robust and reproducible pipeline.

 Background:
 HRDsig can aid in identifying tumors with DNA repair deficiencies, guiding PARP inhibitor (PARPi) use. It expands treatment options beyond breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutations enabling personalized therapy. Combining PARPi with targeted therapy or immunotherapy shows promise in overcoming resistance and improving outcomes for treatment-resistant ACM.
 Methods:
 Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumors and metastatic biopsies from 9,576 ACM cases were analyzed using hybrid capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP), evaluating all classes of genomic alterations (GA). Central pathology review was conducted for all cases. Microsatellite instability-high (MSIH) status, tumor mutational burden (TMB), genomic ancestry, and mutational signatures were derived from sequencing data. HRDsig was assessed using copy number changes and genomic scars. PD-L1 expression was determined via immunohistochemistry [Dako 22C3; tumor proportion score (TPS)]. Statistical comparisons were made using Fisher’s exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction.
 Results:
 Among 9,576 ACM cases, 198 (2.1%) were HRDsig positive (HRDsig+). HRDsig+ cases when compared to HRDsig negative (HRDsig-) were older (median age: 69 vs. 67 years; p=0.034), more often female (49.5% vs. 36.2%; p=0.001), and had more GA per tumor (median: 7 vs. 6; p=0.026). HRDsig+ cases were more often of African (5.6% vs. 1.2%; p<0.0001) or American ancestry (8.1% vs. 4.1%; p=0.026) and less often European (84.3% vs. 94.0%; p<0.0001). GA more common in HRDsig+ included
 IGF1R
 (5.1% vs. 1.3%; p=0.003),
 KIT
 (11.6% vs. 5.6%; p=0.004),
 KRAS
 (7.1% vs. 2.7%; p=0.005),
 NF1
 (38.4% vs. 21.4%; p<0.0001),
 RAD21
 (6.7% vs. 3.0%; p=0.037), and
 TP53
 (40.4% vs. 24.3%; p<0.0001). HRDsig- cases exhibited higher TMB (median: 13.8 vs. 6.1; p<0.0001), more frequent TMB >10 mutations/Mb (60.9% vs. 39.9%; p<0.0001), and more UV light exposure trinucleotide signatures (57.3% vs. 36.4%; p<0.0001). GA more common in HRDsig- cases included
 BRAF
 (including V600E) (44.6% vs. 23.2%; p<0.0001),
 CDKN2A
 (49.2% vs. 36.9%; p=0.003),
 NRAS
 (28.0% vs. 11.6%; p<0.0001), and
 TERT
 (74.4% vs. 29.8%; p<0.0001). In both positive and negative groups, PD-L1 low-level expression (1-49% TPS) was comparable (43.3%-39.7%), while BRCA1/2 alterations (<2.0%) and MSIH status (0.0%-0.1%) remained rare.
 Conclusions:
 HRDsig+ status is rare in ACM but more frequent in non-white genomic ancestries. HRDsig+ ACM cases are less likely to have BRAF GA, more likely to have KIT GA and lower TMB levels. These findings may guide the future development of clinical trials employing combination therapies and PARPi in ACM.

 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic data from over 10,000 cancer patients, along with metadata including viral infection status and survival information. We investigated the role of viral infections in dysregulating the expression of A3 enzymes (A3A/B/C/D/F/G/H). These enzymes primarily function to restrict viral infections by introducing C-to-U mutations in viral genomes. However, certain members (notably A3A and A3B) can also mutate cellular DNA, contributing to tumor initiation and progression. Cancers such as breast, bladder, cervical, head & neck, and skin exhibit characteristic C-to-T mutations attributed to the aberrant expression/activity of A3 enzymes. Accurate quantification of A3 dysregulation in tumor cells using TCGA bulk RNAseq data is complicated by the ubiquitous expression of these enzymes in infiltrating immune cells. This highlights a broader challenge in analyzing heterogeneous tumor biopsies to uncover virus-specific dysregulated processes in cancer. To address this challenge, we employed Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to deconvolute A3 expression profiles from TCGA bulk RNA-seq data, i.e. to separate tumor cell profiles from those of the tumor microenvironment. We validated our NMF-extracted profiles by analyzing publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets from approximately 3,000 cancer projects in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Additionally, to identify cell types represented by these profiles, we compared them with experimentally obtained A3 expressions from purified cell types. Our analyses identified up to four distinct A3 profiles: two associated with T cells and NK cells, one linked to dendritic cells and macrophages, and one corresponding to cancerous epithelial cells. Notably, the A3 profiles derived from our analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data closely matched those deconvoluted from TCGA bulk RNA-seq data, demonstrating that our bulk RNA-seq deconvolution effectively captures single-cell population-level profiles. We found that both tumor-specific and immune cell-specific A3 profiles correlate with viral infection; however, significant variations were observed across different viral types and tumor types. None of these profiles were correlated with the extent of A3 mutational signatures SBS2 and SBS13.In conclusion, our study demonstrates that deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq datasets can reveal single-cell population-level insights into the cellular composition of tumor biopsies. Moreover, this approach offers the resolution needed to pinpoint virus-specific dysregulated processes within the complex and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment.

        <tr id="Since its advent about ten years ago, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been frequently used in biomedical applications. It has advanced various fields, and CRISPR-Cas9-based therapeutics have shown promising results in the treatment of specific hematological diseases. Furthermore, CRISPR gene editing technologies have revolutionized cancer research by enabling a broad range of genetic perturbations, including genetic knockouts and precise single nucleotide changes. This perspective focuses on the state-of-the-art methodology of CRISPR knock-ins to engineer immune cells. Since this technique relies on homology-directed repair (HDR) of double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by the Cas9 enzyme, it can be used to introduce specific mutations into the target genome. Therefore, this methodology offers a valuable opportunity to functionally study specific mutations and to uncover their impacts not only on overall cell functions but also on the mechanisms behind cancer-related alterations in common signaling pathways.

 Novel therapeutic protocols are desperately needed to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the deadliest cancer world-wide. Recently, utilizing a patient’s tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is proving to be a viable and highly personalized approach. Despite its promise, many obstacles remain, such as refining expansion protocols for better in vivo TIL proliferative potential, improving T cell ability for homing-to and targeting tumor cells upon re-infusion, and avoiding IL-2/lymphodepletion related side effects. We hypothesize that inhibiting epigenetic enzyme EZH2 (EZH2i) will improve both TIL expansion and infusion outcomes in NSCLC patients. Yet, there are likely mechanisms of T cell suppression that EZH2i may not overcome. To address and identify these mechanisms, stochastic mathematical modeling of gene signaling in cancer has risen as a useful tool. Thus, we further hypothesize that modern sequencing data and mathematical biology can discover alternative mechanisms of T cell suppression that will suggest novel targets for TIL-combination treatment.
 To test these hypotheses, we have tested the EZH2 inhibitor valemetostat with anti-PD1 in a murine model of non-small cell lung cancer. We observed tumor regression and strong IFN-gamma T cell responses in combination treated animals. We also observed up-regulation of both major histocompatibility complexes, greater pro-T cell cytokine signaling, and myeloid populations became more tumor-eliminating. To translate these findings to TILs, we are currently securing NSCLC samples from our Biospecimen Core, establishing patient-derived tumoroids, and expanding TILs ex vivo. TILs will be expanded with/without EZH2 inhibitor valemetostat (Val) under “young” protocols. At ex vivo endpoint TILs will be assessed for Val-driven differences in viability, differentiation state, and reactivity via flow cytometry. To complement or studies with an in silico approach, we are utilizing libraries of publicly available NSCLC data to perform bioinformatic analysis and implemented equation learning techniques to infer NSCLC tumor signaling networks from clinical data between immunotherapy responders and non-responders. Differentiation patterns will be assessed as a function of pseudo-time-course data to inform predictions of signal transduction pathways. Lastly, mathematical phenotype control theory will be used to uncover potential targets within the tumor to boost TIL response in NSCLC.
 Given that advanced stage lung cancers remains refractory to most treatments, determining methods to improve precision medicine options such as TIL therapy is an important goal for the field. Our blending of classic bench science with bio-informatics has the potential to deepen our understanding of TIL therapy and to identify new way to improve therapeutic responses.

        <tr id="The peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are the only disease for which four histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been approved globally as single agents. Although it is not clear why the PTCL exhibit such a vulnerability to these drugs, understanding the biological basis for this activity is essential. Many lines of data have established that the PTCL exhibit marked sensitivity to other epigenetically targeted drugs, including EZH2 and DNMT3 (DNA-methyltransferase 3) inhibitors. Even more compelling is the finding that combinations of drugs targeting the epigenetic biology of PTCL are beginning to produce provocative data, leading some to wonder if these agents can replace historical chemotherapy regimens routinely used for patients with the disease. Simultaneously, the field has identified a spectrum of mutations in genes governing epigenetic biology in many subtypes of PTCL, although the T follicular helper lymphomas, including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, appear to be particularly enriched for these genetic features. While the direct relationship between the presence of any one of these mutations and responsiveness to a particular epigenetic drug has yet to be established, it is increasingly accepted that the PTCL may be the prototypical epigenetic disease as no other form of cancer has exhibited such a vulnerability to this diversity of epigenetically targeted agents. Herein, we comprehensively review this esoteric and rapidly evolving field to identify themes and lessons from these experiences that may guide efforts to improve outcomes of patients with T-cell neoplasms. Furthermore, we will discuss how these concepts might be applied to the broader field of cancer medicine.">

 Platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs induce intra- and interstrand purine crosslinks causing DNA damage and tumor cell death. Although these drugs are widely used as front-line treatment for multiple human cancers, particularly high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), platinum resistance and tumor recurrence remains a common clinical problem. Here we report results from both a genome-wide CRISPRi screen and an RNA-binding protein-focused CRISPRi screen for modulators of sensitivity and resistance of HGSOC cells to two widely used platinum agents, cisplatin and oxaliplatin, and an microtubule-targeting taxane. Using an in vitro approach that mimics clinical treatment protocols, we found that cell lethality after cisplatin or oxaliplatin treatment in p53-defective ovarian cancer cells is markedly enhanced by suppressing genes in the Fanconi anemia (FA) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways, but considerably less enhanced by suppressing genes in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, despite the well-established importance of NER in reversing platinum-induced intrastrand crosslinks, particularly for cells in G1. Our findings suggest that cell death induced by platinum-DNA crosslinks results from replication stress, which can be further exacerbated by interference with error-free DNA repair mechanisms known to be particularly active during the S- and G2 phases of the cell cycle. These screens further implicated several known and novel RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) as potent sensitizers of HGSOC to both platinum agents and taxanes, including the RNA-modifying enzyme ADAR1, that catalyzes the deamination of adenosine-to-inosine in RNA, altering mRNA coding potential, modifying RNA structure, and regulating RNA localization. Additionally, ADAR1 has been implicated in controlling the integrated stress response (ISR), a signaling network that allows cells to adapt to changes in environment. These findings suggest that activation of an ADAR1-dependent ISR underlies the resistance of HGSOC cells to both platinum-based agents and anti-microtubule drugs that form the current clinical standard of care for HGSOC treatment.

        <tr id="Next generation cancer models, including organoids, neurospheres and cell lines, are significantly advancing our ability to study individual human tumors in vitro and to develop novel cancer therapeutics in settings that resemble in vivo conditions. However, recent questions have emerged as to the degree to which in vitro models may faithfully represent intra- and inter-patient cell state heterogeneity at the transcriptional level of single cells. The Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI), a global collaboration involving the NCI (NIH), Cancer Research UK, the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the Hubrecht Organoid Technology foundation, has generated a large repertoire of 665 patient-derived models of human cancers, including organoids, neurospheres and conditionally reprogrammed cells, with matching parental tumor and clinical annotations. We conducted a tumor-model fidelity analysis using bulk profiles from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and RNA-seq and confirmed strong cell-state concordance between each model and its parental tumor across most HCMI tumor-model pairs, thus showcasing models’ ability to retain key genetic, transcriptional and epigenetic attributes of their parental tumors. However, our analysis also identified divergent features in a subset (<8%) of models, potentially resulting in a loss of fidelity and challenging their translational use. To identify whether this discordance might be driven by ex vivo adaptations or selective evolutionary pressures from in vitro culture, we profiled a representative subset (n=13 pairs) of glioblastoma (GBM, n=7) and pancreatic cancer (PAAD, n=6) tumor-model pairs using single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq). Analysis of 132,593 nuclei (tumors: 66,054; models: 66,539) identified outlier GBM models undergoing proneural-to-mesenchymal (PTM) transition and highlighted serum culture media as a major associated factor of this process. Additionally, we found that divergences in selected PAAD (72,688 nuclei: tumors: 30,254; models: 42,434) pairs were linked to the complete loss of the rich tumor microenvironment cells in the original tumors and the in vitro expansion of select malignant subpopulations, as identified by network-based analysis of VIPER-inferred protein activity profiles. The observed divergences suggest that in vitro culture conditions can occasionally drive cellular reprogramming and alter phenotypic fidelity, resulting in varying degrees of state-specific transitions. However, the majority of the models (even those classified as outliers) are preserved for state-frequency in cellular subpopulations between tumors and models, and most if not all of the cellular states found in the parental tumor, thus faithfully representing intra-tumor heterogeneity. Taken together, these findings highlight the translational potential of the HCMI model repository and its translational relevance as an invaluable tool to support precision oncology.

        <tr id="Objectives The intestine exhibits high radiosensitivity and is susceptible to damage during radiotherapy for abdominal or pelvic tumors, especially at radiation doses exceeding 5 Gy, which can lead to severe gastrointestinal complications. This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms of DNA repair and immune responses in radiation-induced intestinal injury, with the goal of enhancing radiotherapy efficacy. Methods We employed weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to analyze RNA sequencing data from intestinal tissues collected at various time points following irradiation, as well as from mice with targeted disruption of the NFE2-like bZIP transcription factor 2 (Nrf2) gene and their wild-type counterparts. Results Our analysis revealed enhanced DNA repair capacity and attenuated immune response 3.5 days after irradiation. Histone variants and ribosomal proteins were identified as potential contributors to DNA repair processes. We also constructed a competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) network including genes from both the DNA repair and immune modules and identified Akr1b8, Gsta3, and Nqo1 as radiation-effect genes regulated by Nrf2. Conclusions These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of radiation-induced intestinal injury and suggest potential targets for protecting normal intestinal tissue during radiotherapy. This knowledge may contribute to improved treatment outcomes and enhanced patient well-being.">

        <tr id="Lung TRACERx is a prominent study employing multi-region and longitudinal multi-omics sequencing to unravel the evolutionary trajectories of cancer. While aberrant DNA methylation is described in most cancers, its interplay with genomic alterations and chromatin remodeling in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is less understood. We propose Allosteric Chromatin Activity Transition (AllChAT) as a framework to elucidate epigenetic dosage compensation mechanisms, focusing on essential genes impacted by oncogene-driven DNA methylation changes. The study utilized multi-region sampling from 59 NSCLC patients, encompassing 217 tumor regions and 59 adjacent normal tissue samples. RRBS was performed to profile DNA methylation patterns, with tumor-specific methylation rates determined using the CAMDAC tool. WES was conducted to identify somatic mutations and copy number alterations via ASCAT. Additionally, ChIP-seq for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 was carried out on TRACERx patient-derived cell lines (PDCs) to investigate chromatin state changes associated with epigenetic transitions.We identified oncogenes such as RAC1, EGFR, and CDK4, whose expression scales with amplification and exhibited lower methylation levels in tumour regions where amplified compared to non-amplified tumor regions. We also discovered oncogene-proximal genes under dosage compensation by DNA methylation associated with amplification of CCND1 in LUSC and LUAD, as well as CDK4, KRAS, and GNAS, specifically in LUAD. These dosage-compensated genes were enriched for essential genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation on TRACERx patient derived cell lines (PDCs) from 2 tumors and one normal sample, we observed that oncogenes such as CDKN1B, FGFR1, and JAK2 were co-amplified and associated with chromatin opening and hypomethylation at amplified loci compared to non-amplified loci. Additionally, we found essential passenger genes, including NOP2, DCTN6 and FOXD4, were associated with closed chromatin and increased DNA methylation at the respective loci when amplified compared to when not amplified in tumor PDCs compared to the normal PDC. As observed in TRACERx tumor tissues, we observed evidence for AllChAT around LRRC34 when co-amplified with the PI3KCA oncogene in both tumor PDCs. Conversely, as expected, no evidence of AllChAT was observed in non-amplified control regions such as for the essential passenger genes TOMM40 and RPS9 located proximal to the ERCC2 oncogene when not amplified nor for the essential gene ECT2 located proximal to PIK3CA. Taken together, these data suggest that copy number alterations around amplified oncogenes might trigger an allosteric chromatin transition and DNA hypermethylation of co-amplified passenger genes, which might be crucial to the regulation of essential genes during tumor evolution.

 Our goal is to develop a cell culture model of cancer cells that persist under all challenges including therapies, mostly in quiescence, and evolve further to cause recurrence. The rationale for the choice of model as cell culture is that it is ideal of evaluating therapeutic strategies that may inhibit highly abnormal but adaptable cells. Body imposes a variety of bottlenecks ranging from different components of immunity to metabolic challenges to enforce quiescence and influence cancer evolution. As it is not possible to replicate all such bottlenecks in cell culture, our approach is to apply as severe a bottleneck as possible, thus eliminating all proliferative (non-adaptable) cells, leaving behind rare cells surviving in deep quiescence. We hypothesize that if the quiescent cell state being modeled can survive a severe bottleneck, it can also survive other bottlenecks of similar or lower severity. We have arrived at a prolonged lack of glutamine in cell culture medium as a bottleneck for selecting evolutionarily fit rare cells after trying several alternatives, including a lack of glucose, a partial lack of oxygen (hypoxia), or a lack of serum on surface that is unsuitable for cell attachment. While investigating glutamine dependence in aggressive triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, we serendipitously discovered that some rare cells could survive in deep quiescence not only this but variety of other metabolic and therapeutic challenges. Since glutamine and its metabolites are important in protein synthesis, nucleic acid synthesis, epigenome and epitranscriptome regulation, and in maintaining redox status, its sudden disappearance creates a catastrophe killing 99.99% cells; only rare cells survive in deep quiescence and evolve further to proliferate (an important feature of cancer recurrence/metastases). The adaptable cells selected in this manner have many desirable functional and molecular features that are relevant in resistant cancers with an elevated risk of recurrence. We will discuss our observations with rare cells (0.01% in population) surviving in quiescence for several weeks in aggressive breast cancer and melanoma cell lines and their functional characteristics. Our results obtained with adaptable cells from SUM149 TNBC cell line suggest that they are stem-like quiescent cells. Our gene expression analyses and phenotypic changes during quiescence suggest that like a model proposed for stem cell quiescence, cancer stem cells are not dormant; instead, they represent states of poised potential and active restraint as cells “idle” in anticipation of activation, proliferation, and differentiation. We will also discuss how we choose and evaluate therapies that would likely inhibit quiescent and slow-growing cancer cells. This framework may significantly improve anti-cancer drug discovery.

        <tr id="Introduction CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are valuable research models for mechanistic studies. However, gene conversion between a gene-pseudogene pair that share high sequence identity and form direct repeats in proximity on the same chromosome can interfere with the precision of gene editing. Mutations in the human beta-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1) are associated with Gaucher disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Lewy body dementia. During the creation of a GBA1 KO iPSC line, we detected about 70% gene conversion from its pseudogene GBAP1. These events maintained the reading frame and resulted from GBA1-specific cleavage by CRISPR/Cas9, without disrupting the GBA1 gene. Method To increase the percentage of alleles with out-of-frame indels for triggering nonsense-mediated decay of the GBA1 mRNA, we supplied the cells with two single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) donors as homology-directed repair (HDR) templates. Results We demonstrate that HDR using the ssODN templates effectively competes with gene conversion and enabled biallelic KO clone isolation, whereas the nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR)-based deletion rate remained the same. Discussion Here, we report a generalizable method to direct cellular DNA repair of double strand breaks at a target gene towards the HDR pathway using exogenous ssODN templates, allowing specific editing of one gene in a gene-pseudogene pair without disturbing the other.">

By tracing transmission of haplotypes, we identified 3,656,198 crossovers, as well as 92,485 aneuploid chromosomes. Counts of crossovers were lower in aneuploid versus euploid embryos, consistent with their role in chromosome pairing and segregation. Our analyses further revealed that a common haplotype spanning the meiotic cohesin SMC1B is significantly associated with both crossover count and maternal meiotic aneuploidy, with evidence supporting a non-coding cis-regulatory mechanism. Transcriptome- and phenome-wide association tests also implicated variation in the synaptonemal complex component C14orf39 and crossover-regulating ubiquitin ligases CCNB1IP1 and RNF212 in meiotic aneuploidy risk. More broadly, recombination and aneuploidy possess a partially shared genetic basis that also overlaps with reproductive aging traits. Our findings highlight the dual role of recombination in generating genetic diversity, while ensuring meiotic fidelity.">

 DHX9, a multi-functional RNA helicase, contributes to genome stability by unwinding nucleic acid secondary structures, including DNA/RNA hybrids (R-loops), circular RNA and G-quadruplexes. Multiple cancer types exhibit increased expression of DHX9, and selective dependance to DHX9 has been observed in molecular defined tumors that exhibit genomic instability. These tumors often have elevated replicative stress due to rapid unregulated proliferation and defective DNA damage repair (DDRD) pathways; DHX9 inhibition in these tumors further increases replicative stress and DNA damage to catastrophic levels. We previously demonstrated that DHX9 genetic loss or inhibition by the DHX9 tool compound ATX968 was efficacious in tumor types that exhibit DDRD and/or genomic instability; these include tumors with defective mismatch repair and/or high microsatellite instability (dMMR/MSI-H) or alterations in the DDR genes BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 (BRCA).
 Here we describe ATX-559, a potent, selective, orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of DHX9 helicase activity that is currently in clinical development. In preclinical studies, ATX-559 treatment leads to increased accumulation of R-loops and G-quadruplexes resulting in increased replicative stress and stalling, subsequent DNA damage, and cell death selectively in cancer models with high genomic instability. In a panel of 36 colorectal (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC) cell lines, approximately 55% were sensitive (IC50 ≤ 1 μM) to ATX-559 treatment, with enriched antiproliferation activity (80%) in dMMR/MSI-H cells. ATX-559 sensitivity was also enriched in breast cancer cell lines, including 76% of BRCA altered triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) models.
 ATX-559 is well tolerated in vivo across multiple cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, when dosed orally BID for periods out to 28 days or more. Robust dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and regression are selectively observed in CRC and EC dMMR/MSI-H and BRCA altered TNBC CDX models. TGI is correlative with plasma and tumor drug exposure, as well as with induction of the target engagement PD biomarker, circBRIP1, in both tumors and mouse PBMCs. ATX-559 was also profiled in a PDX mouse clinical trial design in vivo study of 46 models including TNBC, CRC, EC, and gastric cancers. Oral treatment of 45 mg/kg BID demonstrated enriched sensitivity in BRCA altered TNBC (75%) and dMMR/MSI-H (68%) PDX models.
 Together, these findings represent preclinical pharmacological validation of DHX9 as a selective therapeutic target in cancers that exhibit genomic instability and replication stress. ATX-559 is currently in a first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and molecularly defined cancers (NCT06625515).

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is still one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide. Treatment strategies include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Despite the availability of such a diverse set of therapeutic strategies, around a million people still die from this disease each year worldwide. Phenotypic intra-tumor heterogeneity, arising from both genetic and non-genetic origins, has become a significant focus of study due to its impact on treatment response. Among the various subpopulations within a tumor, the stem-like cells have been extensively investigated, as they are recognized as tumor initiators. In contrast, the subpopulations identified by the expression of genes associated with differentiation has received comparatively less attention. An interesting hypothesis is that differentiated populations might plastically give rise to stem cell populations fueling tumor regrowth. Here we examine phenotypic intra-tumor heterogeneity in patient-derived metastatic CRC (mCRC) tumoroids. Our goal was to decipher the unknown role of differentiated cells and to relate it to growth and therapeutic response. In particular, we sought to determine whether manipulating exogenously the proportions of differentiated cells within CRC tumoroids could alter the drug response. We analysed one KRAS wild type (wt) model and one mutant (kras) model by scRNAseq. Our data confirmed that tumoroids present two main subpopulations, one associated to stemness (with high expression of LGR5), and the other associated to differentiation genes (with high expression of KRT20), coherently with reported studies. First we identified two novel cell surface markers associated to the KRT20+ subpopulation: GABRA2 and GPRC5C. Using FACS, we confirmed that our models present a double-positive subpopulation at the protein level. RT-qPCR confirmed that the expression of both genes increased over time. We next studied the effect of different cytokines on the modulation of this subpopulation. We found that exogenously adding IL6 and TGF-b1 alters the proportion of our markers, with a stronger effect in the wt sample. For both models, ELISA assays did not indicate any significant secretion into the culture medium of these cytokines. Interestingly, we found a release of IL6 receptor (IL6R) in the medium, particularly from the wt sample, likely as a results of the previously characterized cleavage of its membrane-bound form. Furthermore, RT-qPCR showed that TGF-b1 induced its own expression, a phenomenon known as autoinduction. Our preliminary results using the wt sample indicate that pre-treatment with these cytokines affected the response to Oxaliplatin, making it more sensitive to the chemotherapeutic reagent. Overall, our results indicate that cytokines released in the tumor microenvironment might reshape the intra-tumor phenotypic heterogeneity impacting drug-response.

 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is vital in treating primary breast cancer, yet the mechanisms behind its success are not fully understood. Understanding transcriptomic changes associated with NAC resistance is crucial for improving treatment. This study sought to identify transcriptomic alterations linked to NAC resistance, enhance comprehension of treatment resistance, and lay the groundwork for developing targeted strategies for patients unresponsive to standard NAC protocols.We analyzed the transcriptomes of 44 matched breast cancer specimens from nonresponder patients to NAC at the Colombian National Cancer Institute. Samples were collected before and after NAC, representing luminalA, luminalB/HER2-positive, luminalB/HER2-negative, and TNBC subtypes. We performed differential gene expression and enrichment analyses and compared hallmark gene sets. Furthermore, we used deconvolution algorithms to estimate tumor microenvironment (TME) infiltration and assess immune population activity within the TME. Our findings were compared with publicly available GEO database data.Gene expression patterns before and after treatment were distinct across subtypes, with FOS and NR4A1 common to all, and ZBTB16 unique to luminalB. FOSB was found in all luminal samples. ATF3, DUSP1, EGR1, and JUN were shared among HER2-negative subtypes. GEM was common to luminalA and LuminalB/HER2-negative subtypes. Pathway variations included complement and coagulation cascades, and IL-17, TNF, MAPK, and NF-κB signaling pathways among subtypes and post-NAC specimens. Post-treatment LuminalA samples had increased CD4 memory cells, Tregs, and neutrophils. The LuminalB/HER2+ group showed higher CD8+ and CD4+ memory-activated cells post-treatment. In LuminalB/HER2- post-treatment samples, B cell CD4 memory resting, Macrophages M2, and neutrophils were elevated. TNBC post-treatment samples had higher resting mast cells and CD4+ memory cells. MSIGBD comparison of gene sets linked to cisplatin, docetaxel, and doxorubicin resistance identified several shared genes. GeoDatabases confirmed FOS and NR4A1 across all groups, with other DEGs shared among subtypes.Our research indicates that NAC affects gene expression, cell function, and interactions within the TME, potentially contributing to treatment resistance. Assessing TME components is crucial for predicting NAC effectiveness and reducing the risk of recurrence. These results highlight the importance of studying diverse patient populations to gain fresh perspectives and address disparities in treatment outcomes. This investigation emphasizes the need to understand how TME influences chemotherapy resistance, paving the way for the development of more precise and efficient therapeutic strategies.

 Background:
 Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) has been studied to show positive efficacy in endometrial cancer (EC). However, rational candidates for precision treatment with PARPi need to be further explored. Recently, it has been reported that tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) are sensitive to PARPi. Here, we aimed to assess the relationship between HRD and molecular subgroups in EC.
 Methods:
 HRD statues and gene characteristics of 372 EC patients were retrospectively collected from August, 2022 to August, 2024. HRD score was calculated as the sum of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI), and large-scale state transitions (LST) scores based on the next-generation sequencing (NGS) data.
 Results:
 Of the EC that underwent NGS testing, there were 5.38% (20/372) patients with
 BRCA1/2
 mutations, and the top two
 BRCA1/2
 mutated subgroups were microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) (2.96%) and copy number low (CN-L) (1.88%) subgroups. However, there were 10.75% (40/372) patients with positive HRD, which is largely restricted to copy number high (CN-H) (4.57%), CN-L (2.96%) and MSI-H (2.96%) subgroup. Interestingly, based on HRD score with the cutoff of 30, there were mostly CN-H and CN-L subgroups and almost no
 POLE
 mutation and MSI-H subgroups in non
 BRCA1/2
 mutation and positive HRD patients.
 Conclusions:
 BRCA1/2
 mutations and positive HRD were seen in 5.38% and 10.75% EC patients, respectively. HRD score testing, based on LOH, TAI, and LST, may help select patients benefiting from PARPi with particular reference to CN-H and CN-L subgroups.

        <tr id="Exquisitely chemosensitive initially, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) exhibits dismal outcomes owing to rapid transition to chemoresistance. Elucidating the genetic underpinnings has been challenging owing to limitations with cellular models. As SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models mimic therapeutic responses, we perform genetic screens in chemosensitive PDX models to identify drivers of chemoresistance. cDNA overexpression screens identify MYC, MYCN, and MYCL, while CRISPR deletion screens identify KEAP1 loss as driving chemoresistance. Deletion of KEAP1 switched a chemosensitive SCLC PDX model to become chemoresistant and resulted in sensitivity to inhibition of glutamine metabolism. Data from the IMpower133 clinical trial revealed ~6% of patients with extensive-stage SCLC exhibit KEAP1 genetic alterations, with activation of a KEAP1/NRF2 transcriptional signature associated with reduced survival upon chemotherapy treatment. While roles for KEAP1/NRF2 have been unappreciated in SCLC, our genetic screens revealed KEAP1 loss as a driver of chemoresistance, while patient genomic analyses demonstrate clinical importance.">

        <tr id="Double‐strand breaks (DSBs) are universally acknowledged as the most detrimental type of DNA damage, and their effective repair primarily depends on the non‐homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Such DSBs, which require NHEJ for resolution, can arise from intrinsic and extrinsic DNA‐damaging factors or emerge naturally during essential biological processes like V(D)J recombination and antibody class switch recombination.Failure to properly repair DSBs may lead to genomic instability, disruption of cellular functions, and immunodeficiency, thereby promoting the development of hematologic malignancies. Conversely, overexpression of NHEJ‐related genes can enhance resistance to DNA‐damaging therapies in these cancers. Analyzing mutations in key classical NHEJ (cNHEJ) components and understanding their mechanisms could provide valuable biomarkers for predicting therapeutic outcomes and guiding treatment decisions. Consequently, defects in cNHEJ may offer insights into the development of novel drugs targeting DNA repair pathways.We focus on genetic changes and alterations in gene regulation, while also providing an overview of cNHEJ.">

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), defined by a lack of hormone receptors and lack of HER2 amplification, is the deadliest subtype of breast cancer. TNBC kills 1 in 3 patients and while promising new drugs based on PARP inhibition and anti-PD1 immunotherapy can extend survival in selected patients, 30-40% of patients relapse or fail therapy. Increasing evidence suggests that TNBC tumors harbor stem-like tumorigenic cancer cells with high plasticity, capable of replenishing cancer cell populations and linked to adverse outcomes. Unfortunately, the phenotypic diversity, microenvironmental contexture, and functional significance of these cells remain poorly understood and available marker genes are not specific, precluding rational drug development.



 We created a multimodal single-cell RNA-seq atlas of 80 TNBC patients, including clinical covariates such as BRCA1/2 mutations, race/ethnicity, and prior treatment status. We then defined differentiation-associated malignant cell states using a novel interpretable deep learning approach for determining single-cell potency. We subsequently interrogated geospatial features, including localized microenvironments of less differentiated malignant cells, and linked them to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response.



 Our quantitative analysis shows that TNBC is enriched in cancer cells with high developmental potency as compared to other breast cancer subtypes, consistent with its aggressive phenotype. Critically, we observed a strong association between enrichment of high potency cells and resistance to ICI treatment across human and mouse bulk expression data, both within TNBC and across other cancer types, a finding that we experimentally validated in a murine model of TNBC. In scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data, we defined striking relationships between less differentiated cancer cells and context-dependent T cell states indicative of strong immunosuppressive capability. In line with this, we found that knockout of genes associated with immature cancer cells promotes TNBC cell killing by T cells in a co-culture CRISPR screen. Ongoing experiments include perturbations of novel therapeutic targets emerging from this work, with the goal of improving immunotherapy responses and ultimately extending patient survival.



 We anticipate that our approach will expand our understanding of developmental landscapes in TNBC and lead to new opportunities for developing targeted drugs in this devastating disease.

 Prostate cancer (PCa) is a heterogeneous disease both within and across individuals. Genomic alterations, epigenetic changes, and interactions with cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to different states in tumor cells. Single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) can provide insights into the transcriptional heterogeneity of tumor cells and cell types in the TME. However, most scRNAseq studies are limited by small sample sizes. Here, we performed the first gene program association study in PCa to identify gene modules and immune cell types associated with intra-tumoral heterogeneity and metastasis.



 14 datasets were merged to create a harmonized scRNAseq atlas. Copy number inference and boosted gradient tree models were trained to identify the tumor cells. Celda was used to identify co-expression modules. Linear mixed effect models were used to associate modules with clinical phenotypes. Finally, a transformer model similar to RoBERTa for annotation of PCa datasets was developed and validated in 2 independent datasets.



 We compiled an atlas of 560, 492 cells from 128 PCa patients with localized primary PCa, Castration resistant PCa (CRPC), and metastatic PCa from 7 different sites. 166 co-expression modules were identified across 106, 998 tumor cells. 2 cell-cycle modules were consistently upregulated across all metastatic sites while prostate lineage and antigen presentation modules were consistently downregulated. Different metastatic sites exhibited unique module expression patterns. For example, a module of FOLH1 and SPON2 was upregulated specifically in brain metastasis while erythroid modules were found in liver metastasis. 4 different modules were significantly higher in neuroendocrine prostate cancers (NEPC). Each NE tumor was not monolithic but expressed a unique combination of these modules. A novel subtype of NEPC tumors was identified which predominantly expresses the HES1 module instead of the canonical NE module. We developed a novel scoring system to identify NEPC tumors in bulk RNA-seq data using a combination of NE-associated modules which performed better than previously established gene set signatures (AUC = 0.938). Within the TME, we detected a T-cell cluster signified by heat shock protein genes enriched in African American PCa patients than European American patients. Furthermore, a transformer neural network was developed for automated annotation of scRNAseq PCa datasets which achieved a 91% accuracy in validation datasets.



 We generated a comprehensive atlas of cells from PCa, characterized novel gene programs that defined tumors cells in localized and metastatic samples, identified a novel subtype of NEPC, and developed a robust computational tool to predict these states in new studies. These findings can potentially be used clinically to stratify high-risk patients with localized disease.

 The tumor suppressor p53 is activated by a range of cellular stresses including DNA damage, oncogenic signals, and nutrient deprivation. Upon activation, p53 transcriptionally upregulates an extensive repertoire of genes including those affecting cell fates such as cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. What remains unclear is how information is conveyed through p53 to elicit the appropriate downstream responses according to the nature of the upstream stress. Changes in p53 temporal expression dynamics as well as specific p53 post-translational modifications (PTMs) are known to differentially regulate target gene induction. However, with over 100 known PTMs possible on p53, technical limitations have restricted the ability to detect the combinations of modifications on whole p53 molecules.
 Using a state-of-the-art mass spectrometry method (I2MS) which enabled the first measurement of individual intact human p53 proteins, we have begun to uncover the landscapes of combinatorial PTMs from different p53 activation regimes in cancer cell lines. Together with complementary p53 modification specific antibodies we identified changes in PTM patterns which were both stimuli and time dependent. For example, we found that in response to double-strand DNA breaks, p53 exhibits pulses of expression. Furthermore, p53’s post-translational modification state is altered between successive pulses, which we ascertained the most prominent temporal change in p53 PTMs in response to DNA damage to be a reduction of multiple p53 lysine acetylations. Inhibition of the deacetylase HDAC1, but not SIRT1, prevented the reduction in p53 acetylation, causing overexpression of senescence and apoptotic genes, and corresponding cell fates. Finally, we abrogated lysine acetylation by generating KR (lysine to arginine) mutations at single or multiple sites on p53, and found that acetylation sites are functionally non-redundant, with specific combinations exerting unique transcriptional effects on p53 target gene inductions. These results demonstrate an interplay between dynamics and modifications as a mechanistic strategy for cellular hubs like p53 to temporally organize multiple processes in individual cells. In addition, it highlights the importance of accounting for dynamical combinations of p53 PTMs in order to achieve the desired cellular response and efficacy of p53-mediated cancer therapies.

        <tr id="Background Given the scarcity of effective therapeutic targets, metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) has shorter survival times compared to other advanced breast cancer subtypes. Although chemo-immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in PD-L1+ mTNBC has shown promise, survival benefit remains modest. Therefore, it is crucial to gain improved insight into the mechanisms underlying response and resistance to checkpoint inhibition in mTNBC. Methods We employed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), single cell secretomics, and flow cytometry to identify transcriptomic and proteomic peripheral immune cell signatures associated with response and non-response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and chemotherapy in mTNBC. Results Transcriptomic analysis reveal divergent transcriptional programming of CD33+ myeloid cells between responders and non-responders, even in pretreatment PBMC samples. This divergence, in responders, is characterized by an immune-promoting CD33+ cell phenotype involving IL1b signaling compared to non-responders, where an immunosuppressive phenotype marked by IL1b inhibition is observed. These baseline differences become more pronounced during the course of chemo-immunotherapy. Differences in CD33+ cell phenotype result in functional differences in lymphocyte activities between responders and non-responders. Depletion of CD33+ cells in pre-treatment samples from non-responders, restores T cell effector function. Conclusion Our findings highlight CD33+ cell phenotype as a key determinant of response to chemo-immunotherapy, which can be assessed from peripheral blood. This offers a valuable tool in the context of metastatic TNBC, in which tissue sampling is often challenging.">

        <tr id="Introduction Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has shown promise in treating advanced colorectal cancer, particularly in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. However, only a subset of these patients responds favorably, highlighting the need for strategies to improve immunotherapy efficacy. Methods To identify potential regulators of immunotherapy response, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We performed multi-omics analyses and functional assays in both human and murine colorectal cancer cell lines. Additionally, we evaluated tumor growth and immune cell infiltration using syngeneic mouse models. Results Our analysis revealed that RNA binding motif protein 15 (RBM15) is highly expressed in colorectal cancer and correlates with poor patient prognosis. Functional studies demonstrated that RBM15 loss led to increased expression of fumarate hydratase (FH). This led to decreased levels of fumarate, a metabolite known to suppress anti-tumor immune responses. In vivo, RBM15 depletion significantly delayed tumor progression and enhanced CD8⁺ T cell infiltration and activation in the tumor microenvironment. Discussion These findings identify RBM15 as a negative regulator of anti-tumor immunity in colorectal cancer. Targeting RBM15 may represent a novel strategy to boost immune responsiveness and improve outcomes for patients undergoing immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Rare tumors are unique cancers that often present distinct biological behaviors and treatment responses. Researchers face significant challenges in the study of those tumors due to limited patient samples, lack of comprehensive genomic data, and difficulties in establishing appropriate preclinical models for effective drug testing. The identification of effective drug combinations for cancer treatment remains a major challenge, largely due to tumor heterogeneity and variable therapeutic responses. ATR is a key kinase involved in the DNA damage response. The combination of ATR inhibitors with temozolomide (TMZ) [ATRi+TMZ] enhances the cytotoxic effects of TMZ by targeting DNA damage response pathways, particularly in cancer cells with impaired DNA repair mechanisms, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors resistant to conventional treatments. This study utilized gene expression profiling of 38 rare tumor patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models available in the NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository (PDMR) (https://pdmr.cancer.gov) to identify potential biomarkers that predict responses to TMZ combined with either of two ATR inhibitors, i.e., AZD6738 (Ceralasertib) and BAY1895344 (Elimusertib). We conducted comprehensive analyses including gene expression correlation with response, network interaction and gene set enrichment analysis. Our study revealed that lower MGMT expression (i.e., MGMTlow, normalized count <50) in PDX models was associated with sensitivity to ATRi+TMZ combination therapy as expected; 3/4 and 4/4 MGMTlow models were sensitive to AZD6738+TMZ and BAY1895344+TMZ combination, respectively. However, MGMThigh status did not necessarily denote resistance; a portion of MGMThigh models were also sensitive to the ATRi+TMZ combinations. In MGMThigh PDXs, network analysis and GSEA revealed that ATRi+TMZ sensitive models had significant (p<0.001) enrichment of highly expressed DNA replication genes such as MCM2 compared to resistant models. Moreover, elevated MCM2 expression was associated with sensitivity to ATRi+TMZ: 8/8 and 7/9 MGMThigh/MCM2high models were sensitive to AZD6738+TMZ and BAY1895344+TMZ, respectively. Correspondingly, 14/18 and 24/24 MGMThigh/MCM2low PDX models were resistant to AZD6738+TMZ and BAY1895344+TMZ, respectively. We used mass spectrometry-based proteomics data from a subset of rare tumor models in our RNAseq-based dataset to validate the MGMT/MCM2 expression association with ATRi+TMZ response, confirming a similar trend. Our findings revealed distinct expression signatures associated with favorable responses to two ATR inhibitors when individually combined with TMZ, highlighting candidate markers that could guide treatment decisions. Additional validation in a larger study would establish the potential utility of these candidate genes for patient selection in clinical trials.

 Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a highly aggressive malignancy and the leading cause of gynecological cancer-related deaths. The majority of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages (III-IV), where treatment involves surgical debulking followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. While initial responses to therapy are often favorable, over 70% of advanced-stage EOC patients experience recurrence, typically accompanied by resistance to standard of care treatments. This chemoresistance significantly limits therapeutic success and worsens patient prognosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving resistance is critical for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence highlights the role of miRNAs in regulating gene expression networks associated with DNA damage repair and chemoresistance. miRNA-221-5p has been implicated in modulating tumor progression and therapeutic responses in various cancers. Here, we investigate its role in ovarian cancer, focusing on regulating RAD18 and RAD51—key mediators of DNA damage tolerance and homologous recombination repair (HRR). Our analysis of miRNA expression in a panel of human ovarian cancer cell lines revealed low to undetectable levels of miRNA-221-5p, coupled with elevated expression of DNA damage response and repair genes such as RAD18 and RAD51. Our experimental data demonstrate that miRNA-221-5p regulates RAD18 and RAD51 transcripts through 3’-UTR, leading to their post-transcriptional repression and subsequent restoration of ovarian cancer cell sensitivity to platinum drugs. Mechanistically, our results confirm that miRNA-221-5p epigenetically regulates RAD18- and RAD51-mediated DNA damage tolerance and homologous recombination repair. Importantly, restoring miRNA-221-5p downregulates RAD18 and RAD51 and sensitizes chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells to platinum drugs, offering a promising strategy to enhance therapeutic outcomes. Overall, our data demonstrate that miRNA-221-5p is a critical regulator of chemotherapy-induced epigenetic and transcriptional alterations, making it a prospective therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance and avoiding EOC recurrence.

 Adult stem cells possess a unique ability for asymmetric self-renewal, enabling the simultaneous production of non-stem cell progenitors and self-renewing stem cells, distinguishing them from symmetrical cell division. In cancer cells, the regulation of cell division is often disrupted to sustain proliferation. However, specific patterns might be essential for evading cell death and adapting to the tumor microenvironment. In this study, transcriptomic data from engineered p53-expressing and p53-null mouse fibroblasts were re-analyzed to identify expression signatures of asymmetric self-renewal associated (ASRA) and p53/IMPDH2-related self-renewal patterns associated (SRPA). Pathway analysis revealed that ASRA signatures were enriched in immune regulation and angiogenesis pathways, in addition to cell cycle regulation. Genomic analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database demonstrated correlations between ASRA signatures and survival outcomes, as well as molecular properties across various cancer types, including stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). Additionally, public single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and clinical dataset analyses revealed the role of ASRA genes in the interactions between tumor cells and surrounding immune and stromal cells. These findings suggested that targeting ASRA signatures is a promising strategy for developing novel cancer therapies.

        <tr id="Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically develops in the context of chronic liver disease, where prolonged hepatocyte exposure to inflammation drives the synergistic accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Epigenetic regulation encompasses multiple mechanisms that govern the transcription machinery accessibility to DNA. This process is regulated by the addition and removal of covalent marks on chromatin, which can either affect DNA-histone interactions or serve as scaffolds for other proteins, among other mechanisms. Recent research has revealed that epigenetic alterations can disrupt chromatin homeostasis, redirecting transcriptional regulation to favour cancer-promoting states. Consequently, these alterations play a pivotal role in the acquisition of cancer hallmarks and provide insights into several biological processes involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. This review highlights the key epigenetic mechanisms underlying the development, progression and dissemination of HCC, with a particular focus on DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications. This knowledge is relevant for guiding the development of innovative therapeutic approaches based on epigenetic modulators.">

        <tr id="Oncogene-induced replicative stress (RS) drives tumor progression by disrupting genome stability, primarily through transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), which promote R-loop accumulation and trigger the DNA damage response (DDR). In this study, we investigate the role of chromatin regulators in exacerbating TRCs and R-loop accumulation in cancer. We find that in breast cancer patients, the simultaneous upregulation of MYC and the H2A.Z-specific chaperone ANP32E correlates with increased genomic instability. Genome-wide analyses reveal that ANP32E-driven H2A.Z turnover alters RNA polymerase II processivity, leading to the accumulation of long R-loops at TRC sites. Furthermore, we show that ANP32E overexpression enhances TRC formation and activates an ATR-dependent DDR, predisposing cancer cells to R-loop-mediated genomic fragility. By exploiting the vulnerability of ANP32E-expressing cancer cells to ATR inhibitors, we find that tumors relied on this DDR pathway, whose inhibition halts their pro-metastatic capacity. These findings identify ANP32E as a key driver of TRC-induced genomic instability, indicating ATR inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for ANP32E-overexpressing tumors.">

 Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in US with a 5-year survival rate of 13%. Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, and conventional treatments remain ineffective and highly toxic to these patients as both chemotherapy and radiation affect normal, healthy cells, leading to adverse side effects. We have adapted CRISPR-Cas9 as a cancer-specific killing strategy that spares normal cells. CRISPR-Cas9 is a molecular scissor that induces DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) at its targeted genomic locations. We use CRISPR-Cas9 to target the subset of somatic mutations that create protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs). Using S. pyogenes Cas9 that recognizes a 5’-NGG-3’ PAM, we identified somatic single base substitutions (SBSs) that give rise to novel PAMs (e.g. NCG→NGG), and use the upstream sequence to design sgRNAs for cancer-targeting. We have discovered that ∼13% of SBSs in PC form novel PAMs, and these cancer-specific sgRNAs exhibited on-target activity and lack of off-target events. Notably, while examining WGS data from rapid autopsy samples, we found that 90% of PAMs were maintained among primary carcinomas and metastases. Using multi-target sgRNAs targeting 2-16 sites in the non-coding regions of human genome, we demonstrate a dose-response relationship in which >10 target sites are required to achieve >99% cell elimination. Moreover, we established that simultaneous induction of multiple DSBs by CRISPR-Cas9 causes extreme chromosomal instability that ultimately leads to cell death. We detected massive chromosomal aberrations, including dicentrics, ring chromosomes, and polyploidization. Surprisingly, CRISPR-Cas9-induced DSBs are significantly more cytotoxic in PCs than a comparable number of radiation-induced DSBs, in which the number of DSBs required to achieve equitoxic effects was ∼3 times higher for radiation than CRISPR-Cas9. Finally, we have developed a pipeline to screen for the most toxic sgRNAs in a given PC for selective killing. Using our PAM-based approach, we identified >100 Panc10.05-specific sgRNAs that have no off-target activity at 0- and 1-mismatch sites. We cloned them into lentiviral vectors and transduced in bulk, followed by NGS to discover sgRNAs that decreased in representation in the targeted cell line but not in the controls. We selected the top sgRNAs that have 100% variant allele frequency (VAF), cloned 4 of them into a multi-sgRNA expression vector, and transduced it into co-cultures consisting of two PC cell lines. Greater than 85% selective reduction of the targeted cell line was detected. Then, we selected nine top sgRNAs, transduced them as a pool into Panc10.05 cell line, and injected these cells into athymic, nude mice for tumor growth. We observed >90% tumor growth inhibition with these cancer-specific sgRNAs. Overall, our study highlights the therapeutic potential of CRISPR-Cas9 as an anti-cancer strategy and supports the genetic targeting of PCs.

 Recently we and others reported high prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) in long-term survivors of pediatric cancers by performing ultra-deep panel sequencing of peripheral blood samples, a phenomena significantly associated with exposures to radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic agents. Motivated by a preliminary finding that a therapy-related STAT3 CH mutations were highly enriched in T-cells of 3 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (HL) survivors, we initiated a systematic investigation to map the CH mutations across different immune cells populations. Blood samples of 108 survivors of 13 pediatric cancer types (4 hematological, 8 solid and 1 central nervous system (CNS) tumor types), known to harbor CH mutations discovered by prior bulk sample analysis, were selected for multi-omics single-cell profiling with Mission Bio Tapestri assay. For mutation screening, we designed a panel of 29 amplicons across 12 genes, covering 52 CH mutations detected in bulk samples. Amongst the 23 completed samples, we identified 99 mutations in CH-genes (DNMT3A, STAT3, TP53, KRAS, TET2, and ASXL1), and 67.7% of those were found in all cell types and the rest were present in at least two cell types. We discovered that a subset of CH mutations was enriched (FDR < 0.05) in certain cell types across several samples. For example, STAT3 Y640F mutations were consistently enriched in CD8 T-cells in 6 out of 7 HL samples with a mean fold change of 18.5. DNMT3A mutations were enriched in cells from both myeloid (monocytes) and lymphoid (CD4/8 T-cells and NK-cells) lineages and affected samples from five cancer types. Specifically, we found that DNMT3A mutations were enriched in monocytes in 2 HL and 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases with an average fold change of 2.3; and in CD8 T-cells in 5 samples from Wilms tumor, soft tissue sarcoma, ALL, HL, and CNS with an average fold change of 4.9. KRAS L19F was found to be enriched in monocytes and NK-cells in an ALL sample. By contrast, we observed a uniform distribution of some TP53 mutations across all cell types, suggesting that they confer comparable selective advantage across all immune cell types, consistent with the biological function of TP53 in cell cycle. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale multi-omics single-cell profiling of CH mutations in long-term survivors of pediatric cancer. The differential clonal expansion in immune cell populations demonstrates the potential impact of CH mutations on immune cell dysfunction. This suggests that CH mutations may contribute to long-term adverse health outcomes related to the immune system in long-term survivors beyond the direct cause of secondary neoplasms, which will warrant future investigations using the valuable data resource established through this study.

 Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is the stand of care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). For microsatellite-stable (MSS) LARC patients, combining immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with radiotherapy has shown improved tumor regression, though the mechanisms behind tumor response remain unclear. Here, we analyzed 60 pre-, mid- and post-treatment tumor samples from 39 LARC patients in the TORCH clinical trial, utilizing single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to explore cell dynamics and their association with therapeutic efficacy. In well responders, combination therapy expanded the CD8+ and CD4+ memory T cell pool, which interacted with type 2 dendritic cells and clustered around non-malignant epithelial cells, forming part of tertiary lymphoid structures, as validated by spatial transcriptomics. In poor responders, the tumor microenvironment was enriched with immunosuppressive cells clustering around cancer-associated fibroblasts. This study uncovers mechanisms underlying the efficacy of radiotherapy combined with ICIs and provides valuable resources for identifying targets in MSS LARC patients.

 Despite increasing incorporation of gene panel testing into radiotherapeutic decision-making, there is no established method to tailor prescribed radiation regimens to individual tumor radiosensitivity. We propose a novel approach to assessing evolutionary determinants of radioresistance from patient-derived tumor samples. We hypothesized that pre-existing resistance to oxidative damage in tumor microenvironment (TME) can define a cell's evolutionary trajectory and its radiosensitivity. In contrast with the current genetic panels, we use a panel catered toward heterogeneity within the tumor and the TME niches, which may harbor radioresistant populations from collateral TME mechanisms of resistance. The aim is to develop an AI-based algorithm using these eco-evolutionary results to individualize radiation dose in patients, thus minimizing the percentage of non-responders. 3D spheroids of several breast cancer cell lines were grown and collected at multiple time points after 10 Gy of radiation. MALDI data was acquired in negative and positive ionization mode for spatial lipidomics and metabolomics analysis. Additionally, spatial single cell multiplexed immunofluorescence was performed on the sequential cut to MALDI using markers associated with hypoxia, acidosis, ROS, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Then we grew patient derived organoids (PDO) of breast cancer and irradiated them and analyzed them as described above. Based on a previously validated oxygen diffusion model, spheroids were categorized according to size, with those <240 micrometers in diameter designated as O-spheroids (oxygenated) and those ≥ 240 microns designated as H-spheroids (hypoxic core). While the irradiated O-spheroid growth curves plateaued upon irradiation, H-spheroids grew at the same rate as the non-irradiated controls. To investigate this phenomenon, habitats and cell phenotypes were defined using spatial multi-omics data from MALDI and multiplexed-IF, respectively. We found differential distributions of habitats in radiated spheroids as determined by the cluster size and abundance spatio-temporally. We discovered a switch in the sphingolipid metabolism pathway. Using principles of ecology and evolution, we have developed a novel approach to identifying radiosensitivity markers. Detecting these cell states and ecological niches in patients’ pre-treatment biopsies can inform a more individualized approach to radiotherapy.

 Germline mutations in BRCA2 confer up to a 70% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer due to BRCA2’s critical roles in homologous recombination repair, replication fork stability, and cell cycle regulation. In BRCA2 mutation carriers, mammary epithelial cells are haplo-insufficient, meaning a single functional allele is inadequate to maintain genomic stability and suppress tumorigenesis. Genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer, frequently involves fragile site instability, particularly at common fragile sites (CFSs), which are hotspots for chromosomal rearrangements under replication stress. While the association between fragile site instability and cancer has been documented, the specific link between BRCA2 haploinsufficiency and CFS instability remains unexplored. To address this gap, we modeled BRCA2 haploinsufficiency in human mammary epithelial cells using small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown and induced replication stress with the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin (APH). Cytogenetic analysis using DAPI banding revealed increased CFS instability, particularly at FRA18B, in BRCA2-deficient cells compared to controls. Furthermore, we observed elevated levels of mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS) in BRCA2-deficient cells, a process typically activated at under-replicated regions of CFSs during mitosis to preserve genome integrity. These findings demonstrate that BRCA2 haploinsufficiency promotes CFS instability and aberrant MiDAS, uncovering novel mechanisms of genomic instability in preneoplastic mammary epithelial cells. By elucidating these early molecular events in BRCA2-associated breast cancer, our study provides critical insights into the etiology of tumorigenesis and lays the groundwork for innovative strategies to stabilize the genome in high-risk individuals, potentially improving breast cancer prevention and outcomes.

 Werner syndrome helicase (WRN) is a RecQ helicase family member that plays an important role in genome stability, primarily through its involvement in DNA repair processes such as nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Upregulation of WRN in mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumor cells facilitates DNA damage repair and, thus, cell survival. In these cells, WRN inhibition induces double-strand DNA breaks, leading to cell death. Therefore, WRN has emerged as a novel, promising synthetic lethality target in MMR-deficient/MSI-H solid tumors, particularly endometrial and colorectal cancers, which exhibit MMR-deficiency/MSI-H in approximately 20%-30% and 5%-15% of cases, respectively. GSK4418959, a WRNi, is a distinct, oral small molecule that uniquely binds to an allosteric site in the WRN helicase domain, exhibiting synthetic lethality in MMR-deficient/MSI-H tumor cells. It showed potent antitumor activity in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models by selectively inducing DNA damage and, consequently, death of MSI-H cancer cells.



 The SYLVER first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, phase 1/2 trial (NCT06710847) opened on December 9, 2024 and aims to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of GSK4418959, as monotherapy or in combination with a programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor. The trial comprises WRNi monotherapy dose escalation (part 1), WRNi monotherapy dose expansion (part 2), and dose escalation of WRNi + PD-1 inhibitor (part 3). Key eligibility criteria include age ≥18 years, an advanced MMR-deficient/MSI-H solid tumor, an ECOG PS score of 0-1, and having exhausted standard of care (parts 1 and 3) or received 1-3 lines of systemic therapy, including ≥1 immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (part 2). Patients who have not recovered from treatment-associated adverse events, have uncontrolled hypertension, or have received prior treatment with a WRNi are ineligible. Primary endpoints are safety during the dose-limiting toxicity observation period (ie, first 21 days; parts 1 and 3) and objective response rate (part 2). Secondary endpoints include overall safety (parts 1-3), pharmacokinetics (parts 1-3), progression-free survival (part 2), and duration of response (part 2). Tumor responses will be assessed per RECIST 1.1. Planned enrollment is approximately 133 patients in the US, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands, with potential to expand to additional countries for later stages of the study.
