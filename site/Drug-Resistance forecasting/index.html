        <tr id="DHFR gene amplification is commonly present in methotrexate (MTX)-resistant colon cancer cells and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, we proposed an integrative framework to characterize the amplified region by using a combination of single-molecule real-time sequencing, next-generation optical mapping, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C). We identified an amplification unit spanning 11 genes, from the DHFR gene to the ATP6AP1L gene position, with high adjusted interaction frequencies on chromosome 5 (~2.2 Mbp) and a twenty-fold tandemly amplified region, and novel inversions at the start and end positions of the amplified region as well as frameshift insertions in most of the MSH and MLH genes were detected. These mutations might stimulate chromosomal breakage and cause the dysregulation of mismatch repair. Characterizing the tandem gene-amplified unit may be critical for identifying the mechanisms that trigger genomic rearrangements. These findings may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the amplification process and the evolution of drug resistance. Sequencing a large region of DNA containing many surplus copies of genes linked to drug resistance in colon cancer cells may illuminate how these genomic rearrangements arise. Such regions of gene amplification are highly repetitive, making them impossible to sequence using ordinary methods, and little is known about how they are generated. Using advanced methods, Jeong-Sun Seo at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital in South Korea and co-workers sequenced a region of gene amplification in colon cancer cells. The amplified region was approximately 20 times the length of that in healthy cells and contained many copies of an eleven-gene segment, including a gene implicated in drug resistance. The region also contained mutations in chromosomal repair genes which would disrupt repair pathways. These results illuminate the genetic changes that lead to gene amplification and drug resistance in cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Cancer drug resistance is multi-factorial, driven by heritable (epi)genetic changes but also phenotypic plasticity. Here, we dissected drivers of resistance by perturbing colorectal cancer patient-derived organoids longitudinally with drugs in sequence. Combined longitudinal lineage tracking, single cell multi-omics analysis, evolutionary modelling, and machine learning revealed that different targeted drugs select for distinct subclones, supporting rationally designed drug sequences. The cellular memory of drug resistance was encoded as a heritable epigenetic configuration from which multiple transcriptional programs could run, supporting a one-to-many (epi)genotype-to-phenotype map that explains how clonal expansions and plasticity manifest together. This epigenetic landscape may ensure drug resistant subclones can exhibit distinct phenotypes in changing environments while still preserving the cellular memory encoding for their selective advantage. Chemotherapy resistance was instead entirely driven by transient phenotypic plasticity rather than stable clonal selection. Inducing further chromosomal instability before drug application changed clonal evolution but not convergent transcriptional programs. Collectively, these data show how genetic and epigenetic alterations are selected to engender a "permissive epigenome" that enables phenotypic plasticity.">

        <tr id="Cancer cells that survive therapeutic drug pressure are a significant cause of disease relapse and progression, impeding curative cancer treatment. Drug-triggered Darwinian selection and the emergence of subclones harbouring specific mutations that confer resistance have been well documented and extensively studied. However, these genetic alterations, while important, do not fully explain clinical observations where some patients, after a drug holiday, regain sensitivity to the same treatment despite previous disease progression. This phenomenon highlights the possibility that drug resistance may not solely rely on genetic mutations but could also involve reversible, non-genetic mechanisms. Recent studies have highlighted the existence of drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs), a subpopulation of cancer cells that can survive short-term therapeutic pressure without acquiring resistance-associated genetic alterations. These cells exhibit a temporary yet reversible tolerance to the initial treatment while also acquiring cross-tolerance to other anti-cancer therapies. The presence of DTPs underscores a dynamic and complex plasticity in tumours, wherein cancer cells can utilise epigenetic rewiring, metabolic reprogramming, and specific signalling pathways to transit between drug-tolerant and drug-sensitive states to adapt to environmental pressures. Furthermore, this adaptive resilience enables DTPs to act as a reservoir for the development of genetically stable resistance, resulting in cancer therapy failure and eventual relapse. In this mini-review, we examine recent evidence on DTPs to provide an overview of their characteristics, development, and survival mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men worldwide, with tumor heterogeneity, therapy resistance, and lineage plasticity posing significant clinical challenges. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), while initially effective, often culminates in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), may fueled by castration-resistant prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs) with adaptive self-renewal and regenerative capacities. Emerging evidence implicates prostate CSCs as pivotal contributors to tumor heterogeneity, drug resistance, and disease recurrence. These stem subpopulations exhibit intrinsic adaptability through genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental reprogramming, enabling survival under androgen-deprived conditions and fostering clonal diversification. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the identity, regulation, and functional dynamics of prostate stem cells, emphasizing their role in shaping the tumor ecosystem. By dissecting the genetic drivers, epigenetic alteration and crosstalk with microenvironment, this review underscores critical triggers on prostate CSCs determination and differentiation. Additionally, we discuss emerging strategies to target prostate CSCs-specific vulnerabilities, including molecular drivers of stemness and plasticity, to improve therapeutic outcomes for advanced prostate malignancies. This synthesis underscores the critical need to unravel prostate stem cells biology for developing precision therapies against prostate CSCs-driven adaptation in prostate diseases.">

        <tr id="Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) can lead to metastasis and high mortality rates known for its aggressive and invasive properties. Currently, primary treatment options of surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy have many therapeutic limitations for OSCC patients due to its dynamic evolutionary pathways and the development of resistance to conventional therapies. Moreover, previous studies fail to emphasize the roles of cellular heterogeneity, drug resistance, and evolutionary trajectories in OSCC. This review explores the intricate tumor microenvironment landscape of OSCC, focusing on the cellular heterogeneity, drug resistance, and evolutionary trajectories as well as genetic, epigenetic, and environmental risk factors contributing to the OSCC progression. Tumor heterogeneity arises from environmental exposures (e.g., tobacco, HPV infection, dietary carcinogens) that drive clonal evolution, creating subpopulations of cells with distinct mutational profiles and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Recent advances in in the precision medicine and combination therapy of OSCC paves the way for innovative therapeutic strategies, such as targeting molecular subclones through real-time monitoring and leveraging computational models to predict treatment response. By recognizing tumor heterogeneity as both a driver of therapeutic resistance and a therapeutic target, precision medicine frameworks can integrate environmental risk factor data, molecular profiling, and early detection tools to optimize outcomes. This review underscores the necessity for a multidisciplinary approach to understand and combat the complexity of OSCC, proposing directions for future research to enhance diagnosis and treatment efficacy. Graphical Abstract This review highlights how research into cellular heterogeneity, drug resistance, and evolutionary trajectories in oral squamous cell carcinoma is revolutionizing our understanding and treatment of the disease, emphasizing personalized approaches that could significantly enhance patient care in oncology.">

        <tr id="Anticancer chemotherapy is an essential part of cancer treatment, but the emergence of resistance remains a major hurdle. Metabolic reprogramming is a notable phenotype associated with the acquisition of drug resistance. Here, we develop a computational framework that predicts metabolic gene targets capable of reverting the metabolic state of drug-resistant cells to that of drug-sensitive parental cells, thereby sensitizing the resistant cells. The computational framework performs single-gene knockout simulation of genome-scale metabolic models that predicts genome-wide metabolic flux distribution in drug-resistant cells, and clusters the resulting knockout flux data using uniform manifold approximation and projection, followed by k-means clustering. From the clustering analysis, knockout genes that lead to the flux data near that of drug-sensitive cells are considered drug sensitization targets. This computational approach is demonstrated using doxorubicin- and paclitaxel-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells. Drug sensitization targets are further refined based on proteome and metabolome data, which generate GOT1 for doxorubicin-resistant MCF7, GPI for paclitaxel-resistant MCF7, and SLC1A5 as a common target. These targets are experimentally validated where treating drug-resistant cancer cells with small-molecule inhibitors results in increased sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to doxorubicin or paclitaxel. The applicability of the developed framework is further demonstrated using drug-resistant triple-negative breast cancer cells. Taken together, the computational framework predicts drug sensitization targets in an intuitive and cost-efficient manner and can be applied to overcome drug-resistant cells associated with various cancers and other metabolic diseases.">

        <tr id="Next-generation sequencing technology enables uniform and impartial assessment of cancer diagnoses and prognosis. However, such studies are mostly type-specific, and capturing shared genomic abnormalities responsible for neoplastic transformation and progression is a challenging task. Pan-cancer analysis offers insights into the shared and unique molecular mechanisms driving cancer. We conducted an integrated gene-expression analysis using 10,629 samples from 30 distinct cancer types characterized by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A gene co-expression network was constructed and genes overlapping between the selected modules and Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were designated as genes of interest. Following a comprehensive literature review, ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 10 (ABCA10) and ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5) were selected as key candidates for downstream analysis due to the absence of systematic pan-cancer analysis of these genes. This study presents a unique contribution as the first comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of ABCA10 and ABCB5, highlighting their roles in tumor biology and clinical outcomes. We employed a variety of bioinformatics tools to explore the role of these genes across different tumors. Our research demonstrated that ABCA10 shows reduced expression, while ABCB5 displays variable expression patterns across tumors, indicating their opposing roles and flexible functions in pan-cancer. In many cancer patients, these expression patterns are correlated with worse survival outcomes. Furthermore, immunotherapy responses and immune infiltration across a variety of tumor types are associated with the expression levels of both ABCA10 and ABCB5. These results imply that ABCA10 and ABCB5 could serve as valuable predictive markers and potential therapeutic targets across various cancers.">

        <tr id="Background Alternative splicing (AS) is a substantial contributor to the high complexity of transcriptomes in multicellular eukaryotes. Fast chemical reprogramming (FCR) system is an innovative approach that facilitates the rapid transition of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Results In this study, we used the FCR system to delve into the dynamics of AS during cell fate transition. The trajectory of FCR, as characterized by gene expression profiles, consistently aligned with that observed in AS patterns, revealing a complex interplay between AS and gene expression regulation. Additionally, we discovered that the exon exclusion events were more prevalent than the exon inclusion events, indicating a predominant mode of splicing regulation during FCR. Compared to transcription factor-induced reprogramming (TFR), FCR showed a distinct AS pattern, underscoring the unique regulatory mechanisms governing AS in each reprogramming system. Further investigation uncovered polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 3 (Ptbp3) as an important splicing factor, possibly participating in epigenetic regulation in late stage of FCR by affecting AS of epigenetic regulators. Moreover, we found an abundance of intron retention events caused by decrease in spliceosome activity, potentially contributing to the downregulation of key diapause-related genes in the middle and late stages of FCR. Conclusions This research provided a comprehensive characterization of AS during FCR, highlighting the pivotal roles of AS in regulating cell fate transitions. Our findings advanced the understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing cell fate decisions and offered new insights into the potential of FCR for regenerative medicine and therapeutic applications.

        <tr id="In ~70% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the TP53 gene acquires gain-of-function (GOF) mutations leading to rapid disease progression. Specifically, missense p53 (misp53) GOF mutations associate with therapy resistance and worse clinical outcomes. However, the molecular functions of distinct misp53 mutants in plasticity and therapy response remain unclear. Integrating multicenter patient data and multi-omics, we report that the misp53R273H/C mutant is associated with cell cycle progression and a basal-like state compared to the misp53R248W/Q mutant. Loss of misp53R273H/C decreased tumor growth and liver metastasis while prolonging survival in preclinical models. We found that misp53R273H/C specifically regulated the Rb/DREAM axis involved in cell cycle regulation. Notably, a clinical CDK4/6 inhibitor reduced misp53R273H/C mutant expression. However, it triggered MAPK/ERK-mediated resistance mechanisms, enhancing cell survival and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Combining MAPK/ERK and CDK4/6 inhibitors reduced misp53R273H/C-associated oncogenic functions. Thus, distinct misp53 mutants show unique cell-intrinsic plasticity, therapeutic vulnerabilities, and resistance mechanisms.">

 Background:
 Despite advances in therapies, the development of drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) poses a significant challenge. The emergence of neoantigen-based therapies offer a promising new frontier which enhances treatment efficacy and reduces associated costs.
 Methods:
 A total of 24 patients diagnosed with NSCLC were enrolled in this study. Primary tumor tissues and peripheral blood samples were collected from each patient. Paired whole exome and transcriptomic sequencing data were performed to identify somatic mutations and to quantify their respective expression levels. Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions or deletions (inDels) were detected using Strelka algorithm from whole exome sequencing (WES) data. Neoantigen prediction focused on human leukocyte antigens (HLA) type 1. HLA alleles were predicted using WES data encoding adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples, identifying four alleles that were present in at least 50% of the patients. Neoantigens were considered potentially immunogenic if their predicted median IC50 binding scores were ≤500nM while expressed transcripts per million (TPM) exceeds 1 in tumor samples.
 Results:
 Using systematic bioinformatics pipeline, we analyzed 24 NSCLC samples with matched tumor tissues and peripheral blood, and detected the 4677 mutations involving 2442 genes, including 2819 missense SNVs, 941 InDels, 229 gene fusion and 688 RNA alternative splicing events, 94.7% of which (4428 mutations involving in 2247 genes) were common with those reported in the TCGA-LUAD dataset. The average number of mutations was 194.8 in NSCLCs. We found that C>T/G>A transitions/ transversions were dominant. Missense mutations were the most frequent types of somatic mutation in the coding sequence regions. 98% of mutated genes were not detected simultaneously with DNA and RNA mutations.
 ADCK5
 ,
 CD151
 and
 EIF3K
 were identified as potential new driver genes. Genomic variation profiling identified 2213 potential neoantigens with a median IC50 binding score of ≤500nM and a transcript expression level of >1 TPM. Among these, 41 were listed in databases TSNAdb, IEDB, and CTDatabase. A total of 14 genes harboring identical mutations were detected, with the identical mutations observed in over 50% of the patient cohort. Notably, mutations in 14 genes were either gene fusions or RNA alternative splicing events, and core antigenic sequences generated were found to be identical in the majority of patients. Of particular interest is the RPRD2 gene, where an RNA exitrons site was detected in all patient samples, along with the identification of the same neoantigen core sequence.
 Conclusions:
 Our analysis suggests that gene fusions and RNA splicing variations are more likely than point mutations to generate shared antigens, underscoring their importance for developing targeted immunotherapies.

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by expanding clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM) that produce monoclonal immunoglobulin. It is an incurable disease, accounting for about 10% of blood malignancies and the second most common hematologic malignancy. Therefore, in-depth research into the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of the disease is crucial. For the first time, we performed high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi–C) analysis of plasma cells in five multiple myeloma patients, and integrated it with genome resequencing and transcriptomic associated with genomic variation and gene expression. As a result, 19 specific TAD (Topologically Associating Domain) boundaries in MM samples related to the immune response and Wnt signaling pathways were identified. Additionally, Loop structures were also analyzed, revealing that promoter-enhancer-associated loops were the most prevalent. Genomic characteristics of MM patients were explored, identifying SNPs, InDels, and CNVs, with variations in the CDS region potentially affecting gene function. Transcriptome analysis showed differentially expressed genes in MM patients, mainly involved in p53 signaling and cell adhesion. Multi-omics analysis identified overlapping genes related to MM, including those involved in MHC class II protein complex assembly and antigen presentation. The study provides insights into the complex genomic and transcriptomic changes in MM plasma cells, potentially aiding in identifying therapeutic targets.

 Background:
 Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most common lung cancer subtype, has poor survival rates and limited treatment options. Among its molecular drivers, loss of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is linked to aggressive development and poor outcomes, yet its downstream effects remain unclear. MTAP is essential for purine biosynthesis and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) production, a key methyl donor for epigenetic regulation. MTAP-loss leads to methylthioadenosine (MTA) accumulation, which inhibits methyltransferase activity and disrupts epigenetic control. However, the impact of MTAP deficiency on transcriptional and metabolic programming in LUAD is still largely unknown, highlighting a critical gap for targeted therapy. This study examines these molecular consequences to identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in MTAP-deficient LUAD.
 Methods:
 RNA-sequencing data for 510 LUAD samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) via cBioPortal. Samples were classified as MTAP-loss (n=64) or MTAP-normal (n=446) based on mutational data. Differential gene expression was performed using the DESeq2 package for R and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to control for false discovery rate. DNA methylation (Illumina Human Methylation 450k) was compared between MTAP-loss (n=46) and MTAP-normal (n=404) cohorts. Significantly altered probes were mapped to differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Pathway and gene ontology (GO) analyses were conducted using KEGG, GO, and EnrichR to identify dysregulated pathways.
 Results:
 DNA methylation analysis revealed 581 hypomethylated and only 51 hypermethylated probes in MTAP-loss samples, underscoring a global hypomethylation phenotype likely driven by MTA accumulation. We identified 343 differentially expressed, hypomethylated genes in MTAP-loss LUAD samples. Of these, upregulated genes were highly enriched in mitochondrial function and stress response pathways, whereas downregulated genes were linked to cell differentiation and developmental processes, suggesting an epigenetically driven metabolic reprogramming. Notably, these alterations may confer heightened cellular survival and adaptability under stress, while curtailing normal differentiation programs.
 Conclusions:
 Our findings indicate that MTAP loss in LUAD leads to a coordinated shift in DNA methylation and gene expression, promoting survival-focused metabolic and stress responses at the expense of normal regulatory pathways. These results highlight novel vulnerabilities in MTAP-deficient tumors and suggest potential targets for precision therapies.

        <tr id="Background Molecular genetic diagnoses are critical to prevention and treatment of inherited polyposis and colorectal cancer. 19 genes responsible for these conditions are known, but many severely affected patients and families remain unsolved. Cryptic intronic variants that alter splicing of these genes and incomplete characterisation of recessive predisposition contribute to these diagnostic gaps. Methods Adaptive sampling long-read DNA sequencing targeted to 19 colon cancer genes, paired with direct long-read RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing, was undertaken for four patients referred for deficiency of mismatch repair proteins and/or familial polyposis, for whom multigene panel testing yielded negative or uncertain germline results. Results Genetic diagnoses were obtained for all four patients. Each patient carried a cryptic intronic germline variant in a different colon cancer gene. The variants abrogated splicing by various mechanisms, all leading to loss of gene function. Patient 1 was heterozygous for intronic insertion into MSH2 of an Alu element, leading to extension of transcription into the affected intron and a stop. Patient 2 was heterozygous for deep intronic insertion into APC of a Long Interspersed Nuclear Element (LINE), creating a pseudoexon and a stop. Patient 3 was compound heterozygous at MLH3, including a cryptic intronic substitution leading to exon skipping and a stop. Patient 4 was compound heterozygous at MUTYH, including a deep intronic deletion yielding an extremely short intron and transcriptional loss of an exon encoding a critical protein domain. Conclusion Paired long-read DNA and RNA sequencing can enhance diagnostic yield through detection of cryptic intronic variants that impact cancer predisposition.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating malignancy with a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of approximately 12%. More than 90% of PDAC patients harbor oncogenic mutations in the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral homolog (KRAS) gene. MRTX1133 (MRTX), a novel inhibitor of KRASG12D (the most common KRAS mutation found in pancreatic and colon cancers) has shown promise as a therapeutic agent. To address reported resistance to MRTX, we adapted our anti-leukemia co-targeting strategy and evaluated a combination of MRTX and Bedaquiline (BED), an FDA-approved inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP production, in in vitro human PDAC models. The combination of MRTX and BED demonstrated enhanced cytotoxic effects by disrupting all 11 genes within the DNA helicase family (CMG complex: CDC45-MCM-GINS), which are essential for initiating DNA replication and regulating cell cycle progression. Notably, real-world data analysis from Caris Life Sciences and NCI-TCGA database revealed that low transcriptomic expression of the DNA helicase CMG complex was significantly associated with prolonged survival (e.g., low CDC45 expression and low GINS2 expression with greater than 8 months longer overall survival) in PDAC patients with KRASG12 mutations (N = 9,717; P < 0.00001). However, this combination therapy also triggered strong pro-survival nuclear reprogramming. This effect was mediated by significant genetic activation of an NFκB2-DDIT (DNA damage-induced transcript) axis, which supported tumor chromosomal integrity and DNA repair mechanisms. To overcome NFκB2-driven resistance mechanisms, we explored a triple-targeting strategy that addresses metabolic and genomic plasticity in addition to actively intercepting cell division. This approach combines MRTX1133, Bedaquiline, and the NFκB2 inhibitor SN52, offering a novel therapeutic avenue to treat aggressive pancreatic cancer and potentially improve patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Comprehensive genomic analysis is essential for advancing our understanding of human genetics and disease. However, short-read sequencing technologies are inherently limited in their ability to resolve highly repetitive, structurally complex, and low-mappability genomic regions, previously coined as “dark” regions. Long-read sequencing technologies, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), offer improved resolution of these regions, yet they are not perfect. With the advent of the new Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) CHM13 reference genome, exploring its effect on dark regions is prudent. In this study, we systematically analyze dark regions across four human genome references—HG19, HG38 (with and without alternate contigs), and CHM13—using both short- and long-read sequencing data. We found that dark regions increase as the reference becomes more complete, especially dark-by-MAPQ regions, but that long-read sequencing significantly reduces the number of dark regions in the genome, particularly within gene bodies. However, we identify potential alignment challenges in long-read data, such as centromeric regions. These findings highlight the importance of both reference genome selection and sequencing technology choice in achieving a truly comprehensive genomic analysis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Despite extensive research efforts, glioblastoma (GBM) remains a deadly disease with poor prognosis. Although previous studies have identified various cell states within GBM tumors, the molecular mechanism underlying adaptive GBM cell plasticity induced by conventional therapy remains unclear.


METHODS
We used fluorescent reporters for proneural (PN) and mesenchymal (MES) subtypes to monitor GBM cell plasticity in real-time across multiple patient-derived cell lines. This approach revealed cells that concurrently expressed both proneural and mesenchymal markers. To investigate this unique hybrid population, we implemented a comprehensive methodological approach encompassing bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell ChIP sequencing, nuclear proteomics, high-resolution imaging, orthotopic mouse models, clinical dataset analysis, and pharmacological and genetic techniques. This multifaceted strategy allowed us to gain functional and molecular insights into this distinct cellular population.


RESULTS
We showed that these hybrid cells are increased by conventional therapies, and are resistant to these therapies. At the molecular level, hybrid cells display significant alterations in chromatin structure and nuclear protein composition, elevated transcriptional activity, Myc activation, and improved transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Genetic and pharmaceutical inhibition of the nuclear import/export shuttling machinery, increased in hybrid cells, effectively suppressed adaptive GBM cell plasticity and hybrid identity, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of GBM cells to therapies.


CONCLUSION
Our results indicate that GBM hybrid cells play a crucial role in chemoradiation resistance. The nuclear transport machinery presents a potential therapeutic target for hybrid cells, offering a way to counteract the typical resistance to treatment observed in GBM.">

        <tr id="This study investigated whether therapeutic X-ray doses can affect the expression of mismatch repair (MMR) genes and proteins using Lynch syndrome-associated human colorectal cancer cell lines. MMR-deficient cell lines (HCT116, SW48, LoVo) and an MMR-proficient control cell line (HT29) were exposed to X rays [a 2 Gy dose or 2 Gy daily for five consecutive days (10 Gy)]. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting were used to detect the radiation-induced changes in the expression of RNAs and proteins, respectively. RT-qPCR revealed that MLH1 and MSH6 genes were stably expressed regardless of the MMR status of the cell line and the radiation dose. In contrast, the MSH2 gene was either up-regulated or down-regulated after 2 Gy or 10 Gy or both. The expression of PMS2 increased after 10 Gy irradiation in all MMR-deficient cell lines, even though the data were not statistically significant compared to other doses, except for the LoVo cell line. Protein expression analysed using Western blotting demonstrated that MLH1 protein expression was stable, whereas the expression of MSH2 was significantly affected by radiation exposure in both MLH1-deficient cell lines. No correlation between the expression of RNA and protein could be identified. In conclusion, radiation may have significantly differential effects on MMR RNA and protein expression when different cell lines, doses, and specific genes are considered.">

        <tr id="Activation of oncogenes, such as through mutations in Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), triggers profound disruptions in cellular homeostasis that set off a cascade of stress responses. These responses enable cells to cope with the array of challenges encountered during tumorigenesis by activating defense mechanisms that promote adaptation and survival. Key components of this oncogenic stress response include heat shock proteins, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2–antioxidant response element signaling, DNA damage response proteins, p53, redox-regulating proteins, and stress granules. This review concentrates on KRAS-driven oncogenic transformation, as KRAS mutations are among the most common in human cancers, accounting for over 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cases, around 30% of lung cancers, and approximately 50% of colorectal cancers. We examine the intricate molecular interplay between oncogenic stress and the associated cellular defense mechanisms, emphasizing the key molecular events that follow KRAS activation. Importantly, the very pathways that allow cancer cells to adapt to oncogenic stress also offer novel therapeutic opportunities. By selectively targeting pivotal regulators within these stress response pathways, we can potentially disrupt the survival mechanisms of cancer cells. This strategy not only promises to enhance the effectiveness of existing treatments but also paves the way for the development of innovative therapies designed to combat tumor progression. In essence, exploiting oncogenic stress responses represents an original and promising therapeutic approach in the fight against cancer.">

        <tr id="
 Breast cancer pathogenesis is closely linked to the mechanisms of cellular reprogramming, the process of converting differentiated cells into undifferentiated or different cell types. This reprogramming is achieved through the orchestrated expression of transcription factors which alter the cell’s existing chromatin landscape and establish a transcriptome corresponding to the reprogrammed cell state. Pioneer factors, a type of transcription factor, initiate cell development and cell fate transition by binding to specific DNA motifs within nucleosomes. This binding leads to the recruitment of co-factors, such as nucleosome remodelers, leading to chromatin opening and subsequent activation of specific genes essential for reprogrammed cell function. Improper engagement of these factors can lead to unanticipated or harmful gene expression, potentially contributing to various human diseases, including cancer. GATA3, a pioneer factor, is essential for normal mammary gland development and differentiation. In breast cancer cells, GATA3 has been shown to suppress tumor growth by inducing mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), the reverse process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Interestingly, although mutations in GATA3 are frequent and considered driver mutations, breast cancer patients carrying GATA3 mutations are generally associated with better patient survival. The roles of these mutations remain largely unexplored. M294R and M294K are hot spot missense mutations found in luminal breast cancer patients. These mutations occur in the DNA-binding domain of GATA3, which is crucial for its function as a transcription factor. For functional characterization of these mutants, we utilized MDA-MB-231 mesenchymal cells, a highly aggressive and invasive breast cancer cell line to model mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Since ectopic expression of GATA3 induces MET in this cell line, these cells provide an excellent system to observe phenotypic and molecular alterations caused by its missense mutations M294R/K. To quantitatively measure changes in GATA3 mobility and its DNA binding dynamics in living cells, we utilized Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) assay. Additionally, to further elucidate the crucial role of GATA3, genomics analyses and phenotypic assays were conducted. Functional characterization of M294R/K mutants in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells demonstrated distinct phenotypic and molecular alterations compared to wild-type GATA3. While wild-type GATA3 induced MET, mutant-expressing cells exhibited differential responses. Remarkably, mutants derived from breast cancer patients displayed increased chromatin binding, leading to a tighter chromatin structure and differential gene expression of mesenchymal or epithelial markers. Altered cellular phenotypes such as cell migration are also observed in M294R/K expressed cells. Our finding underscores the importance of precise regulation of pioneer factor-chromatin interactions in cellular reprogramming processes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying GATA3 mutations and their effects on cellular reprogramming in breast cancer provides valuable insights into the roles of GATA3 in breast cancer progression.

        <tr id="The evolution of techniques used to identify structural variants (SVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) in genomes have seen significant development in the last decade. With the growing use of more technologies including chromosomal microarray, genome sequencing and genome mapping in clinical cytogenetics laboratories, reporting the frequency of SVs and CNVs has increased the complexity of genomic results. In conventional testing (e.g. karyotype or FISH) individual cells are analyzed and abnormalities are reported at the single cell level directly as a proportion of the analyzed cells. Whereas for bulk genome assays structural and sequence changes are often reported as variant allele frequencies and fractional copy number states. The International System of Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN) recommends converting these values into a “proportion of the sample”, which requires different calculations and underlying assumptions based on the data type. This review illustrates how the different methods of interpreting and reporting data are performed and identifies challenges in the conversion of these values to a proportion of the sample. We stress the need for careful interpretation of data with consideration for factors that may alter how proportions are reported including overlapping SVs and CNVs or regions with acquired homozygosity. We also demonstrate, using validation data of SVs and CNVs tested by multiple techniques how results are largely consistent across methodologies, but can show dramatic differences in rare circumstances. This review focuses on illustrating many of the challenges with aligning reporting using different techniques and their underlying assumptions. As hematologic disease classifications start to incorporate numeric limits (e.g. VAF defining thresholds), it is important for laboratory geneticists, pathologists and clinicians to appreciate the differences in methodologies, potential pitfalls and the nuances when comparing bulk genome analyses to the more conventional single cell techniques.">

Therefore, we performed whole genome and transcriptome analysis of 39 well differentiated siNET samples. Our genomic data revealed a lack of recurrent driver mutations and demonstrated that multifocal siNETs from individual patients can arise genetically independently. We detected germline mutations in Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway (FANC) genes, involved in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair, in 9% of patients and found mutational signatures of defective HR DNA repair in late-stage tumor evolution. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed low expression of the transcriptional repressor REST. Summarizing, we identify a novel common transcriptomic signature of siNETs and demonstrate that genomic alterations alone do not explain initial tumor formation, while impaired DNA repair likely contributes to tumor evolution and represents a potential pharmaceutical target in a subset of patients.">

        <tr id="Cancer progression and development are influenced by a complex interplay between inherited (germline) and acquired (somatic) mutations. Current cancer genomic research in Middle Eastern populations predominantly utilizes targeted panels to examine predefined genes, potentially overlooking a broader spectrum of genomic contributions to cancer predisposition. Addressing this gap, this study adopts an unbiased approach using whole exome sequencing (WES) data to identify both high- and low-penetrance genetic variants within the United Arab Emirates (UAE) population. This investigation features a case-control matching analysis comprising 62 patients diagnosed with various cancer types and 142 unrelated healthy controls. The results showed a potential association between cancer predisposition and variants within. The results demonstrate an association between cancer predisposition and variants within C-terminal Binding Protein 2 (CTBP2), DNA Polymerase Theta (POLQ) and Tektin 4 (TEKT4). Gene set enrichment analysis showed enriched pathways associated with cancer-related biological processes such as DNA repair and depleted pathways related to translation, cellular metabolic process, and mitochondrial functions. This study highlights that the distinctive genetic composition of underrepresented groups influences the penetrance of pathogenic variants that could contribute to hereditary cancer risk in ways that diverge from patterns observed in more extensively researched cohorts.

This study investigates how mutation-specific transcriptional responses influence susceptibility to PM2.5-induced oncogenic alterations, focusing on A549 and NCI-H1975 cells. This provides preliminary insight into the transcriptomic effects of acute PM2.5 exposure in NSCLC cells with distinct oncogenic mutations (A549 and NCI-H1975), serving as a guide for understanding mutation-specific responses to environmental stress. Cells were exposed to PM2.5 (200 µg/mL, 24 h), followed by RNA sequencing and analysis. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to identify key molecular alterations associated with tumour progression. NCI-H1975 cells exhibited a stronger transcriptional response, with a higher fold change in differentially expressed genes (DEGs), indicating greater PM2.5 susceptibility. Upregulated genes were linked to oxidative stress, carcinogen activation, metabolic reprogramming, and therapy resistance, reinforcing tumour survival under PM2.5 stress. Conversely, the downregulation of tumour suppressor genes suggests immune suppression and potential immunotherapy resistance. This study reveals that acute PM2.5 exposure induces mutation-specific transcriptomic alterations in NSCLC, with EGFR-mutant cells exhibiting heightened oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and immune evasion. The upregulation of key genes highlights the profound molecular impact of short-term exposure, paving the way for future studies on pollution-driven oncogenic mechanisms and resistance pathways.">

 How do gene expression, signaling pathways and cell-cell communication differ in the endometrium of patients with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) compared to fertile controls?



 Significant alterations in gene expression, signaling pathways, and cell-cell communication have been identified in the endometrial epithelial, stromal and natural killer (NK) cells of RIF.



 Currently, 10% of women undergoing assisted reproductive technology experience RIF. The causes of RIF are complex and multifactorial. Advancements in sequencing technology allows the identification of associated molecular signatures. RNA sequencing studies failed to identify a consistent transcriptomic profile for endometrium of RIF patients, however traditional sequencing methods overlook the heterogeneity between different cell types and fail to explore cell-cell communication. Currently, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is being used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in specific cell types and cell-cell communication, providing a better understanding of endometrial function and dysfunction.



 This study utilized bioinformatic reanalysis of publicly available human endometrium scRNA-seq datasets. The inclusion criteria of datasets were: (1) scRNA-seq technology; (2) endometrial biopsy from RIF patients (≥3 failed transfers of ≥ 4 good-quality embryos) or fertile women endometrium; (3) biopsy taken in the mid-secretory phase (LH + 6-8 days). Finally, four published datasets were eligible for analysis. A total of nine samples from RIF patients and seven samples from fertile women were integrated for downstream analysis.



 Raw data were obtained from the GEO database and aligned to the human reference genome by the STAR algorithm. Quantification and quality control were performed with the Cell Ranger software. Seurat was utilized to identify cell types, cell proportion and DEGs. Disease-related functions and signaling pathways were determined through GO and KEGG. Additionally, the intercellular communication between stromal cells, unciliated epithelial cells and lymphocytes was inferred using “Cellchat” to uncover differences between patients’ groups.



 The integrated scRNA-seq data initially identified six cell types: epithelial cells (ciliated and unciliated), stromal fibroblasts, lymphocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells. The proportion of stromal fibroblasts was the largest (65.9%), followed by unciliated epithelial cells (20.9%), with ciliated epithelial cells making up the smallest proportion (1.1%). No significant differences were observed in the proportion of each cell type between RIF and healthy endometrium. Six DEGs (PAEP, CXCL14, GPX3, SOD2, LINCO1619, and LINCO0513) were decreased and ELP3 was increased in unciliated epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts and NK cells. Interestingly, an unciliated epithelial cluster was identified in fertile controls (84.7%) but was minimally present in RIF (0.02%), characterized by high expression of PAEP, CXCL14 and MAP2K6 and low expression of EPCAM. Furthermore, GO and KEGG analysis revealed that macroautophagy and metabolic process were highly associated with RIF in unciliated epithelial cells. Notably, the NK cells population, a subset of the lymphocytes, was decreased in RIF (p < 0.05). Significant DEGs were associated with enriched lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. Moreover, aberrant cell-cell communication was found in RIF, characterized by significantly reduced expression of key ligand-receptor pairs, such as CXCL8/CXCL2-ACKR1 and ANXA1-FPR1 in unciliated epithelial cell-stromal fibroblasts and epithelial cell-lymphocytes communication.



 Given the high heterogeneity of the human endometrium, our study is limited by the small sample size (9 RIF and 7 control samples). Additionally, due to the lack of a consistent definition of RIF, the selection and inclusion of RIF samples should be done with caution.



 Understanding the molecular landscape of RIF at the single-cell level will help identify its pathogenesis and potentially uncover diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Exploring dynamic cell-cell interactions enhances our understanding of complex intercellular communication in vivo, providing guidance for building in vitro models to better comprehend the mechanisms underlying endometrial function.

Here we describe sci-L3-Strand-seq, a combinatorial indexing method with linear amplification for DNA template strand sequencing that cost-effectively scales to millions of single cells. We provide a computational framework to fully leverage the throughput, as well as the relatively sparse but multifaceted genotype information within each cell that includes strandedness, digital counting of copy numbers, and haplotype-aware chromosome segmentation, to systematically distinguish seven possible types of mitotic crossover outcomes and resulting genome instability. We showcase the power of sci-L3-Strand-seq by quantifying the rates of error-free and mutational crossovers in thousands of cells, enabling us to explore enrichment patterns of genomic and epigenomic features. The throughput of sci-L3-Strand-seq also gave us the ability to measure subtle phenotypes, opening the door for future large mutational screens. Furthermore, mapping clonal lineages provided insights into the temporal order of certain genome instability events, showcasing the potential to dissect cancer evolution. Altogether, we show the wide applicability of sci-L3-Strand-seq to the study of DNA repair, structural variations, and genome instability in disease.">

        <tr id="DEAD-box helicase 41 (DDX41) is implicated in germline (GL)-predisposed myeloid neoplasms, where pathogenic GL variants often lead to disease following the acquisition of a somatic variant in trans, most commonly p.R525H. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which DDX41 variants contribute to the pathogenesis of myeloid neoplasms remain poorly understood, partly due to challenges in establishing cellular and animal models that faithfully recapitulate the human disease phenotype. This limitation highlights the necessity of directly analyzing primary human disease cells. In this case report, conducted to pursue this objective, we implemented single-cell RNA sequencing integrated with genotyping at the p.R525 locus in a myelodysplastic neoplasm (MDS) harboring both germline and somatic DDX41 variants, leveraging highly efficient Terminator-Assisted Solid-phase cDNA amplification and sequencing. We found that acquiring p.R525H induced G2/M cell cycle arrest selectively in colony-forming unit-erythroid cells, accompanied by R-loop accumulation, which impaired erythropoiesis through DNA damage. In hematopoietic stem and myeloid progenitor populations, gene expression profiles were largely similar between p.R525H-positive and -negative cells. However, ligand-receptor interaction and transcriptional regulation analyses suggested a non-cell-autonomous influence from p.R525H-expressing cells on GL variant-only cells. This interaction drove convergence toward a shared expression profile, highlighting an intricate interplay shaping the patient’s MDS phenotype.">

Here we perform combined DNA methylation, RNA-sequencing, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 profiling across metastatic lesions from patients with CRPC/NEPC. Integrative analyses identify DNA methylation-driven gene links based on location (H3K27ac, H3K27me3, promoters, gene bodies) pointing to mechanisms underlying dysregulation of genes involved in tumor lineage (ASCL1, AR) and therapeutic targets (PSMA, DLL3, STEAP1, B7-H3).

        <tr id="Alternative splicing (AS) is a pivotal post-transcriptional mechanism that expands the functional diversity of the proteome by enabling a single gene to generate multiple mRNA and protein isoforms. This process, which involves the differential inclusion or exclusion of exons and introns, is tightly regulated by splicing factors (SFs), such as serine/arginine-rich proteins (SRs), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), and RNA-binding motif (RBM) proteins. These factors recognize specific sequences, including 5′ and 3′ splice sites and branch points, to ensure precise splicing. While AS is essential for normal cellular function, its dysregulation is increasingly implicated in cancer pathogenesis. Aberrant splicing can lead to the production of oncogenic isoforms that promote tumorigenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Furthermore, such abnormalities can cause the loss of tumor-suppressing activity, thereby contributing to cancer development. Importantly, abnormal AS events can generate neoantigens, which are presented on tumor cell surfaces via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, suggesting novel targets for cancer immunotherapy. Additionally, splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) have shown promise as therapeutic agents because they modulate splicing patterns to restore normal gene function or induce tumor-suppressive isoforms. This review explores the mechanisms of AS dysregulation in cancer, its role in tumor progression, and its potential as a therapeutic target. We also discuss innovative technologies, such as high-throughput sequencing and computational approaches, that are revolutionizing the study of AS in cancer. Finally, we address the challenges and future prospects of targeting AS for personalized cancer therapies, emphasizing its potential in precision medicine.">

 Background:
 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy marked by abnormal proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells, often leading to poor outcomes and high relapse rates. While the genetic underpinnings of AML are well-documented, the role of immune dysregulation in its progression remains underexplored. This study integrates whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome analysis to identify genetic mutations, transcriptional alterations, and immune regulatory disruptions, with a focus on their contributions to hematopoiesis and immune dysfunction.
 Methods:
 WES and RNA sequencing were performed on 10 AML patient samples to investigate somatic mutations, differential gene expression, and immune-related pathways. WES data were analyzed to detect mutations in AML-associated genes, while transcriptomic analysis compared gene expression profiles between AML cells and normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Bioinformatic tools, including differential expression analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and pathway mapping, were employed to identify key regulatory networks. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was conducted to assess cellular heterogeneity and differentiation dynamics, with a focus on immune cell subsets and pathways involved in immune evasion.
 Results:
 Analysis revealed recurrent mutations and dysregulation in genes critical to hematopoiesis, apoptosis, and immune regulation, including
 RUNX1, FLT3, CEBPA, TP53, WT1, GATA2,
 and
 TET2
 . Transcriptomic profiling highlighted distinct gene expression patterns in AML cells, with significant disruption in cell cycle control, differentiation, and apoptosis. Dysregulated immune pathways, such as IL-7R and PD-1, were identified as key contributors to immune cell activation impairment and immune tolerance. scRNA-seq data provided insights into the cellular heterogeneity of AML, uncovering altered lineage differentiation and immune subset composition, which may facilitate immune evasion and disease progression.
 Conclusions:
 This integrative analysis illuminates the interplay between genetic mutations, transcriptional dysregulation, and immune dysfunction in AML. The findings underscore the pivotal role of immune pathways, such as IL-7R and PD-1, in AML pathogenesis, presenting them as potential therapeutic targets. By linking genetic and immune alterations, this study advances our understanding of AML biology and highlights the need for therapies addressing both genetic and immune dysfunctions to improve clinical outcomes.

Understanding these changes may provide new insights into tumorigenesis and potential therapeutic targets. This study focuses on the evolutionary transcriptomics of cancer, specifically analyzing the Transcriptome Age Index (TAI) across different pathological stages. By examining various cancers at four distinct pathological stages, we identify a significant «hourglass» pattern in TAI indices of ductal carcinoma of the breast, bladder carcinoma, and liver carcinoma, suggesting a conserved evolutionary trajectory during tumor development. The results reveal that early and late stages of these cancers exhibit higher TAI values, indicative of more novel gene expression, while intermediate stages show a dip in TAI, reflecting a more ancient evolutionary origin of expressed genes. This «hourglass» pattern underscores the evolutionary constraints and innovations at play during tumor progression. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that evolutionary principles are deeply embedded in cancer biology, offering new perspectives on the dynamics of gene expression in tumors.">

Once considered rare anomalies, eccDNAs are now recognized as major drivers of oncogene amplification, genomic plasticity, and therapeutic resistance, particularly in cancer. EccDNA subtypes such as microDNA, double minutes, and ecDNA are defined by their structural, genomic, and pathological features. EccDNAs originate through diverse mechanisms including DNA repair, chromothripsis, breakage fusion bridge cycles, and apoptosis, occurring in both normal and stressed cells. Advances in long-read and single-cell sequencing, CRISPR-based synthesis, and computational tools have improved detection and functional analysis. Functionally, eccDNAs contribute to transcriptional amplification, activate immune responses through cGAS-STING signaling, and facilitate intercellular communication. They are found across a range of tissues and disease states—including cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, autoimmune, and metabolic disorders—and serve as both biomarkers and regulatory elements. We introduce the concept of the stress selection theory, which proposes eccDNA as an adaptive reservoir that enhances cellular fitness in response to environmental and therapeutic pressures. Despite growing insights, challenges remain in understanding tissue-specific roles, achieving clinical translation, and standardizing methodologies. Emerging tools in multi-omics, spatial biology, and artificial intelligence are expected to drive future breakthroughs in precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Cancer initiation occurs when a cell acquires and accumulates mutations in genes involved in the regulation of cell processes: each cell division throughout a person’s life introduces novel mutations in the cells’ DNA and under normal circumstances, the body is primed to prevent those from leading to cancer. Occasionally, a subset of those mutations escapes those safeguards and might eventually result in the emergence of the disease. To understand the dynamics of accumulation of somatic mutations, we have performed longitudinal whole genome sequencing of DNA obtained from whole blood from healthy individuals and cancer patients using Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ Long Read Sequencing. Here we show that the number of somatic single nucleotide variants detected increases with their age and that for specific mutational processes, changes can be detected within months. We computed aggregated metrics for unique participants at each timepoint across types of variants (based on single based substitution molecular signatures) and identified patterns of change both over an individual’s lifespan (age) and over the sampling period (months). This study showcases the suitability of long read sequencing of blood DNA for detecting coarse-grained differences over time and enable future development of “state of the system” personalized prevention programs.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Aneuploidy is near-ubiquitous in cancer and can decrease chemotherapy efficacy while also sensitizing cells to other drugs. Methods: To systematically identify treatment strategies that target aneuploid cancers, data were integrated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; 10,967 samples, 16,948 aneuploidy events) and the Broad Institute’s Profiling Relative Inhibition Simultaneously in Mixtures (PRISM) screen of 578 cancer cell lines and 4518 compounds. Results: Our analyses uncovered 37,720 significant positive and negative associations linking specific aneuploidies and treatments with patient prognosis or cell viability. Within TCGA data, 22 treatments correlated with improved 5-year survival for specific aneuploid cancers, whereas 46 were linked to worse outcomes. A complementary analysis of PRISM identified 17,946 compound–aneuploidy associations and 16,189 mechanism of action (MOA)–aneuploidy associations. Pathway-altering compounds that selectively reduce viability in cells with aneuploidy profiles were discovered, including an unexpectedly prominent number of glucocorticoid receptor agonists. Conclusions: This integrated dataset provides a resource for designing therapeutic decision hypotheses, identifying drug-repurposing opportunities, and informing future studies aimed at targeting aneuploidy-induced vulnerabilities in cancer.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis of CRC primarily stems from the gradual accumulation of genetic mutations, which drive oncogene (e.g., KRAS) activation and tumor suppressor gene (e.g., TP53) inactivation. Loss of genetic stability facilitates the conversion of proto-oncogenes into active oncogenes and the functional impairment of tumor suppressors, collectively propelling CRC progression. The tumor suppressor protein p53, a transcription factor, induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair under cellular stress, and prevents cancer development by regulating various cellular responses. However, in CRC pathogenesis, TP53 mutations (detected in ~ 74% of cases) subvert these protective mechanisms through dual mechanisms: (i) dominant-negative suppression of wild-type p53 (wt-p53) function, and (ii) acquisition of neomorphic pro-tumorigenic activities, termed gain-of-function (GOF) mutations. New evidence from laboratory and clinical trials shows that some new therapeutic strategies have the potential to treat CRC by reactivating and restoring p53 function, depleting p53 mutants, or targeting p53 with immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the function of p53 and characterize its mutation in CRC, emphasizing the influence of p53 mutation in the pathogenesis of CRC. In addition, we also describe the current therapeutic strategies for targeting p53 mutants in CRC.">

        <tr id="Despite advancements in cancer therapy, clinical options remain limited and therapeutic resistance inevitably develops. In melanoma, the second most commonly mutated driver oncogene is neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) which remains undruggable by small molecular agents. For those treated with BRAF/MEK combination therapy, in the setting of V600 BRAF mutations, or immunotherapies regardless of somatic genetic make-up, resistance eventually develops in the majority of cases. Developing rational combination therapies, as suggested by preclinical studies involving genetic manipulation of resistance mediators, necessitates a substantial expansion of druggable targets. Novel chemistry strategies, such as chemoproteomics platforms and chemical inducer of proximity (CIP) agents, offer promising solutions. Chemoproteomics enables the rapid identification of ligands to guide medicinal chemistry, while CIP agents alter the expression levels of key proteins. Using oncogene (such as NRAS) and p53 as pivotal resistance mediators, and the lineage-specific transcription factor SRY-box transcription factor 10 [SOX10]) in melanoma as illustrative examples, we demonstrate how these technologies can be leveraged to rapidly expand the druggable target pool and overcome resistance mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for regimens that produce deeper and more durable responses.">

        <tr id="Short tandem repeats (STRs) are repetitive DNA sequences that contribute to genetic diversity and play a significant role in disease susceptibility. The human genome contains approximately 1.5 million STR loci, collectively covering around 3% of the total sequence. Certain repeat expansions can significantly impact cellular function by altering protein synthesis, impairing DNA repair, and leading to neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. Traditional short-read sequencing struggles to accurately characterize STRs due to its limited read length, which limits the ability to resolve repeat expansions, increases mapping errors, and reduces sensitivity for detecting large insertions or interruptions. This review examines how long-read sequencing technologies, particularly Oxford Nanopore and PacBio, overcome these limitations by enabling direct sequencing of full STR regions with improved accuracy. We discuss challenges in sequencing, bioinformatics workflows, and the latest computational tools for STR detection. Additionally, we highlight the strengths and limitations of different methods, providing deeper insight into the future of STR genotyping.">

This study aimed to identify commonly mutated genes and altered pathways in canine solid tumors. Four dogs with different types of naturally occurring neoplasias (urothelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma) were randomly selected and classified into carcinoma and sarcoma groups based on histopathological findings. Tumor tissues were analyzed using whole-genome sequencing, and significant variants shared within each tumor group were identified. Gene set enrichment analyses were conducted to compare the biological and functional pathways altered by the mutations in each carcinoma and sarcoma group. Forty-three and fifty-eight genes were identified in the carcinoma and sarcoma groups, respectively. Distinctions between the two tumor groups were noted for mutations related to tumor metastatic function. Mutations were identified in genes encoding cell adhesion molecules in the carcinoma group, whereas significant variations in extracellular matrix-related molecules were evident in the sarcoma group. This study revealed mutations and modified pathways associated with immune and tumor metastatic functions in canine carcinoma and sarcoma, indicating their significant relevance to the development and progression of each tumor group. Additionally, the distinctions indicated that different therapeutic approaches were required for each tumor group.">

        <tr id="Globally, gastric cancer (GC) stands as the fifth most prevalent form of malignant neoplasm and represents a significant contributor to mortality associated with oncological conditions. Despite advancements in therapeutic strategies for GC, the outcomes for patients with advanced stages of the disease continue to be unfavorable, largely due to tumor heterogeneity and the challenges posed by resistance to therapeutic agents. Metabolic reprogramming is pivotal in driving the advancement of GC, contributing to the development of resistance to pharmacological treatments and facilitating the cancer’s ability to evade immune surveillance. Developing multi-target comprehensive treatment strategies by integrating tumor microenvironment (TME) modulation holds promise for significantly improving therapeutic efficacy.The study analyzed GC and identified key cell subtypes by integrating data derived from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) alongside spatial transcriptomics information. Cell type identification was accomplished using the tool of Seurat, and the spatial distribution of cell types was revealed through the Robust Cell Type Decomposition technique. CellChat was used to analyze the interactions between key cell subtypes and other cells, and the “StLearn” package was employed to investigate spatial cell communication in depth. Additionally, the functional role of the key molecule ELK4 was validated through in vitro experiments.This research utilized scRNA-seq combined with spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively analyze GC, identifying the C1 NDUFAB1+ subtype, which exhibited high proliferative activity, metabolic reprogramming capabilities, and immune evasion properties. It was found that the C1 NDUFAB1+ subtype closely interacted with fibroblasts and pericytes via the PARs signaling pathway. Additionally, in vitro experiments confirmed that knockdown of ELK4 substantially curbed tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.This study revealed the main significance of the C1 NDUFAB1+ subtype in GC, elucidating its core mechanisms in tumor progression, metabolic reprogramming, and immune evasion. ELK4 was identified as a key regulatory factor that markedly enhanced the proliferation, migratory capacity, and invasive potential of tumor cells, while changes in the TME were a driving force behind immune suppression and drug resistance. The findings underscored the importance of developing specific therapeutic targets, targeting metabolic reprogramming, and overcoming immune evasion, providing new theoretical foundations.">

        <tr id="Background Transcriptomic and genomic analyses of bladder cancer (BC) reveal a highly diverse disease stratified into molecular subtypes with distinct molecular features and biological behaviors. Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and plasticity can significantly impact diagnosis and patient management, yet their extent in BC remains highly debated. Here, we investigated whether the three main bladder cancer subtypes maintain or alter their identity in response to changes in the microenvironment and during metastatic colonization. Methods Seven patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representing the major BC subtypes were propagated into three distinct tissue microenvironments: subcutaneous, mammary fat pad and under the kidney capsule. Metastatic lesions were generated via systemic injection of tumor cells. Tumor samples were analysed using RNA- and exome sequencing, SNP-arrays and histopathology to assess subtype fidelity, genomic evolution, and clonal dynamics. Results A comprehensive, longitudinal multiomics analysis showed that tumors consistently maintain their molecular subtype, as well as their transcriptomic and genomic profiles, across different environments. No evidence of emerging ITH or subtype transitions was observed, regardless of the microenvironment. The transcriptomic adaptations observed in metastases and different implantation sites are limited and are associated primarily with hypoxia, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and invasion. Conclusions Our results suggest that invasive bladder cancers have a strong intrinsic tumor identity that is not easily reprogrammed by the microenvironment.

 Introduction: Survival rates for patients with breast cancer have improved significantly with widespread screening and effective systemic therapies. However, patients who present with advanced nodal stage at diagnosis have higher rates of distant relapse and require more aggressive therapies than patients with pathologic N1 disease (pN1). Understanding the molecular alterations that occur in primary breast cancer (BC) that drive progression to a higher nodal stage (>pN1) could uncover potential therapeutic targets for patients with regionally metastatic BC. Given that epigenetic mechanisms represent that crucial layer of dynamic change that regulates genome-wide gene expression, we assessed the DNA methylation profiles of primary BC at various nodal stages. Methods: We conducted an exploratory study using a well-annotated, retrospective cohort of ER+/HER2- treatment-naive primary BC from patients with clinically positive nodes and complete pathologic nodal data treated at Duke University (n=49, 30 cases pN1 vs. 19 cases >pN1). DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded samples, and DNA methylation profiling was performed using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip v1 arrays. The ChAMP package was utilized to correct batch effect, and the Wilcoxon test was used to identify Differentially Methylated Sites (DMS). Tumor content purity was assessed using the LUMP algorithm and Gene Ontology enrichment of the DMSs was examined with the GOmeth tool. Data analysis and visualization were performed using the R packages ggplot2 (v. 3.4.4), circlize (v. 0.4.16), and gplots (v. 3.1.3.1), with data management facilitated by the tidyverse (v. 2.0.0) collection. Results: Tumor purity was similar between the two groups (p>0.05). The comparison revealed distinct DNA methylation patterns in 962 genomic regions between pN1 and >pN1 tumors (differential methylation > 15%, p<0.01); 683 regions were hypermethylated and 279 were hypomethylated in the >pN1 group. There was a significant enrichment of biological processes associated with morphogenesis among the hypermethylated sites, with 22 of the 43 affected molecular pathways linked to cellular morphogenesis. Additionally, epigenetic alterations were predominantly found in pathways related to the response to bone morphogenic protein (BMP). Expression-methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (emQTLs) were linked to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes in >pN1 tumors. Finally, higher methylation of the protocadherin cluster genes (PCDHGA) and regions encompassing DUSP6 and KRT7 genes were identified in tumors of higher nodal stage. These findings suggest inherent or acquired epigenetic alterations in primary BC associated with higher nodal stage. Conclusions: Understanding the mechanisms underlying lymph node invasion in breast cancer progression is crucial for improving the clinical management of patients with BC. This study indicates that ER+/HER2- primary tumors from patients with higher nodal involvement have an epigenetic predisposition to activate morphogenic differentiation and EMT more efficiently than patients with lower nodal involvement. Deeper insight into these alterations could contribute to more accurate prognostic tools, the development of novel therapeutic approaches, and potentially help avoid more aggressive axillary procedures.

        <tr id="Background The heterogeneity of colorectal cancer (CRC) and its complex immune microenvironment pose significant challenges for treatment. Understanding the cellular composition and dynamic changes is essential for uncovering mechanisms of tumour progression. Methods To investigate the cellular heterogeneity and immune microenvironment of CRC, identifying critical subpopulations, functional pathways, and prognostic biomarkers, single-cell transcriptomic data from 41 CRC samples across four datasets were integrated. Bioinformatic analyses identified cellular subpopulations, cell communication networks, and prognostic biomarkers. The expression patterns, clinical significance and biological function of TUBB were validated in vitro. Results A distinct epithelial subpopulation with proliferative and invasive features was identified, promoting tumour progression by resisting apoptosis and remodelling the extracellular matrix. ActMono, a terminal state of myeloid cells, was enriched in tumours and linked to disease progression. Cell communication analysis highlighted galectin signalling in immune regulation. A prognostic model (CRS) based on secretory immune cell-related genes identified TUBB as a key molecule influencing the cell cycle and extracellular matrix remodelling, with its expression patterns, clinical significance and biological effects validated in vitro. Conclusion This study reveals critical subpopulations, signalling pathways, and biomarkers in CRC, providing insights into tumour progression and potential therapeutic strategies.">

 Background:
 Despite breakthroughs in genomically-matched therapies, many patients lack actionable genomic alterations. Consequently, innovative new strategies to identify targets for effective therapies are imperative. To assess the potential of comprehensive whole transcriptomic sequencing (WTS) in clinical decision-making, we conducted a prospective trial to perform WTS in patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors who had prior DNA-based panel testing (≥100 genes) with no reported AMP/ASCO/CAP Tier 1 actionable genomic alterations; along with whole exome sequencing (WES) to compare RNA expression to copy number alterations. We also developed an informed actionability classification scheme to determine actionability of transcriptomics findings.
 Methods:
 Between August 2022 and December 2024, 100 patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center with advanced cancers were enrolled and underwent comprehensive profiling. Alterations in RNA expression of 147 genes were considered as potentially actionable if the gene’s protein product is the direct target of a clinically available therapy (including cell surface targets of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)) and/or CNAs of the gene are predictive of response or resistance to a clinically available therapy. A clinical trial was considered a match if RNA expression was an enrollment criterion, or the gene alteration can be directly or indirectly targeted with a therapy utilized within the trial.
 Results:
 Actionable RNA expressions (AREs) were detected in all patients (100%). In total
 ,
 2,216 AREs were detected from 17,800 selected-reported RNA expressions; a median of 22 ARE changes were reported per patient [interquartile range (IQR), 17.0-26.0]. The majority (86.0%) of AREs were RNA overexpressions, defined as the distribution of
 tpm
 values of the gene expression > 83% of the pan-cancer reference cohort. A median of 13 RNA expression-matched trials were identified per patient [IQR, 10.0-16.0]. The most frequent drug class of actionable RNA overexpressions were ADCs, with a median of 10 ADC targets per patient. Out of 11 distinct genes of which at least 1 amplification is reported, a concordance rate of 61.5% and a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) value of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56-0.84) between the actionable gene amplifications (n = 13) and the actionable RNA overexpressions detected in the same patient sample from the tumor profile, indicates a substantial concordance by transcriptional profiling with copy number gain.
 Conclusions:
 WTS identified actionable RNA expressions in all patients– including for novel ADC targets. These results underscore the utility of comprehensive transcriptional profiling to identify additional actionable targets beyond DNA-based comprehensive profiling.

        <tr id="Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a central regulator of numerous cellular processes impacting DNA metabolism and genetic integrity, including DNA damage, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation. PCNA aberrations manifest in different disease phenotypes, including neoplastic proliferation, chromatin disassembly, genomic instability, and impaired DNA repair. Although the role of PCNA in control of DNA homeostasis has been extensively studied in some cancers, its pan-cancer relevance in tumorigenesis, immune interactions, and therapeutic resistance remains underexplored. Here, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of publicly available databases to assess the relationship between PCNA expression and the immunological, survival, genetic, functional, and drug sensitivity profiles across multiple cancer types. PCNA mRNA levels were altered in across cancers and associated with altered cancer signaling networks constituting Wnt, Hippo, and mTOR pathways. Increased transcript levels were associated with poor overall survival in some cancers, including ACC, CESC, LGG, and THYM. Amplification was the predominant genetic alteration of PCNA in multiple tumors. In several tumors, upregulation of PCNA was linked with differences in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and specific immune-inhibitors, and chemokines. Moreover, elevated PCNA expression was linked with increased sensitivity to several drugs, particularly to Navitoclax, NPK76-II-72-1, and Ciclopirox across cancers. Our study orients the first comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of PCNA, uncovering its prognostic significance and altered expression across various cancers through multiomics data. Unlike previous studies, tumor-specific genetic alterations, such as amplification and hypomethylation, and the paradoxical immune microenvironment linked to PCNA were explored, suggesting potential immune evasion mechanisms. Additionally, new therapeutic avenues reveal PCNA’s relationship with drug sensitivity to agents like Navitoclax and Ciclopirox, providing invaluable insights for pharmacological interventions.">

        <tr id="Aneuploidy is defined as the loss or gain of a whole chromosome or its region. Even at early stages of development, it usually leads to fatal consequences, including developmental defects/abnormalities and death. For a long time, it was believed that the disruption of gene balance results in pronounced effects at both the cellular and organismal levels, adversely affecting organism formation. It has been shown that the gene imbalance resulting from aneuploidy leads to proteotoxic and metabolic stress within the cell, reduced cell proliferation, genomic instability, oxidative stress, etc. However, some organisms have exhibited tolerance to aneuploidies, which may even confer adaptive advantages, such as antibiotic resistance in pathogenic fungal strains. A significant factor likely lies in the complexity of the tissue and organ organization of specific species. Polyploid organisms are generally more tolerant of aneuploidy, particularly those that have recently undergone whole-genome duplication. This review places special emphasis on the examination of sex chromosome aneuploidies in humans. In addition to primary effects, or cis effects (changes in the quantity of the transcripts of genes located on the aneuploid chromosome), aneuploidy can induce secondary or trans effects (changes in the expression levels of genes located on other chromosomes). The results of recent studies have prompted a reevaluation of the impact of aneuploidy on the structural-functional organization of the genome, transcriptome, and proteome of both the cell and the entire organism. Despite the fact that, in the cases of aneuploidy, the expression levels for most genes correlate with their altered copy numbers in the cell, there have been instances of dosage compensation, where the transcript levels of genes located on the aneuploid chromosome remained unchanged. The review presents findings from recent studies focused on compensatory mechanisms of dosage compensation that modify gene product quantities at post-transcriptional and post-translational levels, alleviating the negative effects of aneuploidy on cellular homeostasis. It also discusses the influence of extrachromosomal elements on the spatial organization of the genome and the changes in gene expression patterns resulting from their presence. Additionally, the review specifically examines cases of segmental aneuploidy and changes in copy number variants (CNVs) in the genome. Not only the implications of their composition are considered, but also their localization within the chromosome and in various compartments of the interphase nucleus. Addressing these questions could significantly contribute to enhancing cytogenomic diagnostics and establishing a necessary database for accurate interpretation of identified cases of segmental aneuploidy and CNVs in the genome.">

        <tr id="Guanine-rich DNA sequences have a propensity to form G-quadruplex structures. These structures play several important biological roles and are potential targets for anticancer drugs. However, no G-quadruplex-stabilizing agent has yet been approved for clinical use. Given that G-quadruplex stabilization is quite promising as a mechanism for novel anticancer therapies, it is crucial to elucidate its effects on healthy human cells. In our study, we modeled a potential human treatment using G4 -stabilizing agents and analyzed their effects on genome integrity, transcriptomic changes, and mitochondrial function focusing on non-cancerous cells to predict potential side effects of such treatments. We found that G-quadruplex stabilization does not compromise genome integrity. However, it can induce persistent alterations in the transcriptomic profile of human cells, including genes encoded on the mitochondrial genome. Notably, certain G-quadruplex-stabilizing agents triggered mitophagy in both human cells and Drosophila melanogaster. In summary, our findings indicate that while G-quadruplex stabilization does not cause genome instability, it may pose potential risks due to its long-term effects on transcription and its ability to induce mitophagy. Therefore, we recommend that all potential drug candidates be thoroughly evaluated for their ability to induce mitophagy and to promote cancer formation in animal models prior to clinical trials.

        <tr id="Cancer progression remains a significant clinical challenge. Phenotypic adaptation by tumour cells results in disease heterogeneity, which drives treatment resistance and immune escape. T-cell immunotherapy, while effective at treating some cancer subtypes, can also fail due to limits on tumour immunogenicity or T-cell recognition. For example, one potential contributor to immune escape involves the density and alignment of the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding tumours, also known as tumour-associated collagen signature (TACS). However, the specific mechanisms by which aligned fibres contribute to decreased patient survival rates have not yet been decoupled. Here, we developed EVO-ACT (EVOlutionary agent-based cancer T-cell interaction), a two-dimensional agent-based modelling framework designed to investigate how different TACS architectures impact tumour evolution and dynamic interactions with CD8[Formula: see text] T cells. Our results highlight that TACS-driven modulation of T-cell dynamics, combined with phenotypic adaptation, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, underlies differences in tumour immunogenicity and the application of our model can successfully recapitulate clinically observed breast cancer survival trends.">

 Background:
 Endometrial cancer (EC) illustrates diverse nucleotide substitution and chromosomal re-arrangement signatures like other cancers. Namely, four molecular types are identified, replicative polymerases, microsatellite stable, copy number high/serous-like, and microsatellite instability characterized by mutations in mismatch repair genes. With advances in molecular techniques, early prediction of disease aggressiveness can be revealed using comprehension in ECs. Although few cell proliferative genes have been documented, a complete molecular landscaping is essential for effective treatment planning and decision-making. We report, the association between clinical disease status and corresponding molecular findings to establish the role of the latter in the early prediction of disease aggression in endometrial cancer.
 Methods:
 Retrospectively, we investigated the association of genomic mutational profiles of 40 endometrial cancer patients and their clinical disease status from PET scans and HPE reports. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) test was performed using a comprehensive genomic panel (CGP) OncoIndx assay.
 Results:
 Amongst 40 patients, 65% (n = 26/40) of patients had progressive and metastatic disease from PET scans and HPE reports indicative of disease aggressiveness. Almost 80% (n = 20/26) of the aggressive disease cohort were detected to have a minimum of one genomic alteration. Their mutational profiles showed a diverse spectrum of pathway-related aberrations from cell proliferation, progression, double-strand DNA (dsDNA) repair, mismatch repair (MMR), and tumor suppression constituting a total of 83 genomic alterations detected in the whole cohort. Further, the cell proliferation and dsDNA repair pathways exhibited the highest mutational load of 57.8% (n = 48/83) and 14.5% (n = 12/83) respectively in the cohort. Likewise, tumor suppressor genes constituted the lowest frequency at 6% (n = 5/83).In addition, five patients were detected with high MSI scores and one patient with an intermediate MSI score of which two MSI-high patients were also found to harbor MMR gene mutations (MSH3:p.K383Rfs*32, p.D403H, p.E456* and p.E512*, MSH6:p.F1088Sfs*2).
 Conclusions:
 Using CGP, we observed mutational frequencies of cell proliferation and dsDNA repair pathways that act as crucial markers for disease aggression in EC. We also noted that high MSI scores were not always concordant with mutations in the classical MMR genes and vice versa. This also indicates the individual significance of estimating MSI scores in these patients for clinical decision-making. Since the identified landscape of mutations well correlated with the disease states categorized from their clinical findings, they could potentially transform into molecular attributes for early prediction of progression and metastasis aiding treatment planning and decision making.

        <tr id="Although the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases with age, most adults maintain normoglycemia despite rising insulin resistance, largely due to the adaptive capacity of pancreatic beta cells to meet increased metabolic demand. However, persistent insulin resistance can lead to beta cell dysfunction and T2D onset. Here, leveraging cell-type-specific methylome data from the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP), we investigate the epigenomic basis of beta cell adaptation by mapping genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns across the human lifespan. In healthy donors, we identify progressive age-related demethylation enriched in cis- regulatory elements at beta cell identity and function genes, suggesting that epigenetic remodeling supports functional adaptation to metabolic demand over time. In contrast, alpha cells show the opposite trajectory, with subtle, age-related hypermethylation. In T2D beta but not alpha cells we observed further demethylation compared to healthy controls, underscoring a unique capacity of beta cells to respond to changes in metabolic demand. Together, our findings suggest that DNAm remodeling in healthy beta cells reflects a long-term adaptation to metabolic demand, which in T2D is accelerated as part of a compensatory response that ultimately fails under sustained insulin resistance.">

        <tr id="Background The human genome contains approximately 3,200 near full-length autonomous human endogenous retroviral (HERV) genomes distributed across the 23 chromosomes. These autonomous HERV proviral genomes include long terminal repeats (LTRs) capable of promoting RNA transcription. In quiescent cells, most HERV loci remain transcriptionally silent. However, environmental changes, such as epigenetic remodeling of chromatin, can activate these silenced loci. Methods To study HERV reactivation, we previously analyzed autonomous HERV expression patterns in monocytes isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) identified in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) databases using the Azimuth application. We developed a Window-based HERV Alignment (WHA) method, which analyzes aligned DNA sequences using sequential, non-overlapping windows of defined lengths. Samples were scored as positive (>= 9 good/usable windows) or negative (<= 8 good/usable windows). Results Using WHA, we established a control set from 31 normal individuals, with fewer than 8 windows at selected HERV loci. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from three studies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and found distinct HERV expression patterns in monocytes. Unique patterns were also found in patients with influenza, Dengue virus, or sepsis. We next examined HERV expression at early (<7 days) and late (>14 days) timepoints post COVID-19 recovery and detected HERV loci in both groups. Analyzing 12 patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), we identified three HERV loci expressed in all patients. Some loci showed amplified numbers of good/usable windows, indicating longer transcripts and greater sequence depth. The most amplified locus was located within an intron of JAKMIP2, which, along with neighboring host genes, also showed increased transcription. Conclusion Previous studies have shown that viral infections, including COVID-19, influenza, and Dengue virus, as well as sepsis, can induce innate immune memory in monocytes through epigenetic remodeling of hematopoietic stem and myeloid precursor cells. The identification of co-amplified HERV loci and neighboring host gene transcripts in monocytes from PASC patients suggests expansion of epigenetically remodeled myeloid progenitors. The identification of these HERV-host gene patterns provides a foundation needed to understand the clinical features of patients with PASC.">

Single-cell biophysical properties distinguish functional phenotypes complementary to these approaches, providing additional insight into cellular diversity. Here we link both buoyant mass and stiffness to gene expression to identify clinically relevant phenotypes within primary mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells, employing MCL as a model of biological and clinical diversity in human cancer. Linked measurements reveal that buoyant mass and stiffness characterize B-cell development states from naïve to plasma cell and correlate with expression of oncogenic B-cell receptor signaling genes such as BLK and CD79A. Additionally, changes in cell buoyant mass within primary patient specimens ex vivo correlate with sensitivity to Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors in vivo in MCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, another B-cell malignancy. These findings highlight the value of biophysical properties as biomarkers of response in pursuit of future precision therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Somatic cell reprogramming into human induced pluripotent stem cells entails significant intracellular changes, including modifications in mitochondrial metabolism and a decrease in mitochondrial DNA copy number. However, the mechanisms underlying this decrease in mitochondrial DNA copy number during reprogramming remain unclear. Here we aimed to elucidate these underlying mechanisms. Through a meta-analysis of several RNA sequencing datasets, we identified genes responsible for the decrease in mitochondrial DNA. We investigated the functions of these identified genes and assessed their regulatory mechanisms. In particular, the expression of the thymidine kinase 2 gene (TK2), located in the mitochondria and required for mitochondrial DNA synthesis, is decreased in human pluripotent stem cells as compared with its expression in somatic cells. TK2 was significantly downregulated during reprogramming and markedly upregulated during differentiation. Collectively, this decrease in TK2 levels induces a decrease in mitochondrial DNA copy number and contributes to shaping the metabolic characteristics of human pluripotent stem cells. However, contrary to our expectations, treatment with a TK2 inhibitor impaired somatic cell reprogramming. These results suggest that decreased TK2 expression may result from metabolic conversion during somatic cell reprogramming.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: TIGD1 (Trigger Transposable Element Derived 1) is a recently identified oncogene with largely unexplored biological functions. Emerging evidence suggests its involvement in multiple cellular processes across cancer types. This study aimed to perform a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of TIGD1 to evaluate its expression patterns, diagnostic utility, prognostic value, and association with immunotherapy response and drug resistance. Methods: Transcriptomic and clinical data from TCGA and GTEx were analyzed using various bioinformatic tools. Expression profiling, survival analysis, immune correlation studies, gene set enrichment, single-cell sequencing, and drug sensitivity assessments were performed. Results: TIGD1 was found to be significantly upregulated in various tumor types, with notably high expression in colon adenocarcinoma. Elevated TIGD1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in several cancers. TIGD1 levels correlated with key features of the tumor immune microenvironment, including immune checkpoint gene expression, TMB, and MSI, suggesting a role in modulating anti-tumor immunity. GSEA and single-cell analyses implicated TIGD1 in oncogenic signaling pathways. Furthermore, high TIGD1 expression was linked to resistance to several therapeutic agents, including Zoledronate, Dasatinib, and BLU-667. Conclusions: TIGD1 may serve as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, particularly in colon, gastric, liver, and lung cancers. Its strong associations with immune modulation and therapy resistance highlight its potential as a novel target for precision oncology and immunotherapeutic intervention.">

 Background:
 Biliary tract cancers (BTC) are rare, highly aggressive malignancies with limited treatment options, leading to consistently poor outcomes. An improved understanding of BTC tumor evolution could inform enhanced screening strategies, identify useful prognostic markers, and discover novel therapeutic targets.
 Methods:
 We performed whole genome and transcriptome sequencing (WGTS) at high depth ( > 80X) on a prospective cohort of BTC tumors. After detecting mutations and mutational signatures, we developed two novel methods for driver identification and evolutionary reconstruction. First, we created new oncogene and tumor suppressor-specific models that integrate copy number profiles, structural variant breakends, and expression changes to distinguish structural drivers from neutral chromosomal rearrangements. Second, we applied population genetics techniques to fit demographic models to tumor allele frequencies across 20 paired primary and metastatic samples.
 Results:
 We analyzed 130 tumor samples from 110 patients, representing the largest BTC whole-genome cohort to date. We identified hypermutated tumors (50-150 mutations/mb) with distinct etiologies, including mismatch repair deficiency, platinum exposure, tobacco use, and aristolochic acid-related damage, the latter of which was associated with response to immunotherapy. Ourintegrated-driver approach identified an association between selection on
 RAD23A
 and an increased structural variant load, resulting in a tandem-duplicator-like mutational phenotype. This also revealed an underappreciated impact of
 SMAD4
 in BTC, which is inactivated through multiple mutation types in 12%. Notably,
 BAP1
 mutations occurred in 24% of cases, including 4% that were inactivated through deletion of the
 BAP1
 promoter that lowered transcript expression, a previously undescribed mechanism. By pairing clinical data to the genomics, we observed a co-occurrence of
 BAP1
 mutations and
 FGFR2
 fusions in small-duct, mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. These mutations were mutually exclusive with
 TP53
 mutations, which were enriched in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Finally, our novel method for subclonal population reconstruction on paired samples illuminated recent tumor evolutionary dynamics and identified an
 ARID1B
 fusion with a potential role in metastasis.
 Conclusions:
 This study uncovered novel genomic mechanisms underlying the evolutionary origins of BTC beyond those previously identified with exome and panel sequencing, highlighting the value of WGTS. These results highlight the complex genomic heterogeneity of BTC, with potential implications for precision therapy.

Here, we revealed that glutathione metabolic pathway controlled by glutathione peroxidase GPX2 was abnormally activated in gefitinib-resistant A549 and HCC827-GR cell lines. Mechanistically, GPX2 triggers Hedgehog signaling activation through releasing GLI transcriptional regulator, promoting cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics and TKI resistance.

        <tr id="The circadian clock governs daily rhythms in numerous physiological processes through precise regulation of gene expression and biochemical functions. Dysregulation of the circadian rhythm has been implicated in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. However, the mechanisms by which the circadian clock influences cancer phenotype and chemotherapy resistance, particularly in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), remain poorly understood. Using cell lines established from primary CCA and metastatic ascites of two male patients, we manipulated core clock genes (BMAL1, PER2, and NR1D1) to evaluate their effects on circadian rhythms. We analyzed alterations in circadian phenotypes at dynamic and single time points and assessed their impact on cancer-related phenotypic changes, including proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, migration, invasion, and the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell markers. Additionally, we examined the impact of circadian disruption on gemcitabine sensitivity. Genetic deletion of BMAL1, PER2, and NR1D1 disrupted circadian rhythm and significantly altered cancer phenotypes. Notably, BMAL1 and NR1D1 impairment exacerbated cell migration, invasion, and EMT activation in CCA cells. BMAL1 loss also induced gemcitabine resistance. In contrast, PER2 repression enhanced chemosensitivity and inhibited metastasis. The modulation of the circadian gene triggered phenotypic changes in CCA cells, indicating a crucial involvement of core-clock components in the pathological mechanisms hastening bile duct cancer malignancy. Our findings advance the understanding of regulating CCA malignancy and may offer a novel target for its treatment.">

There are limited therapeutic options as these tumors do not respond to hormonal therapy or HER2-targeted treatments. We hypothesized that new insights into pathogenic mechanisms in TNBC can be obtained from studying epigenetic alterations through Hi-C (genome-wide chromosome conformation capture) data analysis.We developed a computational strategy that captured key properties of chromatin conformation while incorporating statistical measures of interaction significance. This model addresses limitations in Hi-C data analysis without relying on predefined features like TADs and compartments. We applied this model to Hi-C and RNA-seq data from TNBC patients, representing the data as multilayer networks to identify genome-wide properties of the TNBC 3D genome.Our network-based analysis revealed distinct chromatin interaction patterns in TNBC compared to healthy contralateral controls. Hi-C data can distinguish interaction patterns related to diseased phenotypes or interaction patterns with potential to exert regulatory effects instead of incidental contacts, but some apparently random interactions may also support important genome regulatory activities.Our findings demonstrate that network-based Hi-C analysis can capture the genome-wide complexity of chromatin interactions in TNBC. This integrative approach provides new insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying TNBC pathogenesis and contributes to the advancement of analysis methods for future investigations into novel therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Essential transcription and cell cycle progression controllers are CDKs, whose dysregulation is a defining trait of many human cancers. CDKs have grown to be very crucial therapeutic targets in cancer. Although traditional CDK inhibitors have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy, they frequently encounter limitations due to resistance mechanisms and off-target effects. Recent developments in targeted protein degradation, like proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glues, offer creative ways to destroy CDK proteins specifically. These techniques reduce scaffolding activities and slow down kinase activity, hence more completely blocking oncogenic CDK signaling. This paper highlights the clinical and preclinical developments of PROTACs and molecular glues, investigates the current CDK-targeting therapeutic landscape, and studies the molecular basis of CDK dysregulation in cancer. We also address their benefits over conventional inhibitors, current issues, and possibilities for inclusion into precision oncology. These new approaches taken together represent a change in CDK-targeted cancer therapy.">

 Background:
 HNCs are a diverse group of malignancies characterized by genetic, epigenetic, and proteomic alterations that drive tumor progression, treatment resistance, and poor outcomes.
 Methods:
 Molecular profiling of 273 HNC samples was conducted using a semiconductor-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform at Datar Cancer Genetics. A subset of 106 cases underwent targeted transcriptomic analysis of 20,802 genes. Additionally, PD-L1 (22C3) IHC, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB) were analyzed in selected samples.
 Results:
 Transcriptomic analysis highlighted significant alterations in critical cellular pathways, including cell cycle control, apoptosis, DNA repair mechanisms, and transcription regulation. Among the most dysregulated genes were
 DLGAP5
 ,
 CASP14
 ,
 BCL2
 , and
 JUN
 . Copy number profiling in a subset (N=74) revealed significant chromosomal instability, with 34% of cases showing losses on specific chromosome arms and 9% exhibiting gains, notably in regions such as
 4p, 19p
 and
 1p.
 Mutations were predominantly observed in tumor suppressor genes, with a lower frequency in oncogenes. Frequently altered genes include
 TP53
 (63%),
 CDKN2A
 (19%),
 PIK3CA
 (12%),
 TERT
 (15%),
 HRAS
 (6%) and
 EGFR
 (1%).
 HRAS
 mutations offer potential for targeted therapy with tipifarnib, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor.
 EGFR
 alterations, though rare, have proven challenging to effectively target with
 EGFR
 -specific therapies such as cetuximab or tyrosine kinase inhibitors, underscoring the critical need for innovative strategies to exploit this target. Amplifications were observed in
 MYC
 (9%),
 CCND1
 (8%),
 FGF19
 (6%),
 FGF3
 (4%) and
 FGF4
 (4%). Targetable amplifications were seen in
 EGFR
 (6%),
 ERBB2
 (2%) and
 MET
 (1%), offering potential opportunities for personalized therapies.
 MET
 amplifications are also linked to aggressive tumor behavior. Fusion was a relatively less common event, observed in 9.5% cases, including one case each of targetable
 BRAF-MRPS33
 and
 FGFR1-PLAG1
 fusion. High TMB (≥10 muts/mb) was seen in 21% cases (Median 12, range 0-28). None of the tumors showed MSI-high status (n=63). Higher PD-L1 positivity was observed in TMB high samples (76% vs 59%), with PD-L1 22-C3 CPS ≥1 in 66% (50/ 76) and PD-L1 28-8 TPS ≥1 in 46% (36/ 78).
 Conclusions:
 This study underscores the genetic heterogeneity of HNCs, pointing to deregulated pathways involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and DNA repair as promising targets for future therapeutic development and personalized treatment strategies. Also this study points towards a subset of patients who may derive a greater benefit with immunotherapy, based on TMB/PDL1.

        <tr id="Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains the leading cause of mortality among prostate cancer patients. While second-generation androgen receptor (AR) pathway-targeted therapies, such as Abiraterone, have significantly improved survival outcomes, resistance to these treatments ultimately emerges, posing a critical challenge. Understanding the mechanisms underlying Abiraterone resistance is essential for developing strategies to enhance patient outcomes. In this study, a super-enhancer (SE)-driven transcriptional regulatory circuit is identified involving BCL6, NFIB, and SMAD3 that facilitates Abiraterone resistance in CRPC. Through comprehensive analyses of SE expression profiles in Abiraterone-resistant CRPC cells and their parental counterparts, it is revealed that this circuit plays a pivotal role in resistance progression. Mechanistically, BCL6, NFIB, and SMAD3 synergistically remodel the transcriptional landscape of resistant CRPC cells, driving resistance by regulating cholesterol biosynthesis and cell cycle pathways. The findings provide critical insights into the transcriptional dysregulation underlying Abiraterone resistance and highlight potential therapeutic strategies to counteract treatment resistance in CRPC, ultimately aiming to improve patient survival and quality of life.">

        <tr id="Introduction Traditional treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), such as chemotherapy, especially platinum-based regimens, often lack efficacy due to the disease’s inherent heterogeneity. Precision medicine in NSCLC recognizes each tumor’s unique genetic profile. Alterations in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of platinum-based therapies significantly influence their clinical outcomes. Previous research has predominantly focused on genetic polymorphisms in genes like Glutathione S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1), ATP Binding Cassette subfamily C member 2 (ABCC2), Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 and 2 (ERCC1, and/ ERCC2), which play crucial roles in detoxification, drug transportation, and Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER). However, findings have shown considerable variability. Methods The analysis followed the PRISMA and STROPS Guidelines, using specific search terms including NSCLC, Chemotherapy, Polymorphisms, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), ERCC1, ERCC2, ABCC2, GSTP1, Effectiveness, and Clinical Response. These studies were subjected to full-text screening process. Results Initial screening of 370 studies, comprising 275 from PubMed and 95 from EBSCO, identified 53 relevant ones, excluding those such as reviews, non-English studies, and meta-analyses. Among the genetic variants studied (ERCC1 rs11615, ERCC2 rs13181, ABCC2 rs717620, GSTP1 rs1695), GSTP1 rs1695 emerged as particularly promising, with 11 studies indicating a significant association with improved survival outcomes. Conclusion The integration of SNP profiling into clinical decision-making processes holds substantial potential for enhancing the personalization of NSCLC treatment strategies, thereby improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains one of the most aggressive and therapeutically challenging subtypes of BC due to its lack of targeted treatment options and high plasticity. Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation, play a pivotal role in facilitating TNBC phenotype by influencing the expression of genes involved in subtype reprogramming. Modulating these epigenetic marks offers a promising strategy to drive TNBC subtype conversion toward less aggressive forms that are more responsive to treatment, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy. By targeting enzymes such as DNA methyltransferases and histone modifiers using epigenetic drugs (epidrugs), TNBC cells can be re-sensitized to hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted treatments. This review delves into the role of epigenetic modulation in harnessing the plasticity of TNBC to drive its conversion into subtypes with better prognoses and discusses problems and limitations associated with the use of epidrugs in this context. By promoting subtype conversion, epidrugs offer a promising strategy for providing more personalized and effective therapies for TNBC patients.">

 Background:
 The development of resistance is the one of the reason for ineffective treatment of soft tissue sarcomas (STSs). The search for new molecular-biological targets, both for the personalized selection of novel targeted drugs and for predicting chemoresistance of STSs to individual antitumor agents and their combinations, is a pressing task.
 Methods:
 In this study, an experimental in vitro chemoresistance analysis, whole-genome sequencing, and single-cell sequencing of tumors in patients (N = 9) with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas were performed. Chemotherapy resistance indices were determined for the obtained samples.
 Results:
 Whole-genome DNA sequencing yielded data on the type and frequency of somatic mutations in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, and driver genes of carcinogenesis were identified, among which the most frequently occurring were FCGBP, PARP4, TP53, RGPD3, PDE4DIP, and RB1. Correlations between the presence of genetic alterations and the response to chemotherapy in the in vitro test were sought. Thus, in samples resistant to the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide, the presence of mutations in the PEG3, USP8, NT5C3A, and WAS genes was characteristic. Bioinformatic analysis of single-cell transcriptome sequencing data, aimed at characterizing the population composition and transcriptomic landscape of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma cells, revealed 15 normal and 8 tumor cell populations. Among the populations of normal cells, the following clusters were identified: M2 and M1 macrophages, T-cells, matrix-remodeling fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, monocytes, stromal cells, endothelial cells, and osteoblasts. Among tumor cells, clusters of proliferating cells, hypoxic cells, matrix-interacting cells, and tumor cells with a stem-like phenotype were identified. The most common clusters in all samples were M2 macrophages, endothelial cells, and one of the clusters of tumor cells interacting with the matrix. Comparison of the expression profiles of cells from patients with different responses to chemotherapy allowed identification and characterization of clusters associated with chemosensitivity and chemoresistance. These included clusters of macrophages, tumor cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. In addition, genes common to all clusters associated with resistant samples were identified (ARGLU1, JUND, TNNT3, RHOB, CCNL2, LENG8, LUC7L3, KLF9, RSRP1, RNF213, SERPINE1, CDK5RAP3).
 Conclusions:
 The data obtained in this study will expand the understanding of the pathogenesis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas and the mechanisms underlying their development of chemotherapy resistance. In the future, this will serve as the basis for creating a test system to evaluate the expression levels of genes whose activation/repression is associated with the development of drug resistance in STSs.

 Sex differences in breast cancer (BC) lead to distinct clinical and molecular characteristics. Sex-associated heterogeneity relies intricately on the oncogenic properties of cancer cells and multicellular interactions in tumor microenvironments. Here we conducted a multiomic analysis encompassing single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and large-scale histological analysis, combined with genetic and pharmacological perturbations to systematically develop a high-resolution and spatially resolved map of intratumoral expression heterogeneity in male breast cancer (MBC). Among the malignant cells, we identify 9 consensus meta-programs (MPs, for example, estrogen response and interferon response), each consisting of dozens of genes that are coordinately upregulated in subpopulations of cells within MBC. Of these, MP5 exhibits significant male bias, characterized by aberrant activation of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling pathway, inducing endocrine therapy resistance in MBC. Bidirectional interactions between MP5 malignant cells and immunosuppressive cancer-associated fibroblasts form an immune exclusionary microenvironment mediated by LRBA. Collectively, our study highlights the endocrine therapy resistant and immunosuppressive role of LRBA in MBC, and these findings may provide insights into the molecular features of MBC and facilitate the development of sex-specifical treatment strategies.

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal malignancy of myeloid progenitor cells that demonstrates highly variable responses to current regimens, highlighting the need for precision medicine. However, reliable biomarkers for precision medicine treatment remain elusive due to cellular heterogeneity. Conventional Models based on bulk RNA sequencing and ex vivo assays often fail to capture the intricate molecular pathways and gene networks that underlie treatment response and resistance. Here, NetAML, a novel network-based precision medicine platform that systematically develops 87 drug sensitivity prediction models for 87 clinical drugs using ex vivo drug responses from 520 AML patients with RNA-Seq is presented. The approach leverages network-based analysis and machine learning to identify biologically interpretable gene signatures that capture the complex molecular interactions driving differential drug responses. Notably, the signature genes derived from the models reveal distinct cellular mechanisms. For instance, the co-expression of C19ORF59 and FLT3 is associated with resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. In summary, NetAML offers a powerful strategy for personalized AML treatment by constructing drug-specific models, identifying clinically actionable biomarkers, and supporting the development of optimized, patient-specific therapeutic regimens.">

Patients with leukemic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (L-CTCL) have a poor prognosis due to development of drug-resistance and severe bacterial infections. Here, we show that most L-CTCL patients harbor multiple genetically distinct subclones that express an identical clonal antigen receptor but display distinct phenotypes and functional properties. These co-existing malignant subclones exhibit differences in tissue homing, metabolism, and cytokine expression, and respond differently to extrinsic factors like Staphylococcus (S.)aureus and cancer drugs. Indeed, while S. aureus toxins selectively enhance activation and proliferation of certain subclones, these responsive subclones are also the most intrinsically sensitive to cancer drugs when the stimuli are removed. Consequently, although divergent evolution of malignant subclones drives aggressiveness, adaptability and drug-resistance, by removing extrinsic stimuli and mapping malignant subclones, we can expose inherent vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the treatment of these cancers.">

 Background:
 Children with high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma (NB) need improved therapies, and recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, such as
 MYCN
 oncogene amplification, represent candidate therapeutic targets.
 MYCN
 amplification and increased
 MYCN
 expression drive deregulated hyper-transcription that leads to development and growth of NB tumors, and
 MYCN
 amplifications, which can be found both within the linear genome (HSR) and on circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), are associated with significantly worse survival rates for children with NB.
 MYCN
 overexpression has been linked to an increase in replication stress (RS), and RS and subsequent genome instability are important drivers of tumor initiation and progression. Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a non-essential DNA replication enzyme, was identified as a synthetic lethal target in
 BRCA1
 /
 2
 -deficient cancers via induction of RS. Recent success of targeting RS-elevated cancers with replication enzyme inhibitors opens a new avenue to target
 MYCN
 -amplified NB.
 Methods:
 Associations of gene expression with patient survival and prognostic features were performed on available neuroblastoma tumor databases using the R2 Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform. The efficacy of FEN1 inhibition was assessed using live cell imaging and cell viability assays, comparing results in
 MYCN
 -amplified to -nonamplified NB cells and in NB cells with inducible
 MYCN
 expression and repression. Mechanisms of cell death and impacts on replication stress in cells treated with FEN1 inhibitors were evaluated by Western blots.
 Results:
 We have found that
 FEN1
 expression levels are associated wtih NB patient outcomes and with features of high-risk disease, including tumor stage and
 MYCN
 amplification. FEN1 inhibition was effective against NB cells and was significantly more effective in
 MYCN
 -amplified NB cells causing reduced cell growth and viability. Increased
 MYCN
 expression also led to increased sensitivity to FEN1 inhibition, and reduced MYCN expression reduced sensitivity. FEN1 inhibition led to the induction of apoptosis but not necroptosis in NB cells and responses to FEN1 inhibition were associated with markers of replication stress, including activation of the ATR-CHK1 and ATM-CHK2 pathways.
 Conclusions:
 We have discovered that
 MYCN
 -amplified NB cells are hypersensitive to FEN1 inhibition, suggesting that FEN1 inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for children with high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma.

        <tr id="Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common inherited disorder predisposing individuals to colorectal cancer (CRC). It results from germline defects in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, which are critical for maintaining genomic integrity. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of the MMR genes MLH1 and PMS2 are significantly reduced in colon tumor tissues from a proband with CRC, potentially resulting from inherited mutations in the MLH1 gene in LS cases. We identified a previously unreported in-frame deletion mutation in the MLH1 gene, classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) due to its undefined role in oncogenesis. The majority of functionally inactive mutants were located in the residues Phe614 to Lys617, which form crucial hydrogen bonds. Taken together, our data reveals a correlation between this mutation and increased susceptibility to LS-associated tumors. The study offers a valuable insight for evaluating cancer susceptibility in carriers of MLH1 mutants, potentially elucidating the functional roles of MLH1 in oncogenesis.

        <tr id="Aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC), contributing to tumor progression through the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes. Indicaxanthin (IND), a dietary betalain pigment from Opuntia ficus indica, has shown antiproliferative effects in CRC models, yet its epigenetic impact remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the effects of IND on the methylome of Caco-2 cells using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS). IND induced a global hypermethylation profile, particularly at gene promoters and CpG islands. Among the differentially methylated genes, 60% were protein-coding, and 10% encoded transcription factors, including PAX5 and TFAP4, both hypermethylated at active enhancers. Functional enrichment analysis revealed pathways beyond canonical intestinal functions, suggesting altered cell identity and plasticity. Transcription factor targets (SOX10, NFKB1, AHR, ARNT) were significantly enriched among the affected genes, several of which are involved in transdifferentiation processes. Methylation changes also indicated potential reprogramming toward epithelial cell types from pulmonary or neuroectodermal origin. Moreover, IND induced selective hypomethylation of Alu elements on chromosome 21 and hypermethylation of rDNA loci, hinting at suppressed ribosomal biogenesis. Overall, these findings highlight the epigenetic remodeling potential of IND and its possible role in modulating cell fate and metabolism in CRC cells.">

        <tr id="Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a hallmark of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency and characterizes a distinct subset of colorectal cancers (CRC). In parallel, telomere length dynamics have emerged as important contributors to genomic stability and tumorigenesis. However, the relationship between MSI status, MMR protein expression, and telomere maintenance remains poorly defined. This study aimed to investigate the association between MSI status and telomere length in CRC cell lines and to evaluate the expression of key MMR proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) to elucidate molecular differences between MSI and microsatellite stable (MSS) phenotypes. A panel of CRC cell lines with known MSI and MSS statuses was used. Telomere length was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) based on the T/S ratio method. MSI status was confirmed via PCR using mononucleotide repeat markers. Western blotting was performed to assess protein expressions of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. β-actin served as a loading control. qPCR analysis revealed that MSI cell lines exhibited significantly longer telomeres compared to MSS lines (P < 0.05). Western blot results showed reduced or absent expression of MLH1 and PMS2 in MSI cell lines, confirming MMR deficiency. In contrast, MSS cell lines maintained normal expression of all tested MMR proteins. These findings suggest a link between defective MMR function and altered telomere dynamics in MSI-CRC. MSI CRC cell lines exhibit telomere elongation and loss of key MMR proteins, highlighting distinct molecular features compared to MSS counterparts. These insights may inform future strategies for personalized CRC diagnostics and therapeutics, particularly in the context of telomere-targeted or immunomodulatory treatments.

 Background:
 MTAP
 loss leads to methylthioadenosine (MTA) accumulation, disrupting downstream metabolic pathways. Targeting synthetic lethal interactions with
 MTAP
 loss offers a promising therapeutic strategy. The DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, essential for genomic stability, is commonly dysregulated in lung cancer, impacting treatment response and prognosis. Emerging evidence has highlighted potential association between
 MTAP
 loss and mutations in DDR genes, suggesting that investigating their relationship is critical for uncovering disease mechanisms and identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
 Methods:
 Hybridization capture sequencing with StarPanel NGS Assay (1,326 genes) was conducted on 2,258 Chinese lung cancer patients' tumor and matched peripheral blood samples. Then somatic and germline mutations, and TMB values of each sample were obtained. Based on a depth-based algorithm, differences between tissue and control samples in CNVs from the gene level were analyzed. Besides, we utilized shifts in germline heterozygous SNPs within the gene region to assist in determining if the loss was homozygous or heterozygous.
 Results:
 Homozygous and heterozygous deletions of
 MTAP
 were detected in 11.07% and 6.95% of all samples. Notably, 61.67% of these samples exhibited co-loss of
 MTAP
 ,
 CDKN2A
 and
 CDKN2B
 . The median TMB was significantly higher in samples with
 MTAP
 loss (3.85 mut/Mb) compared to those with intact
 MTAP
 (2.56 mut/Mb). In samples with homozygous
 MTAP
 loss, the top somatically co-altered genes were
 EGFR
 (76.00%),
 TP53
 (57.60%) and
 CDKN2A
 (52.80%). Gain-of-function (GoF) mutations were most prevalent in
 EGFR
 (56.80%),
 KRAS
 (12.00%) and
 MDM2
 (10.00%), while Loss-of-function (LoF) mutations were most common in
 TP53
 (50.40%),
 RBM10
 (11.60%) and
 PTEN
 (7.60%). Notably, LoF mutations in
 MTAP
 -loss samples showed a higher prevalence of DDR genes compared to
 MTAP
 -intact samples, including
 RAD50
 (2.40% vs. 0.00%,
 p
 < .0001) and
 POLQ
 (2.40% vs. 0.00%,
 p
 < .0001). Enrichment analysis further revealed LoF mutations unique to
 MTAP
 -loss samples were significantly enriched in the DDR pathway (
 p
 < .0001). For top germline pathogenic mutations, two DDR genes,
 RECQL4
 (0.80% vs. 0.38%,
 p
 = 0.29) and
 BRCA2
 (0.40% vs. 0.43%,
 p
 = 1), showed no significant differences between
 MTAP
 -loss and
 MTAP
 -intact samples.
 Conclusions:
 Potential association exists between
 MTAP
 loss and DDR pathway dysregulation, which may impact tumorigenic processes and therapeutic vulnerabilities. The enrichment of DDR-related LoF mutations indicates
 MTAP
 loss could exacerbate genomic instability by impairing DNA damage repair mechanisms, thereby increasing TMB and driving cancer progression with a distinct molecular profile. These vulnerabilities are primarily driven by somatic mutations, providing a rationale for exploring personalized treatment strategies.

        <tr id="Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a diverse collection of malignant tumors that originate in the bile ducts. Mitochondria, the energy converters in eukaryotic cells, contain circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) which has a greater mutation rate than nuclear DNA. Heteroplasmic variations in mtDNA may suggest an increased risk of cancer-related mortality, serving as a potential prognostic marker. In this study, we investigated the mtDNA variations of five CCA cell lines, including KKU-023, KKU-055, KKU-100, KKU213A, and KKU-452 and compared them to the non-tumor cholangiocyte MMNK-1 cell line. We used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), a long-read sequencing technology capable of synthesizing the whole mitochondrial genome, which facilitates enhanced identification of complicated rearrangements in mitogenomics. The analysis revealed a high frequency of SNVs and INDELs, particularly in the D-loop, MT-RNR2, MT-CO1, MT-ND4, and MT-ND5 genes. Significant mutations were detected in all CCA cell lines, with particularly notable non-synonymous SNVs such as m.8462T > C in KKU-023, m.9493G > A in KKU-055, m.9172C > A in KKU-100, m.15024G > C in KKU-213A, m.12994G > A in KKU-452, and m.13406G > A in MMNK-1, which demonstrated high pathogenicity scores. The presence of these mutations suggests the potential for mitochondrial dysfunction and CCA progression. Analysis of mtDNA structural variants (SV) revealed significant variability among the cell lines. We identified 208 SVs in KKU-023, 185 SVs in KKU-055, 231 SVs in KKU-100, 69 SVs in KKU-213A, 172 SVs in KKU-452, and 217 SVs in MMNK-1. These SVs included deletions, duplications, and inversions, with the highest variability observed in KKU-100 and the lowest in KKU-213A. Our results underscore the diverse mtDNA mutation landscape in CCA cell lines, highlighting the potential impact of these mutations on mitochondrial function and CCA cell line progression. Future research is required to investigate the functional impacts of these variants, their interactions with nuclear DNA in CCA, and their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Mutations in the p53 gene are frequently observed in various cancers, prompting the initiation of efforts to restore p53 function as a therapeutic approach several decades ago. Nevertheless, only a limited number of drug development initiatives have progressed to late-stage clinical trials, and to date, no p53-targeted therapies have received approval in the USA or Europe. This situation can be attributed primarily to the characteristics of p53 as a nuclear transcription factor, which lacks the conventional features associated with drug targets and has historically been considered “undruggable”. In recent years, however, several promising strategies have emerged, including the enhanced iterations of previous approaches and novel techniques aimed at targeting proteins that have traditionally been considered undruggable. There is a growing interest in small molecules that can restore the tumor-suppressive functions of mutant p53 proteins, and the development of drugs specifically designed for particular p53 mutation types is currently underway. Other approaches aim to deplete mutant p53 or exploit vulnerabilities associated with its expression. Additionally, genetic therapy strategy and approaches have rekindled interest. Advances in mutant p53 biology, compound mechanisms, treatment modalities, and nanotechnology have opened up new avenues for p53-based therapies. However, significant challenges remain in clinical development. This review reassesses the progress in targeting p53-mutant cancers, discusses the obstacles in translating these approaches into effective therapies, and highlights p53-based therapies via nanotechnology.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Imprinted genes are epigenetically regulated in normal tissues to follow monoallelic expression according to the parent of origin of each allele. Some of these patterns are dysregulated in cancer.


RESULTS
We developed a novel computational multi-omic pipeline to evaluate monoallelic and biallelic expression patterns based on matched RNA-seq expression data, whole-exome sequencing information, and copy number data. We analyzed allelic expression of the entire genes, individual isoforms, and each exon of 59,283 autosomal protein-coding and ncRNA genes, with a focus on 94 genes previously reported to be imprinted. We analyzed 108 cell lines from 9 different tumor histologies using molecular data from the DepMap Portal for the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Allelic expression patterns of imprinted genes and isoforms in tumor cells were variable. We also identified additional genes and isoforms with predominantly monoallelic expression due to a variety of potential mechanisms. We provide a novel public dataset of transcriptome-wide allelic expression patterns in cell lines from diverse tumor categories, which can serve as a resource for future cancer studies. We examined associations of in vitro cell line response to antitumor agents and repurposed drugs with allelic patterns and overall levels of isoform expression of imprinted genes and of additional genes with predominantly monoallelic expression. Drug response was associated with isoform expression patterns of multiple imprinted genes including CPA4, DGCR6, DNMT1, GNAS, GRB10, H19, NAA60, OSBPL5, PHACTR2, and ZFAT, predominantly monoallelically expressed MAP2K5 and BCLAF1, and additional predominantly monoallelically expressed genes. Multiple associations may be related to mechanisms of drug activity, including associations between the response to the DNA damaging agents and allelic expression of ZFAT, CDC27, and BCLAF1 isoforms, and the response to inhibitors of multiple signaling pathways with expression patterns of GNAS isoforms.


CONCLUSIONS
Tumor cells have a range of monoallelic and biallelic expression patterns in both imprinted and non-imprinted genes and are likely affected by the complex interplay among changes in allelic expression, sequence variants, copy number changes, and expression changes of biologically important genes. Multiple isoform-specific patterns of allelic expression were associated with drug response, indicating complex mechanisms of cancer chemoresistance.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a deadly disease known for its genetic heterogeneity. LTR12C is an endogenous retrovirus-derived regulator of pro-apoptotic genes and is normally silenced by epigenetic regulation. In this study, we found that the treatment of two glioblastoma cell lines, T98-G and U87-MG, with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors activated LTR12C expression. Combined treatment with these epigenetic drugs exerted a synergistic action on the LTR12C activation in both cell lines, while treatment with each drug as a single agent had a far weaker effect. A strong induction of the expression of the TP63 gene was seen in both cell lines, with the pro-apoptotic isoform GTA-p63 accounting for most of this increase. Coherently, downstream targets of p63, such as p21 and PUMA, were also induced by the combined treatment. Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction in the GBM cell growth and viability following the dual DNMT/HDAC inhibition. These findings reveal that the reactivation of LTR12C expression has the potential to modulate survival pathways in glioblastoma and provide information regarding possible epigenetic mechanisms that can be used to treat this deadly disease.">

        <tr id="The TP53 gene encodes the critical tumor suppressor p53, which is involved in the regulation of cell cycle control, apoptosis, and genomic stability. In cancer biology, p53 holds an elevated position because high mutation rates in the TP53 gene across human cancers lead to abnormal p53 protein. This would allow limitless replication of genetically damaged cells with malignant potential and so facilitate tumorigenesis. Normally referred to as the “guardian of the genome,” this protein assumes a central role in different cellular functions spanning metabolism through cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis to DNA repair mechanisms. Its significance extends beyond tumor suppression because it controls metabolic pathways that are central to maintaining homeostasis under normal physiological conditions. The normal functions of p53 as a tumor suppressor are abrogated by mutations; indeed, many such mutant forms act as oncogenes themselves when expressed in cancer cells. The review paper presents information from recent scientific investigations on the chemical structure of p53 protein and its mutations with a discussion on implications for cancer treatment. It also integrates various research findings to clarify the clinical effects of the p53 gene, especially in breast cancer and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and looks into changing treatment plans that focus on p53 problems.">

        <tr id="The field of hematology has experienced a substantial evolution with the acknowledgment of epigenetic processes as essential factors in the development of hematological malignancies. This review article examines the influence of epigenetic alterations, namely DNA methylation and histone modifications, on the onset and advancement of conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. We discuss how these epigenetic modifications lead to the deregulation of gene expression, eventually promoting leukemogenesis. The emergence of epigenetic therapies, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (e.g., azacitidine and decitabine), histone deacetylase inhibitors (e.g., vorinostat and romidepsin), and enhancer of zeste homologue 2 inhibitors (e.g., tazmetostat), demonstrates the potential to reverse aberrant epigenetic modifications and restoring normal cellular functions. Moreover, we highlight innovative therapeutic approaches, including combination therapies and CRISPR-based epigenetic editing tools, which are influencing the future of treatment for hematological malignancies. Despite promising results, challenges such as off-target effects, drug resistance, and the need for personalized approaches remain significant barriers to effective treatment. We emphasize that further study is required to improve delivery systems, comprehend resistance mechanisms and develop precision medicine strategies that can tailor therapies to individual patient profiles. By integrating benchside discoveries with clinical applications, this review aims to illuminate the transformative potential of epigenetic therapies in improving patient outcomes in hematology. Graphical abstract Epigenetic dysregulation including aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling is a key driver in the initiation and progression of hematologic malignancies. Therapeutic strategies targeting these epigenetic mechanisms aim to restore normal gene expression, induce differentiation, and overcome drug resistance.">

        <tr id="Elucidating the role of somatic mutations in cancer, healthy tissues, and aging depends on methods that can accurately characterize somatic mosaicism across different cell types, as well as assay their impact on cellular function. Current technologies to study cell-type-specific somatic mutations within tissues are low-throughput. We developed Duplex-Multiome, incorporating duplex consensus sequencing to accurately identify somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNV) from the same nucleus simultaneously analyzed for single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) and RNA-seq (snRNA-seq). By introducing strand-tagging into the construction of snATAC-seq libraries, duplex sequencing reduces sequencing error by >10,000-fold while eliminating artifactual mutational signatures. When applied to 98%/2% mixed cell lines, Duplex-Multiome identified sSNVs present in 2% of cells with 92% precision and accurately captured known sSNV mutational spectra, while revealing unexpected subclonal lineages. Duplex-Multiome of > 51,400 nuclei from postmortem brain tissue captured sSNV burdens and spectra across all major brain cell types and subtypes, including those difficult to assay by single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS). This revealed for the first time that diverse neuronal and glial cell types show distinct rates and patterns of age-related mutation, while also directly discovering developmental cell lineage relationships. Duplex-Multiome identified clonal sSNVs occurring at increased rates in glia of certain aged brains, as well as clonal sSNVs that correlated with changes in expression of nearby genes, in both neurotypical and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) individuals, directly demonstrating that somatic mutagenesis can contribute to gene expression phenotypes. Duplex-Multiome can be easily adopted into the 10X Multiome protocol and will bridge somatic mosaicism to a wide range of phenotypic readouts across cell types and tissues.">

 Although genetic variants associated with bladder cancer (BCa) risk have been identified through hypothesis-driven and genome-wide association studies, a systematic understanding of BCa genetic susceptibility at the gene and pathway levels remains to be achieved.



 In this 2-stage functional genomics study, we used 5 independent tools for genome-wide gene mapping and ranking based on BCa genome-wide association studies summary statistics, followed by a meta-analysis of gene-level significance p values, to obtain a consensus gene ranking in terms of association with BCa. Subsequently, we performed preranked gene-set enrichment analysis to identify the functional pathways involved in BCa genetic susceptibility. Joint analysis with gene-set enrichment analysis, based on somatic alteration frequency, was performed to explore the pathway-level relationships between genetic susceptibility and somatic alterations in BCa.



 Other than the well-known BCa genes (such as FGFR3, MYC, TERT, CCNE1, and TP63), we additionally prioritized a set of novel genes likely to be genetically implicated in BCa development, including SETD2, a possible tumor suppressor gene involved in chromatin remodeling. We further demonstrated convergence between genetic associations and somatic alterations at both the gene (eg, FGFR3 and TERT) and pathway levels (eg, cell cycle and chromatin modification), as well as functional ontologies specifically implicated in germline predisposition to BCa (eg, CD8/TCR signaling, immune checkpoints, and cytokine signaling).



 We identified several novel genes associated with BCa and demonstrated that genetic variants contribute to the development of BCa by affecting antitumor immunity, response to toxic exposure, and RNA and protein homeostasis and synergizing with somatic alterations in various cancer-related pathways.

        <tr id="Chromothripsis, a phenomenon of massive genomic rearrangements, introduces extensive mutations in critical genes, affecting cell survival and apoptosis. Among these genes, the BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) gene, which plays a crucial antiapoptotic role in cancer cells, is often subjected to significant alterations. Here, we present a computational pipeline to model and analyze the structural and functional impacts of chromothripsis-induced Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within the BCL2 gene. This pipeline integrates mutation simulation, homology modeling, and protein inter-action analysis to evaluate the stability and apoptotic potential of BCL2 mutations. These results indicate that chromothripsis-induced mutations can destabilize the Bcl-2 protein, thereby disrupting its binding affinity with apoptotic regulators, such as Bax. These findings support the potential of ergodic anticancer therapy to exploit such mutations, facilitating the apoptosis of cancer cells. Our computational model offers a novel in silico approach for understanding mutation-driven alterations in cancer biology, aiding the development of therapeutic strategies targeting apoptotic pathways.">

Although an expanded CAG allele is the causal mutation for HD, there is evidence that somatic expansion may not be the only disease driver. We report here that double strand breaks (DSBs) drive HD toxicity by an independent mechanism from somatic expansion. The mutant HD protein inhibits non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity, leading to the accumulation of DSBs. DSBs promote transcriptional pathology in mice that cannot expand their CAG tracts somatically. Conversely, Inhibition of DSBs reverses neuronal toxicity in animals that undergo somatic expansion. Although they coexist in neurons, DSBs and somatic expansion are independent therapeutic targets for HD.">

This review provides a comprehensive exploration of the molecular and genetic landscape of GBM, focusing on key oncogenic drivers, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which are critical for tumorigenesis and progression. We delve into the role of epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, in driving therapy resistance and tumor evolution. The tumor microenvironment is known for its pivotal role in immune evasion, with tumor-associated macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and regulatory T cells creating an immunosuppressive niche that sustains GBM growth. Emerging therapies, such as immunotherapies, oncolytic viral therapies, extracellular vesicle-based approaches, and non-coding RNA interventions, are highlighted as promising avenues to disrupt GBM pathogenesis. Advances in precision medicine and innovative technologies, including electric field therapy and locoregional treatments, are discussed for their potential to overcome the blood‒brain barrier and treatment resistance. Additionally, this review underscores the importance of metabolic reprogramming, particularly hypoxia-driven adaptations and altered lipid metabolism, in fueling GBM progression and influencing the therapeutic response. The role of glioma stem cells in tumor recurrence and resistance is also emphasized, highlighting the need for targeted therapeutic approaches. By integrating molecular targeting, immune energetics, and technological advancements, this review outlines a multidisciplinary framework for improving GBM treatment outcomes. Ultimately, the convergence of genetic, metabolic, and immune-based strategies offers transformative potential in GBM management, paving the way for increased patient survival and quality of life.">

        <tr id="The DNA repair protein RAD18 activates ‘Y-family’ Trans-Lesion Synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases that are DNA damage-tolerant and potentially error-prone. RAD18 is also frequently overexpressed and pathologically activated in cancer cells. However, the extent to which RAD18 shapes cancer genomes and impacts tumorigenesis is unclear. Therefore, we tested the effect of Rad18 status on chemically-induced and oncogene-driven tumorigenesis. In a chemically-induced oral carcinogenesis model, acute (2-16 days) 4NQO-treatment induces expression of Rad18 and TLS polymerase mRNAs in mouse oral epithelial cells prior to emergence of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). Chronic (8 week) 4NQO-treatment leads to onset of oral tumors that is accelerated in Rad18-/- mice when compared with Rad18+/+ animals. Analysis of OSCC genomes reveals increased levels of G(C)>T(A) transversions in Rad18-/- tumors when compared with Rad18+/+. Therefore, Rad18 promotes error-free bypass of 4NQO-induced DNA lesions and suppresses 4NQO-induced oral carcinogenesis. In a KrasG12D-induced lung carcinogenesis model, Rad18-deficiency did not affect rates or incidence of oncogene-induced lung tumors or mutations. Taken together, we demonstrate that Rad18 has context-specific tumor-suppressive activity. Given the prevalence of 4NQO-like environmental exposures, RAD18 is highly likely to shape human cancer genomes and perhaps influence other aspects of the tumorigenic process.">

 Background:
 Pancreatic cancer has apoor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. While
 K-RAS
 mutations are prevalent in this malignancy, a subset of patients harboring wild-type
 K-RAS
 presents distinct clinical behavior. Gene fusions have been discerned in pancreatic cancer and are promising candidates for administering targeted therapies.
 Methods:
 We conducted a retrospective analysis of 926 pancreatic cancer patients of which 165 (18%) carried a wild-type
 K-RAS
 gene, by next generation sequencing (NGS) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Tumors were analyzed with a clinical-grade hybrid capture-based RNA-seq clinical fusionome test, evaluating gene fusions between 1104 genes or to other known or novel partners as well as gene expression transcript analysis. Single nucleotide variants/insertions deletions (SNV/Indels) were tested with a clinical-grade NGS assay targeting > 300 cancer genes.
 Results:
 Gene fusions were detected in 32% of
 K-RAS
 wild-type pancreatic cancers, with 75% involving known oncogenic, clinically actionable genes including
 FGFR
 (two
 FGFR2
 and one
 FGFR1
 fusion), two
 NTRK3
 and one each of
 RAF1, RET, ROS1
 and
 BRAF
 fusions. Deleterious SNVs were frequently found in both fusion-positive and fusion-negative
 K-RAS
 wild-type pancreatic cancers. Transcriptomic expression revealed additional potentially druggable targets, e.g.,
 ROS1
 and
 FGFR3
 overexpression in a tumor harboring an
 NTRK3
 fusion,
 BRAF
 overexpression in the context of an otherwise non-actionable
 ETV6
 fusion, and
 MET
 overexpression in a
 TES::TFEC
 -fusion bearing cancer.
 Conclusions:
 Druggable fusions are frequent in
 K-RAS
 wild-type pancreatic cancers. Moreover, RNA fusion assays as well as transcriptomic expression testing can identify candidate personalized therapies for patients with
 K-RAS
 wild-type pancreatic cancer.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly resistant to chemotherapy. However, PDAC with germline BRCA mutations, which lead to homologous recombination (HR) deficiency (HRD), demonstrated an increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. This increased chemosensitivity was also seen in PDACs with germline or somatic mutations in the DNA double-strand damage response (DDR) genes beyond canonical HR genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2. However, there are no consensus methods to determine HRD status; and neither is there a well-defined list of HR-DDR genes. In addition, how HRD and/or HR-DDR gene mutation status impacts the tumor immune microenvironment including tumor mutation burden (TMB), neoantigen load, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, and effector T cell infiltration is unknown. Thus, in this study, we developed a new method to categorize PDACs into HRD-positive and HRD-negative subgroups by using results from whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, or both into consideration. We classified a cohort of 89 PDACs into HRD-positive (n = 18) and HRD-negative (n = 69) tumors. HR-DDR gene variants were identified more frequently in HRD-positive PDACs than HRD-negative PDACs, with RAD51B, BRCA2 and ATM alterations most frequently identified in HRD-positive PDACs. Notably, TMB and neoantigen load was significantly higher in HRD-positive PDACs compared to HRD-negative tumors. Interestingly, HRD-positive PDACs, PDACs with high tumor mutational burden, and PDAC with high neoantigen load were all associated with lower CD8 + T lymphocyte infiltration and T cell clonal diversity, suggesting a mechanism of resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Therefore, this study suggests that treatments to enhance effector T cell infiltration and T cell clonal diversity may overcome resistance to ICI-based immunotherapy in HRD-positive PDACs.

 Background:
 Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most common malignancy in young adult men, with a globally increasing incidence. While these tumors are highly curable due to their exceptional sensitivity to cisplatin (cDDP), a proportion of patients develops a resistance to this chemotherapy, which results in disease progression and patient death. The cause of cisplatin resistance in TGCT has not been elucidated yet and is supposed to be multifactorial.
 Methods:
 We conducted a CRISPR Knockout (KO) screening in a TGCT cell line (NCCIT) using a lentiviral sgRNAs library (Addgene #101926) targeting 3015 genes involved in cell cycle regulation and cancer development. The screening population was cultured with or without cDDP (1.25 uM) for 7 days. Samples of treated and control cells were harvested before and after cDDP exposure, the sgRNA cassettes were sequenced by massive parallel sequencing, and the differences in sgRNA abundance were determined using the MAGeCK/MAGeCK-Flute pipeline.
 Results:
 The CRISPR-KO screening data analysis identified 59 gene KOs that were significantly positively selected and 7 gene KOs that were significantly negatively selected after cDDP exposure. Among the top positive hits were genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis (
 BMF, CDIP1
 and
 BAX
 ), epigenetic modifiers (
 HDAC8, SSX2
 ), G-protein regulators (
 ADCY8, GNG10
 ), and others (e.g.
 MAGEA2, ACADM, LAMP1
 ) — inactivation of these genes potentially contributes to the development of cDDP resistance. Among the top negative hits were genes implicated in DNA damage repair (
 FANCB
 ,
 ERCC5
 ), sphingolipid metabolism (
 KDSR
 ), and cytokinesis (
 SPECC1L
 ) — inactivation of these genes may increase sensitivity to cDDP.
 Conclusions:
 The results highlight several potential mechanisms of cDPP resistance in TGCT. Some of these genes and pathways are well known and have been previously described in association with platinum resistance in malignant tumors, while others — such as the G-protein regulators, sphingolipid synthesis, and
 SPECC1L
 — are novel in this context and may reflect the unique biology of TGCT progression. SPECC1L is involved in spindle organization and microtubule stabilization; its paralog SPECC1 is highly expressed in testis. Polyenoic sphingolipids are essential for the completion of meiosis in male germ cells and spermatozoa production.

 ADCY8 controls the production of cAMP, which is a key signaling molecule in spermatogenesis. They have also been described in association with malignant proliferation and progression. The identified hits will be validated in subsequent experiments.

 Background: Large-scale genomic profiling has cataloged the prevalence of single base substitution (SBS) mutational signatures associated with the activity of Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) cytidine deaminases in breast cancer (BC). These mutational signatures are enriched in metastatic BC (mBC) compared to early tumors indicating an association with poor prognosis and a potential function in therapy resistance and disease progression. We sought out to investigate whether APOBEC3 mutational signatures can serve as biomarkers for poor treatment outcomes and if APOBEC3 mutagenesis-driven genomic instability can induce therapy resistance in mBC. Methods: We analyzed SBS mutational signatures in 3,880 BC samples with paired tumor-normal sequencing by the MSK-IMPACT assay using the SigMA algorithm. We utilized the detailed clinical annotation to assess the clinical characteristics of APOBEC3-dominant tumors including survival analyses on endocrine and targeted therapies. We generated cellular models of BC to investigate the molecular drivers of APOBEC3 mutagenesis and its function in promoting therapeutic resistance. We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of BC models and paired primary/metastatic patient samples to identify broader genomic alterations mediated by APOBEC3 activity. Results: Building on published results, we found that APOBEC3 mutational signatures were highly prevalent in all subtypes of BC and enriched in metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) compared to unmatched primary tumors (p < 0.0001 for HR+/HER2-, p < 0.01 for HR+/HER2+ and TNBC). APOBEC3 mutational signatures were independently associated with shorter progression-free survival on antiestrogen plus CDK4/6 inhibitor combination therapy in patients with HR+ mBC (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 - 1.8, p < 0.001). Expression of APOBEC3A (A3A) and APOBEC3B (A3B) enzymes generated APOBEC3-associated alterations including single nucleotide variants, copy number alterations (CNAs), and clustered mutations in a deamination-dependent manner, and promoted resistance acquisition of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BC cells to agents including an ER degrader and CDK4/6 inhibitors. In HER2+ cells, endogenous A3A-driven APOBEC3 activity was also necessary for faster resistance development against anti-HER2 therapies. WGS analyses of resistant models identified CNA events such as loss of heterozygosity in chromosome 13 exclusively in APOBEC3-positive cells. Upon exposure to the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib, these cells acquired APOBEC3-context truncating mutations in RB1 tumor suppressor gene, a well-characterized mechanism of resistance. Detailed analyses of WGS of five paired patient samples also highlighted acquired resistance-linked alterations such as PIK3CA E54XK mutations in APOBEC3-dominant tumors, which were corroborated in paired pre/post-treatment samples in our clinical cohort. The acquisition of APOBEC3-context alterations in APOBEC3-dominant samples highlights the causality of APOBEC3 mutagenesis in driving resistance-promoting changes. Lastly, comparison of mutational signatures in the paired cohort demonstrated pre-existence of APOBEC3 signatures in 75% of pre-treatment samples that became APOBEC3-dominant post-treatment illustrating that APOBEC3 mutagenesis can be active during early stages of BC. Conclusions: Our work reveals that APOBEC3 mutational signatures predict poor treatment outcomes of HR+ mBC. We demonstrate that APOBEC3 mutagenesis, primarily through the enzymatic activity of A3A and A3B, drives resistance to endocrine and targeted therapies by causing APOBEC3-context resistance-associated changes. We further show that the presence of APOBEC3 mutagenesis can be detected before therapy exposure and may therefore represent a valuable biomarker and therapeutic target.

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BC) is a highly prevalent malignancy in women and is often resistant to available therapies, calling for urgent investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis and progression. BC is thought to result from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Among key factors, chronic stress has been associated with worse cancer outcomes and can profoundly impact the epigenome. However, both stress and BC phenotypes are complex and heterogeneous, making studies that examine their molecular links challenging. Despite their heterogeneity, stressors trigger a neuroendocrine response that in humans culminates in the release of cortisol, a highly lipophilic hormone that traverses essentially every cell and induces widespread genomic effects. Modeling such effects at the epigenetic level, here we examine whether cellular DNA methylation (DNAm) markers of chronic stress – derived from human fibroblasts undergoing prolonged exposure to physiological stress cortisol levels – distinguish BC phenotypes in two independent human cohorts. Our results show that methylomic signatures of stress are consistently higher in tumor samples as compared to normal samples and in more advanced tumor stages and grades. Follow-up analyses further identify specific DNAm sites driving these associations, which are significantly enriched for cell adhesion pathways in both cohorts. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms linking stress with BC and a proof-of-concept for utilizing cell model-derived disease biomarkers in environmental epigenetics.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its pronounced cellular heterogeneity, therapy resistance, and metastatic propensity, traits driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs). Once thought to be a rare, static subpopulation, CSCs are now recognized as a dynamic, plastic cell state influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In this review, we explore the “inner” (genetic, cellular, and metabolic) and “outer” (microenvironmental and macroenvironmental) determinants that govern CSC identity, emergence, and evolution in PDAC. We focus on how acinar and ductal cell plasticity, in combination with oncogenic mutations (e.g., KRAS, TP53), contribute to tumor initiation and CSC generation, how genomic instability further fuels CSC heterogeneity and adaptability, and we highlight how micro and macro TME properties, metabolism and external factors regulate CSC behavior afterwards. Altogether, CSCs exist at the nexus of genetic chaos and environmental cues. Understanding this complex interplay is key to developing therapies that not only eradicate CSCs but also prevent their reemergence. While still far from clinical application, disrupting CSC-supportive networks should be a research and clinical focus for improving outcomes for PDAC patients.">

 Background:
 Histone lactylation, a newly identified epigenetic modification, has been extensively implicated in the initiation and progression of tumors. However, the precise role of histone lactylation in modulating tumor cell responses to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity remains insufficiently explored.
 Methods:
 To elucidate the adaptive changes tumor cells undergo in response to T cell-induced cytotoxicity within the tumor microenvironment (TME), we performed a comprehensive, genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen. This approach facilitated the identification of genetic alterations in lung cancer cells co-cultured with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that promote their evasion of T cell-mediated destruction. Complementary RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells modulate their response to T cell-mediated killing, particularly following the deletion of the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1).
 Results:
 MCT1 deletion significantly heightened the cancer-cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing. Furthermore, the loss of MCT1 led to mitochondrial dysfunction within the tumor cells. Mechanistically, MCT1 knockout resulted in a reduction of histone H3K18 lactylation and downregulation of ferridoxin reductase (FDXR), which disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis and precipitated mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, the combination of MCT1 inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy substantially enhanced ICB efficacy, prolonged survival in both lung cancer and malignant pleural effusion (MPE) murine models, and alleviated the immunosuppressive milieu within the TME.
 Conclusions:
 Our findings reveal a novel role for lactate metabolism in modulating mitochondrial dysfunction and anti-tumor immunity, with lactylation-mediated regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis serving as a critical mechanism. These results provide new insights into the epigenetic regulation of tumorigenesis and highlight potential immune-metabolic strategies for targeted lactate metabolism therapies in the treatment of lung cancer and MPE.

        <tr id="BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BRAF/MEKi) have radically changed the treatment landscape of advanced BRAF mutation-positive tumours. However, limited efficacy and emergence of drug resistance are major barriers for successful treatments. Here, by using relevant preclinical models, we find that Connexin43 (Cx43), a protein that plays a role in cell-to-cell communication, enhances the effectiveness of BRAF/MEKi by recruiting DNA repair complexes to lamin-associated domains and promoting persistent DNA damage and cellular senescence. The nuclear compartmentalization promoted by Cx43 contributes to genome instability and synthetic lethality caused by excessive DNA damage, which could provide a therapeutic approach for these tumours to overcome drug resistance. Based on these findings, we designed a drug combination using small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) to deliver the full-Cx43 in combination with the BRAF/MEKi. This study reveals Cx43 as a regulator of DNA repair and BRAF/MEKi response, highlighting the therapeutic potential that this approach could eventually have in the clinic to overcome the limitations of current therapies and improve treatment outcomes for patients with advanced BRAF mutant tumours.">

        <tr id="How the host immune system loses its surveillance function during the evolution from normal cell to malignancy is still largely unknown. Here, we investigate the dynamics changes of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor microenvironment by profiling 132,115 single-cell transcriptomes derived from 51 tissues, including healthy pancreatic tissue, non-metastatic PDAC primary tumors, metastatic primary tumors, and patient-matched liver metastases. The cellular proportion, bio-functional, and interaction between each cell type are carefully characterized. Aberrant copy number variations (CNVs) indicating malignant intensity are identified at chromosomes 7 and 20 of epithelial cells during tumor development. A bio-functional transition of predominant genes from physiology to pancreatic oncogenesis and metastasis is observed. Combinatorial analysis of epithelial cells and immunocytes indicates a gradient loss of immune surveillance during the malignant transformation. By dissecting cellular interaction, we unravel an incremental tumor cell-triggered apoptosis of DCs through molecular pair ANXA1-FPR1/3. Consequently, the activation and infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are dampened progressively. Remarkably, we unveil a novel subtype of stress-response NK cells (strNK), which are characterized by robust proliferation, diminished cytolytic capabilities, and negative immune regulation. Notably, the presence of strNK cells is associated with poor prognosis of PDAC patients, implying a potential pro-tumor function. Taken together, our results not only shed light on the intricate mechanisms underlying step-wise evasion of immune surveillance during PDAC tumor development, but also provide a potential strategy for holding back malignant transition by reinforcing DCs’ function.">

        <tr id="Abstract Extensively studied over the past four decades, the TP53 gene has emerged as a pivotal watchman in cellular defense and a key factor in cancer biology. TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human malignancies, 50% of which carry alterations to it. Initially, the functions of p53 were thought to be restricted to cell‐cycle arrest and apoptosis. With time, however, a growing number of functions have been discovered, illustrating p53's role as a master switch between any cellular stress and cellular or multicellular responses that contribute to its anti‐tumor activity. Indeed, the peculiar landscape of TP53 mutations and its high heterogeneity are linked both to the structure of the protein and its ubiquitous function in regulating cellular homeostasis. Mutations in p53 are associated with poor response to therapy and shorter survival in most cancer types, and the diagnosis of p53 mutations is currently used to improve case management in some types of leukemia and lymphoma. Although TP53 has been defined as a tumor suppressor gene, overexpressed mutated p53 variants found in human tumors are defined as dominant oncogenes with a potential gain of function, which makes the gene a very attractive target for developing new cancer treatments. Beyond its role in cancer, our review also highlights TP53's significance in non‐neoplastic conditions, such as bone marrow failure syndromes and certain developmental disorders, where chronic p53 activation plays a crucial role in cellular stress responses, demonstrating its broader biological importance.">

        <tr id="The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been harnessed and repurposed into a powerful genome editing tool. By leveraging this technology, researchers can precisely cut, paste, and even rewrite DNA sequences within living cells. Nevertheless, the application of CRISPR screen technology goes far beyond mere experimentation. It serves as a pivotal tool in the fight against genetic diseases, systematically dissecting complex genetic landscapes, empowering researchers to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying biological phenomena, and enabling scientists to identify and target the root causes of illnesses such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia. Among all, cancer poses a formidable challenge for medicine, spurring eradication efforts. Radiotherapy, as a traditional treatment, yields results but has limitations. It eradicates cancer cells but also damages healthy tissues, causing adverse effects that reduce quality of life. Additionally, not all cancer cells respond to radiotherapy, and some may develop resistance, worsening the condition. To address this, a comprehensive whole-genome CRISPR screen technology is introduced, as it enables the efficient identification of radiosensitive and radioresistant genes, thereby advancing the field of cancer research and treatment. A genome-wide CRISPR screen was conducted in lung adenocarcinoma cells exposed to irradiation following the described protocol, through which both radioresistance- and radiosensitivity-associated genes were identified.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2, which drove the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic, continues to engender inquiries into the role of host genetic factors in disease susceptibility. Despite the identification of over 1,000 genes potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, the mechanisms connecting genetic variants to phenotype remain elusive. To shed light on these mechanisms, we undertook an integrated analysis, merging data from whole-genome association analyses of COVID-19 with methylome and transcriptomic. Methods: Study includes African American adults from the GENE-FORECAST study, encompassing 371 individuals with whole genome sequencing (WGS), 203 with DNA methylation, and 321 with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of blood. 53.3% of participants reported COVID-19. Significant loci associated with COVID-19 were examined within the framework of methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) which located near the gene-of-original (cis-mQTL) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) which located near the gene-of-origin (cis-eQTL), enabling analysis to assess mediators between genetic variants and COVID-19 status. Results: Our analysis identified four intronic variants and confirmed a missense variant, rs1052067, in PMF1 associated with COVID-19. Causal mediation analysis revealed that the combination of genetic variants within PMF1, epigenomics, and transcriptomics mapped four pathways influencing COVID-19 status. These pathways include: rs9659072 -> DNAm at chr1:156285845 (annotated to TMEM79) -> ENSG00000198715:13 (annotated to GLMP); rs12083543 -> DNAm at chr1:155951748 (ARHGEF2) -> ENSG00000198715:13 (GLMP); rs1052067 -> DNAm at chr1:155951748 (ARHGEF2)-> ENSG00000198715:13 (GLMP); rs1543294 -> ENSG00000198715:13 (GLMP) -> DNAm at chr1:156077518 (MEX3A). Conclusions: Through integrated multi-omics analyses, we identified genetic variants whose effects on COVID-19 susceptibility are mediated by changes in DNA methylation and mRNA expression. These findings offer insights into potential mechanistic pathways that merit further exploration.">

 Background:
 Cells possess a complex DNA damage response (DDR) system to prevent detrimental mutations from accumulating. The genes encoding various DDR components are frequently mutated in cancer cells and provide potential sites for therapeutic intervention. DNA damaging agents, with one exception, are repaired by the global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) pathway. Our novel class of drugs, Illudins, are the exception as Illudin-induced DNA damage is not recognized by GG-NER and can only be repaired by the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway. Studies utilizing isogeneic cell lines completely deficient in specific TC-NER proteins (e.g. homozygous ERCC6 knockout) indicate these cells are extremely sensitive to Illudins (up to 30-fold). In contrast, cells deficient in GG-NER activity are not sensitive to our drugs. Moreover, non-replicating or normal cells are minimally affected by Illudins, as evidenced by the lack of systemic toxicity in humans treated with one of our drugs. In TC-NER deficient cancer cells, however, our drug ITX-0121 blocks the TC-NER polymerase complex, which disengages from DNA, and initiates the irreversible process of apoptosis or cellular suicide. Many cancers exhibit deficiencies in DDR mechanisms and cannot properly repair DNA damage.
 Methods:
 Analysis of the GENIE Database indicates that the overall incidence of TC-NER deficient cancers in solid tumors is ~10%, and includes all major histological classifications (breast, ovarian, endometrial, prostate, renal, bladder, bone, colorectal, liver, lung, skin, pancreatic, thyroid, etc.) or ~175,000 new patients annually. These cancers, however, possess monoallelic mutations, as opposed to biallelic, and thus have some residual TC-NER functionality. To determine the relative sensitivity of cancers with monoallelic alterations in TC-NER genes, we generated colorectal HCT-116 cells with a monoallelic deletion in a single TC-NER gene. For example, we are generating daughter cell lines with small monoallelic deletions in ERCC2, ERCC3, ERCC4, ERCC6, and ELOF1 genes.
 Results:
 We are comparing sensitivity of these daughter lines to our lead drug ITX-0121, as well as to other DNA damaging agents such as cisplatin. Preliminary results indicate a monoallelic alteration in a TC-NER gene can confer > 6-fold sensitivity to ITX-0121, which is clinically relevant based on PK results. Based on these PK results, we believe the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ITX-0121 in patients to be > 1.2 mg/kg; yet only 0.4 mg/kg will be sufficient for clinical efficacy against cancers that are phenotypically TC-NER deficient.
 Conclusions:
 Thus, despite the administration of a cytotoxic agent, TC-NER deficient cancer patients can be treated at a non-toxic dose; if toxicity occurs, it should be limited to transient thrombocytopenia, as indicated by prior studies.

        <tr id="DNA methylation is the best-known epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Its counterpart, known as DNA demethylation, is equally important and enables the activation of previously silenced genes. DNA demethylation has attracted interest in the scientific community following the landmark discovery that Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) proteins can convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. A growing body of research indicates that changes in TET protein levels and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine content are hallmarks of cancer. These epigenetic changes appear to play a critical role in the development of malignancies characterized by high levels of somatic mutations and genetic instability. Bladder cancer is among the most common cancers worldwide and, despite aggressive treatment, remains associated with high mortality and poor prognosis. The lack of reliable diagnostic and prognostic markers poses a significant challenge in its management, highlighting the urgent need for novel biomarkers to enable earlier diagnosis and more accurate prediction of clinical outcomes. This review examines epigenetic alterations associated with bladder cancer and their clinical implications. We focus on the impact of DNA methylation and demethylation on oncogene regulation, summarize scientific evidence supporting their role in bladder cancer development and progression, and briefly explore novel therapeutic strategies targeting those epigenetic mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Canine malignant insulinoma is a rare, highly metastatic and life-threatening neuroendocrine tumour of pancreatic beta cells. To map the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of canine insulinoma for the first time, transcriptomic profiles of 5,532 cells were captured from two spontaneous insulinomas (Patient 1 and 2) and one associated metastasis (Patient 2) in two Boxer dogs. Distinct cancer, endocrine, and immune cell populations were identified. Notably, all three tumour samples contained two transcriptionally distinct insulin-expressing tumour cell populations (INS+ and INS+FOSlow), characterised here for the first time. These two cancer cell populations significantly differed by ~ 8,000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), particularly tumour suppressor genes (e.g. TP53, EGR1) and cancer-related pathways (e.g., MAPK, p53). In contrast, COX7A2L was one of a few genes ubiquitously expressed and significantly upregulated (> 20-fold) in both insulin-expressing tumour populations compared to other captured populations. Both populations were also characterised by expression of chromogranin/secretogranin neuroendocrine tumour marker genes (e.g. CHGA, SCGN). There were far fewer gene expression differences observed between insulin-expressing tumour cells from the two patients (~ 600 DEGs) than between the two cancer cell populations within each patient. These DEGs included CLTRN, TMSB4X, CSRP2, LGALS2, and C15orf48. Unexpectedly for a tumour of endocrine origin, the metastasis in Patient 2 exhibited > 20–70 fold upregulation of exocrine pancreatic genes including CLPS, PRSS2, PRSS and CTRC. Immune cell analyses identified distinct infiltrating immune populations, including memory T cells and macrophages and revealed likely tumour-immune interactions, including the CD40-CD40L interaction. This study provides the first single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of naturally occurring insulinoma in any species, revealing tumour cell heterogeneity, novel immune microenvironment features, and potential therapeutic targets. Despite its small scale, the findings highlight the utility of scRNA-seq in veterinary oncology and its translational potential for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours across species.

 Background:
 Sarcomas are rare, heterogeneous, and aggressive malignancies with poor prognosis, driven by dysregulated proliferation pathways (e.g., CDK4/6, c-Myc) and impaired tumor suppression mechanisms (e.g., CDKN2A/p16INK4a-RB, p14ARF-MDM2-p53). These genetic alterations result in uncontrolled growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Emerging therapies targeting these pathways, such as CDK4/6 inhibitors and MDM2 antagonists, show promise. Furthermore, genomic testing can provide insights into mesenchymal stem cell-derived sarcomagenesis and oncogenic microenvironmental interactions providing new opportunities for precision-based treatments. This study investigates molecular pathways in aggressive sarcomas which could assist in expanding targeted treatment options beyond the current common genetic fusions.
 Methods:
 Retrospectively, we investigated the comprehensive genomic profiling of 10 sarcoma patients including subtypes leiomyosarcoma(n=2), ewing sarcoma(n=1), metastatic angiosarcoma(n=2), extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma(n=1), pleomorphic liposarcoma(n=1), retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma(n=1), soft tissue sarcoma(n=1) and differentiated spindle cell sarcoma(n=1) at different disease stages including progressive, metastatic, and recurrent disease types. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) test was performed using OncoIndx Assay (Shafi et al., 2024).
 Results:
 The study cohort comprised 10 sarcoma patients, including males (n=6) and females (n=4). Disease stages included progressive (n=4), metastatic (n=3), and recurrent (n=3), as identified through PET scans and histopathological examination (HPE). Recent therapeutic regimen predominantly included chemotherapy (Eribulin, Palliative chemo, Trabectedin, Gem + Docetaxel), combined therapy (Paclitaxel + Pembro, Pazopanib + DCT), and surgery. Primary genomic findings highlighted the impairment of two critical pathways including cell proliferation (n=3/10) and tumor suppression (n=4/10). Further, no genomic alteration was detected in three patients despite aggressive disease as per PET/HPE findings. In addition, genomic findings from three patients also exhibited a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) thereby expanding their possibilities to immunotherapy.
 Conclusions:
 This study highlights the utility of comprehensive genomic profiling in broadening the scope of treatment by highlighting the exact drivers for and disease aggressiveness in sarcomas. The presence of genomic alterations in cell proliferation and tumor suppression pathways could also be early indicators of disease aggressiveness if closely monitored. With only a few selected fusions currently crucial in sarcomas, this study extends the molecular repertoire for practice. Also, additional analysis like RNA sequencing might be more beneficial in such scenarios.

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer (OC) is a leading cause of death of gynecological cancers in women. Poor patient response to treatment highlights the need to better understand how the tumor microenvironment affects OC progression. Growing evidence indicates the crucial role of non-cancerous components, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts, in establishing a complex network of cellular and molecular interactions, influencing cancer progression and response to treatment. Therefore, in this study, we sought to characterize the impact of fibroblasts on OC cell behavior and drug response. Using both direct and indirect cell co-culture systems, we observed distinct changes in cancer cell proliferation, morphology, and secretome in the presence of fibroblasts. Furthermore, an imaging-based high-throughput drug screen of 528 oncology compounds revealed multiple drugs that showed altered efficacy in the co-culture conditions, demonstrating the role of fibroblasts in driving cancer cell resistance to treatment. Most importantly, our data identified the two drug combinations of Birinapant or Vorinostat with Carboplatin as promising treatments, exploiting the altered cancer cell phenotype in co-cultures. These findings were supported by the increased sensitivity of ex vivo cultures to these combinations.">

        <tr id="Traditional approaches for capturing genomic alterations and DNA methylation require separate assays, complicating clinical workflows and limiting sample utilization, particularly with low-input materials like cell-free DNA. To address these challenges, we introduce a streamlined approach combining mutation and methylation profiling via mutation-protective strand synthesis with modified deoxycytidine triphosphates, demonstrating high concordance with standard enzymatic methyl-seq and DNA-seq in both whole-genome sequencing of cell lines and targeted sequencing of clinical samples. In potential clinical contexts, incorporating multi-omics information with this approach modestly improve circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection by ~12% in pre-treatment lung cancer patients (N = 26) while preserving specificity in healthy controls (N = 13), and reveal relationships between homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene function and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) mediated by promoter methylation-driven biallelic loss of HRR genes in gynecologic cancer patients (N = 27). For practical convenience, this method was also implemented on qPCR platform with high performance (0.5% limit of detection). With its adaptability and potential utility in ctDNA detection and treatment, this approach holds promise for advancing clinical diagnostics.">

        <tr id="Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern, impacting over half a million women annually. The primary cause is a persistent infection with hr-HPV, which disrupts various cellular processes crucial for normal function. This disruption leads to genetic instability, including changes in the expression of microRNAs and their corresponding host genes, with far-reaching consequences for cellular regulation. Researchers have widely utilized high-throughput technologies to analyze gene expression in cervical cancer, aiming to identify distinct molecular signatures of microRNAs and genes through genomic analysis. However, discrepancies among studies have been noted, possibly due to variations in sample collection, technological platforms, and data processing methods such as normalization and filtering. Therefore, it is essential to synthesize findings from diverse studies to comprehensively understand the molecular mechanisms of regulatory genetic networks involved in the initiation and progression of cervical cancer. This review examined the evidence detailing the role of microRNA signatures and their target genes in cervical carcinogenesis and disease advancement. The accumulated data suggest the presence of widespread regulatory genetic networks active in both precancerous and cancerous cervical cells, potentially acting as key drivers of this malignancy. Identifying these molecular genomic signatures could open new avenues for developing therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer, particularly in the realm of precision medicine.">

This is partly caused by the overuse of Chemotherapeutic drugs against Cancer, leading to its potency. Cancer starts with an accumulation of genetic mutations in the genome, and the ignorance to cell checks by CD8 and NK cells. The Cancer cell utilizes its hallmark capabilities and uses one of its cells to metastasizes in other areas of the body either through the perineural, circulatory, or lymphatic system. p53 is a tumor suppressor gene which repairs the mutations of the cell by conducting cell cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis. However, cancer cells can increase the expression of SB100 which can inhibit p53. One solution is to combine PRIMA-1 and CDDP which restores p53 and it’s wild type functions to induce apoptosis.

 Background:
 NAMPT and TIGAR, present in exosomes derived from pulsed dendritic cells (DEX), are key regulators of tumor metabolism and immune modulation. NAMPT catalyzes the biosynthesis of NAD+, crucial in regulating cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell survival, and apoptosis. TIGAR, on the other hand, modulates apoptosis and maintains the redox balance in cells, impacting tumor cell survival and resistance to therapy. The role of both NAMPT and TIGAR in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for understanding how tumors manipulate metabolic and immune pathways to support their growth and resistance.This study examines how these proteins drive metabolic shifts and immune responses in complex tumors, emphasizing their potential in scalable, personalized therapies for aggressive, therapy-resistant cancers.
 Methods:
 DEX were generated using optimized pulses in semi-immortalized dendritic cells and processed under fresh, cryopreserved, and lyophilized conditions. NAMPT and TIGAR identification and quantification were performed by mass spectrometry (timsTOF Pro 2) with > 98% specific coverage. ZR-75-30 (breast) and HT-29 (colon) tumor cell lines were treated with 10, 50, and 100 µg/mL for 72 hours. Key cytokines (IL-12, IL-10, IFN-γ) were assessed by Cytometric Bead Array (CBA), and apoptosis was evaluated via Annexin V/PI staining and caspase-3 activation.
 Results:
 Quantification of NAMPT and TIGAR: o NAMPT: Fresh 18.9 ± 0.5 ng/mL vs Lyophilized 18.2 ± 0.4 ng/mL (p > 0.05). o TIGAR: Fresh 23.1 ± 0.7 ng/mL vs Lyophilized 22.4 ± 0.6 ng/mL (p > 0.05). Modulation of TME: o Increase in IL-12 (+57.8% ± 2.1, p < 0.001) and IFN-γ (+55.1% ± 1.8, p < 0.001). o Decrease in IL-10 (-42.4% ± 1.7, p < 0.01). Tumor Apoptosis: o ZR-75-30: 48.1% ± 2.9 apoptosis (lyophilized) vs 31.2% ± 2.1 (cryopreserved, p < 0.01). o HT-29: 46.5% ± 3.1 apoptosis (lyophilized) vs 29.7% ± 2.4 (cryopreserved, p < 0.01).
 Conclusions:
 NAMPT and TIGAR in DEX stand out as key modulators of the tumor microenvironment, promoting immune modulation and apoptosis in metabolically active and immunosuppressive tumors. Their high functional stability under lyophilization ensures the clinical viability of these exosomes in personalized therapies for pediatric, adolescent, and elderly patients. Lyophilized DEX, which preserve the activity of NAMPT and TIGAR, could serve as a transformative tool in clinical oncology, especially in precision medicine. By stabilizing these critical proteins, DEX-based therapies provide a promising route for overcoming resistance to conventional cancer treatments. This approach represents a significant advancement in precision oncology, establishing DEX as an essential and scalable therapeutic tool, making them accessible to underserved patient populations in both developed and resource-limited settings, thus broadening the impact of personalized treatments globally.

        <tr id="Background Cervical cancer (CC) remains a significant global health challenge despite advancements in screening, HPV vaccination, and therapeutic strategies. Tumor heterogeneity, driven by epigenetic modifications, affects immune evasion, metastasis, and treatment response. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in CC progression and therapy resistance. Single-cell sequencing offers new insights but remains underutilized in CC research. This study integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and deconvolution analysis to identify key genes and immunotherapy targets. By constructing a prognostic model and exploring the immune microenvironment, we aim to provide novel insights into CC pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies. Methods We utilized scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, deconvolution analysis, and pseudotime trajectory mapping to delineate fibroblast subtypes within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of CC. Functional annotations, differential gene expression profiling, cell–cell communication pathways, and transcription factor networks were systematically analyzed. A prognostic model based on bulk RNA-seq data was constructed and validated through survival analysis, with correlations to immune microenvironment characteristics. Functional experiments investigated the role of SDC1, a critical mediator of fibroblast-tumor crosstalk. Additionally, Fibroblast–tumor cell co-culture systems and functional assays were employed to investigate the paracrine role of SDC1. The CAF MYH11⁺ subpopulation was isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Multiplex immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on both cultured cells and human cervical cancer tissue samples to characterize the spatial distribution and dynamic remodeling of MYH11 during stromal reorganization. Results Six distinct fibroblast subtypes were identified, including the C0 MYH11 + fibroblasts, which exhibited unique roles in stemness maintenance, metabolic activity, and immune regulation. Spatial and functional analyses revealed that the C0 subtype is central to tumor-fibroblast interactions, particularly through the MDK-SDC1 signaling axis. The prognostic model incorporating fibroblast-specific markers demonstrated robust predictive power for patient survival outcomes. Additionally, in vitro SDC1 knockdown significantly inhibited CC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Fibroblasts show spatially regulated heterogeneity, with activation markers enriched in the tumor zone and MYH11 highest in normal zones, indicating dynamic stromal remodeling. C0 MYH11 + CAF Promotes Tumor Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Inhibits Apoptosis via Soluble SDC1. Conclusion Our results illustrate, in some ways, the possible immunomodulatory and tumor supporting roles of CAFs in CC TIME and highlight the possibility that the MDK-SDC1 pathway is a promising therapeutic target. This study not only promotes a partially new understanding of temporal heterogeneity in CC, but also provides a possible reference base for the development of new biomarkers and immunotherapy approaches to improve clinical outcomes.

        <tr id="One of the strongest signatures of aging is an accumulation of mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy. Here we investigate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon by calling mtDNA sequence, abundance, and heteroplasmic variation in human blood using whole genome sequences from ∼750,000 individuals. Our analyses reveal a simple, two-step mechanism: first, individual cells randomly accumulate low levels of “cryptic” mtDNA mutations; then, when a cell clone proliferates, the cryptic mtDNA variants are carried as passenger mutations and become detectable in whole blood. Four lines of evidence support this model: (1) the mutational spectrum of age-accumulating mtDNA variants is consistent with a well-established model of mtDNA replication errors, (2) these mutations are found primarily at low levels of heteroplasmy and do not show evidence of positive selection, (3) high mtDNA mutation burden tends to co-occur in samples harboring somatic driver mutations for clonal hematopoiesis (CH), and (4) nuclear GWAS reveals that germline variants predisposing to CH (such as those near TERT, TCL1A, and SMC4) also increase mtDNA mutation burden. We propose that the high copy number and high mutation rate of mtDNA make it a particularly sensitive blood-based marker of CH. Importantly, our work helps to mechanistically unify three prominent signatures of aging: common germline variants in TERT, clonal hematopoiesis, and observed mtDNA mutation accrual.">

        <tr id="The development of multiple myeloma is typically associated with various cytogenetic abnormalities; however, these genetic changes alone do not fully account for the observed heterogeneity in patient prognosis and treatment response. Recent studies leveraging next-generation sequencing and genomic approaches have shown that epigenetic alterations are crucial in myeloma development and therapeutic resistance. These changes contribute to high levels of transcriptomic instability and enables cellular adaptation to targeted therapies and immunotherapies through diverse evolutionary trajectories. In this regard, aberrations of histone modifications and chromatin remodeling affect various cellular processes such as DNA repair, DNA damage response, cellular survival, and apoptosis signaling, which provides a strong rationale for developing epigenetic-targeted therapies for myeloma treatment. In this review, we focus on recent advances and research gaps in understanding the deregulation of histone acetylation, a widespread and versatile process of histone modification occurring at lysine residues at the N-terminus of histone tails, and its intimate interplay with chromatin remodeling complexes in orchestrating dynamic chromatin functional states and transcriptional outputs. We also provide an updated review of epigenetic modulatory drugs targeting HDAC, CBP/p300, and bromodomain and extraterminal proteins, along with a discussion of their limitations and future perspectives in myeloma treatment.">

Hence, much like in the treatment of adult cancers, molecular profiling is now routinely utilized in clinical workflows for pediatric cancers as a companion to conventional pathology diagnosis. Many variants of unknown significance identified through DNA profiling are being characterized by saturation genome editing, enabled by CRISPR editing technology and clever functional assays. Newer technologies and analytics are revealing additional structural complexity around cancer drivers and gene fusions in pediatric cancer DNA.

 Cancer treatment options including small molecules, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), CAR T-cells, and combination therapies are rapidly expanding to improve cancer patient survival. However, efficacy of targeted therapies is limited by interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneity in breast cancer, and may be further exacerbated by dysregulated tumor microenvironments. For example, studies suggested that changes in tumor and breast tissue microenvironment in obesity (e.g. inflammation, increased growth factors) could lead to worsened prognosis that could be related to therapy resistance. Systematic characterization of the cellular effects of emerging drug candidates, particularly across different tumor microenvironments, is challenging, as it needs to be surveyed in diverse cancer contexts beyond just a handful of cancer cell lines. To overcome this challenge, we created PRISM (Profiling Relative Inhibition Simultaneously in Mixtures), an effective drug discovery screening platform with over 900 genetically distinct cancer cell lines of diverse lineages, to rapidly test therapeutics in a high-throughput manner. These cell lines, including 33 different breast cancer cell lines covering diverse cell types and subgroups, carry a specific 24 nucleotide “barcode” tag and have rich baseline genomic and functional characterization. They are first pooled into 20-25 cell pools of different lineages with similar growth rates, then subsequently cultured together with or without drugs. The relative barcode quantity read out by NextGen sequencing determines cell line responses to drugs. This pooled approach significantly reduces the time and the resources required for drug screening. Importantly, utilizing the rich cell line characterization to interpret viability profiles enables the identification of drivers of differential sensitivity and potential biomarkers of compound response. Furthermore, we created a breast cancer cell specific pool to investigate how media conditions mirroring different tumor microenvironments [e.g. media filtration, addition of insulin (0.01 mg/mL) or EGF (0.01 ug/mL)] can impact drug effects on breast cancer cells. In the PRISM 900+ cell panel treated with ADCs conjugated to different payloads that target HER2, there was a clear association between cell line sensitivity and ERBB2 (encoding HER2) gene expression, with the strongest effects on viability observed in a subset of cell lines overexpressing ERBB2. Upon further comparison of biomarker profiles across different ADCs, we established relationships between payload resistance and ABCB1 efflux pumps emerged for a subset of ADC payloads. Using the breast cancer cell specific pool, our data showed that estrogen receptor (ER) degraders fulvestrant and vepdegestrant (ARV-471) had significantly greater effects in reducing viability of ER+ versus ER- breast cancer cell lines. Media filtering reduced the drug effects of fulvestrant but not ARV-471, suggesting that ARV-471 efficacy may be less sensitive to the tumor microenvironment than fulvestrant. Lapatinib (HER2/neu and EGF receptor inhibitor) was more effective in killing HER2+ than HER2- negative breast cancer cells, with cells cultured in EGF-spiked media being more sensitive to lapatinib, whereas media filtration diminished its effects. We did not observe breast cancer subgroup specific killing by alpelisib (PI3K inhibitor) or olaparib (PARP inhibitor), but breast cancer cells became less sensitive to alpelisib when cultured in either insulin- or EGF-spiked media, and less sensitive to olaparib in EGF-spiked media. Overall, our study highlights how the PRISM 900+ cell panel can provide insights into drug specificity, cancer subtype selectivity, and to uncover clinically relevant targets. The breast cancer specific pool can further increase the throughput of understanding how drug responses may be altered in different tumor microenvironments in breast cancer.

TP53TG1 modulates gene expression by several mechanisms, including “competitive RNA” activity, competitive miRNA binding, control of critical signaling pathways, and facilitation of epigenetic changes. TP53TG1 affects tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis through intricate mechanisms, modifies tumor cells resistance to therapies, influences the tumor immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming, and may present various avenues for clinical therapeutic intervention. Notwithstanding considerable advancements in comprehending the molecular function of TP53TG1, some challenges persist, especially regarding the efficient and targeted administration of TP53TG1-based therapeutics. Advanced RNA delivery technologies, including lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), sphingomyelin-based nanosystems, and polymer-based nanocarriers, have demonstrated the capacity to surmount these obstacles. This review aims to clarify the expression pattern of TP53TG1 in 10 malignant tumors, its biological relevance, its potential as a therapeutic target, and its importance in clinical applications, thereby offering a novel perspective on molecular targeting in cancer.

 International efforts focused on discovery of biological targets in inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) have suggested that aberrant inter-cellular relationship instead of genomic aberrations is the key driver of IBC. To identify such IBC-specific aberrations, we generated single nucleus chromatin accessibility and transcriptome atlas of IBCs (9,628 nuclei from three donors) and compared IBC atlas with a similar atlas of the healthy breast (81,735 nuclei from 92 donors). We recently reported single nucleus atlas of breast tissues of healthy women of diverse genetic ancestry (Nature Medicine in press). In that report, we described markers that identify three major epithelial cell subtypes [Basal-myoepithelial (BM), luminal adaptive secretory precursor (LASP), luminal hormone sensing (LHS)], two endothelial cell subtypes, two adipocyte subtypes, fibroblasts, macrophages, and T cells of the healthy breast. We also showed that LHS cells are the likely cells-of-origin of Luminal A, Luminal B and HER2+ breast cancers. Unlike these breast cancer subtypes, IBC does not appear to have a cell-of-origin, as epithelial cells in IBCs shared gene expression pattern across BM, LASP and LHS cells. Similar results were obtained when comparison was restricted to ancestry-specific healthy breast atlas. However, individual gene level expression differences affecting specific signaling pathways were observed in epithelial cells of IBCs. LASP, and LHS cells of IBCs overexpressed GPR137C, a positive regulator of mTORC1 signaling, and HS6ST3, an enzyme required for heparan sulfate synthesis. LASP and LHS cells of IBCs displayed activation of mitotic and matrix metalloproteinase signaling, respectively. Endothelial cells of IBCs, which showed significant gene expression differences compared to endothelial cells of the healthy breast, displayed enhanced integrin cell surface interaction but loss of cell junction organization. Most critically, BM, LASP, LHS, and endothelial cells of IBCs compared to their counterparts in the healthy breast showed downregulation of TEX14, an inter-cellular bridge forming factor in germ cells and a regulator of mitosis. Downregulation of TEX14 expression in these cells was accompanied with changes in the chromatin accessibility patterns of this gene. These results reinforce the notion that defective inter-cellular communication is a hallmark of IBC and TEX14 expression levels may serve as a biomarker of this defect. We suggest that greater attention to vascular biology and vascular-epithelial cell communication has to be given for better understanding of IBC biology and therapeutic targeting.

 Background:
 HRD is linked to sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors across various tumor types. However, the presence of HRD, driver events (such as pathogenic mutations in HR genes or other genomic alterations), and its clinical relevance in mCRC remain underexplored.
 Methods:
 We performed the VHIO-300 test, an ISO15189 accredited custom NGS panel profiling over 450 genes (including HR-related genes:
 ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2 or PALB2
 ) on 356 Stage IV mCRC patients (corresponding to 247 primary colorectal and 109 to metastatic samples) enrolled in the Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology’s Molecular Prescreening Program from June 2021 to December 2024. All samples had a tumor cellularity > 40% as per pathologist evaluation
 .
 An HR score (sHR) based on genome-wide copy number alterations (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) patterns is generated. After cross-validation with Myriad MyChoice, sHR ≥ 56 was established based on a cohort of ovarian tumors and used to identify HRD in mCRC tumor samples.
 Results:
 HRD prevalence was 3.4% in our mCRC cohort (12/356), but, much higher in metastatic lesions, (6.4%, 7/109) than in primary samples (2.03%, 5/247) (p = 0.05). In fact, the median sHR between primary (21) vs. metastases (30) in CRC was significantly different (p < 0.01). Regarding HR gene status, HR-mutated samples were not significantly within the HRD group (p = 0.27) and only 6.5% (2/31) were HRD. Noteworthy,
 BRCA2
 exhibits a frameshift deletion in a homopolymer stretch, that is a frequent hotspot in microsatellite instable (MSI) tumors, but this event was not found to be associated with HRD. In fact, all HRD tumors (n = 12) were microsatellite stable (MSS). Other frequent alterations in mCRC were studied and
 BRAF
 mutations were found to be present in 42% of HRD tumors (p < 0.01). Inversely, HRD was rare in
 KRAS
 -mutated samples (0.7%; 1/140) and, in fact, highly correlated with non-HRD status (p = 0.02), especially the G12 mutation (p < 0.01). Interestingly, CNA profiles also revealed a strong association between the
 BCL2L1
 loci gain and HRD (p < 0.01). Clinically, HRD was not significantly associated with prognostic value nor clinical benefit to oxaliplatin-based combinations. However, the limited sample size and heterogeneous treatment lines restricted robust statistical analysis.
 Conclusions:
 This study identified a small, yet significant subset of mCRC that displays HRD. sHR and HRD rates were higher in metastatic lesions vs primary tumors, indicating HR scarring could be accumulating over time in some mCRC patients. No clear association between pathogenic HR gene mutations and HRD were found, suggesting the involvement of alternative molecular mechanisms in this process. Frequent co-occurring events, such as
 BRAF
 mutations or
 BCL2L1
 gains could be drivers in CRC HRD, and shape, eventually, new therapeutic options for these patients in the metastatic setting.

        <tr id="Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) is the most frequently mutated member of the RAS family of small GTPases (RAS). It affects about one-fifth of cancer cases. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a multifaceted network of immune cells, metabolites, microbiota, stromal components, and extracellular matrix. It creates a dynamic ecosystem that supports malignant initiation, progression, and therapy resistance through bidirectional crosstalk with tumor cells. Emerging evidence reveals distinct TME landscapes shaped by wild-type versus oncogenic KRAS variants. Additionally, TME rewiring occurs during KRAS-targeted therapies. Deciphering these KRAS-dependent TME architectures and their therapeutic vulnerabilities represents a critical frontier for precision oncology. This review synthesizes key milestones and persistent challenges in KRAS inhibitor development. And it systematically evaluates how KRAS mutations orchestrated immunosuppressive niches, metabolic symbiosis, stromal remodeling, and microbiome dysbiosis, supported by mechanistic insights from preclinical and clinical studies. It further explores therapeutic opportunities arising from targeting TME interactions, including rational combinations of KRAS inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade, metabolic agents, or microbiota-modulating strategies.">

Oncogene amplifications promote genomic instability, which is integral to cancer cell survival and evolution. However, focal gene amplification potentially affords an opportunity for therapeutic exploitation. As a proof-of-concept, we leverage CRISPR-Cas9 nickase to selectively promote cancer cell death in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma in a gene amplification-dependent manner. Our analysis demonstrates that CRISPR-Cas9 nickase can generate a lethal number of highly toxic, replication-dependent double-strand breaks in cells harboring amplified loci. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cas9 nickase—mediated toxicity can be modulated in combination with small molecule inhibitors targeting key regulators of the DNA-damage response or cell death pathways. Importantly, our findings in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma translate to other cancer types with distinct oncogene amplifications.">

Decoding the dynamic signaling pathways underlying oncogenic metabolic reprogramming remains a major analytical challenge. Here, we report a cascaded DNA logic gate strategy capable of profiling the miR-210/CYGB/p53 axis that regulates the Warburg effect in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. By logically integrating an H2O2-responsive DNAzyme (Dz) module with an entropy-driven reaction (EDR), the INHIBIT-AND logic device simultaneously interrogates upstream (miR-210) and downstream (CYGB mRNA, H2O2) effectors, producing dual amplified fluorescent outputs in response to specific pathway states. This programmable system enables live-cell, logic-based decoding of the Warburg effect, distinguishing TNBC from other breast cancer subtypes and dynamically reflecting pathway modulation. Our approach establishes a generalizable framework for using molecular computation to analyze complex biological circuits, providing a powerful tool for precision pathway profiling and therapeutic strategy development.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are known to be involved in the manifestation of aggressive and therapy-resistant phenotypes in solid tumors. Nevertheless, the effects of dynamic intervention by TAMs on the DNA damage response of cancer cells are largely unexplored. Herein, we report that TAMs modulate the DNA damage repair pathways of ovarian cancer cells in response to platinum-(Pt) based therapeutic regimen. We demonstrate that coculture of TAMs with cancer cells directly upregulate Pol η, along with RAD18 and REV1 of the Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) pathway, while concurrently downregulating components of the high-fidelity nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanism. Consequently, we observed a better survival probability, DNA repair capacity, and enrichment of stemness properties in ovarian cancer cells. DNA bulky adducts produced by cisplatin are resolved through differential activation NER and TLS pathways. However, we elucidated that TAMs provide favorable conditions for activating the error-prone TLS pathway for lesion bypass over damage resolution. Furthermore, cellular crosstalk in cocultured cancer cells stimulates the nuclear translocation and expression of RelA, which recruits Pol η by acting as a potent transcription factor. In fact, with pristimerin-mediated disruption of p65 (RelA) translocation, the cancer cells become more prone to DNA damage-induced cell death and compromised regenerative potential. In both in vitro cell cultures and in vivo mouse xenograft models, cocultured macrophages exhibited predominantly M2-like phenotype with prevalence in the invasive zone of xenograft tumor margins. Taken together, our investigation revealed multifaceted crosstalk-mediated regulation of DNA damage repair between TAMs and ovarian cancer cells.

        <tr id="Heritable gene activity variations that do not alter the underlying DNA sequence are known as epigenetic modifications. Mutations that disrupt genome structure and function are key drivers of oncogenesis. In addition to genetic mutations that cause direct disruptions in the DNA sequence, epigenetic changes can affect gene expression, which helps the development of cancerous traits. Changes in DNA methylation and histone mark patterns are the main drivers of these epigenetic modifications, as they encourage the growth and spread of tumors. In this review, we explore the substantial implications of epigenetic control on tumor genesis, metastatic behaviour, metabolic pathways, and the tumor microenvironment, delving into the intricacies of this intricate regulation. We pay special attention to the dysregulation at every stage of epigenetic modulation, which includes, but is not limited to, abnormalities in the enzymes that modify histones and methylate DNA, subunit loss or fusions in chromatin remodeling complexes, and disruptions in higher-order chromatin structure. We also highlight the development of inhibitors of medications targeted at epigenetic enzymes and summarize the abnormal roles of enzymes in DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and histone methylation during tumour progression.">

DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs profoundly influence DNA repair mechanisms and genomic stability. Aberrant epigenetic patterns in cancer compromise DNA damage recognition and repair, therefore impairing homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and base excision repair (BER) by suppressing key repair genes and lowering access to repair sites. Then it is dissected how loss-of-function mutations in Switch/Sucrose non-fermentable, imitation switch and CHD (Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding) chromatin-remodeling complexes impair nucleosome repositioning, preventing effective damage sensing and assembly of repair machinery. Non-coding RNAs contribute to epigenetic silencing at DNA break sites, exacerbating repair deficiencies. This review evaluates recent advances concerning epigenetic dysfunction and DNA repair impairment. It is also highlighted that nanoparticle-mediated delivery strategies are designed to overcome pharmacologic resistance.

        <tr id="The discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes provided important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of cancer but also revealed some contradictions in the prevailing somatic mutation theory. The evidence that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) form an elaborate network that regulates the flow of genetic information in eukaryotic cells offers an explanation for the inconsistencies. ncRNAs comprise a wide variety of molecules that interact with one another as well as with other RNAs, DNA, and proteins, over whose activities they exert a regulatory influence. The outcome of the dynamic interactions of the cell’s biomolecules is the emergence of higher-order states of equilibrium, called attractor states, which correspond to the gene-expression configurations of distinct cell types. Attractor states are relatively stable systems, but they are susceptible to perturbation by a disturbing force, such as mutation. Mutations that disrupt the ncRNA network can enable the cell to undergo a state transition towards a potentially neoplastic one. This is the crux of tumorigenesis. An inquiry into the architecture of the ncRNA network and its role in tumorigenesis is required to complement our knowledge of the well-known cancer genes as well as serve as a guide in the design of new anticancer therapeutics.">

Despite advances in conventional therapies, issues such as drug resistance, systemic toxicity, and relapse continue to hinder long‐term survival rates. One underexplored molecular mechanism potentially contributing to cancer progression is the enzyme Human tRNA‐dihydrouridine synthase 2 (hDus2). hDus2 plays a pivotal role in tRNA modification by converting uridine residues to dihydrouridine, enhancing tRNA structural flexibility and translational efficiency. Elevated dihydrouridine levels in tRNA have been correlated with cancer progression, highlighting hDus2 as a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we investigated the inhibition of hDus2 as a novel strategy for cancer therapy. Using in silico techniques, we screened a library of FDA‐approved drugs against the 3D structure of hDus2. Top candidate compounds identified through virtual screening with the Glide module were further evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations. Parameters such as RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, and PCA were analyzed. Additionally, binding free energy calculations were performed to validate the stability and interaction strength of the hDus2 ligand complexes. Our results identified DB09050, a cephalosporin antibiotic used for treating complicated intra‐abdominal infections, and DB00650, a folate analog, as promising hDus2 inhibitors. These findings pave the way for further development of anticancer therapeutics post‐experimental validation.">

        <tr id="Background Targeted sequencing is critical in cancer diagnosis, treatment selection, and monitoring. However, the effectiveness of these methods for reflecting whole-exome sequencing (WES)-level mutational signatures remains unclear. Therefore, we addressed this issue through simulation-based analysis to clarify how well targeted sequencing can reproduce WES-level mutational signatures. Methods We compared the correlation and similarity of mutational signatures between whole-exome sequencing-level mutation data and downsampled data for gene sets targeted by each sequencing method in 13 cancer types. Additionally, a similarity analysis of the mutational signatures was conducted using randomly downsampled data. Results The comparison between whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing showed a low correlation based on Pearson’s correlation coefficient but a high similarity based on the Dice similarity index. As a result of the downsampling of data with cancer-related genes and whole genes to evaluate similarity, the cancer-related gene random set showed high similarity when 200–400 genes were selected. However, the whole-genome random set required 2–3 times as many genes as the cancer-related gene random set to show high similarity. Among cancer types, colorectal and lung cancers demonstrated high similarity with fewer downsampled genes, whereas breast and prostate cancers required more downsampled genes to achieve high similarity. Conclusion This study demonstrated that current clinically used targeted sequencing methods can reflect whole-exome sequencing-level mutational signatures. This suggests that considering the cancer type and average number of gene mutations in each patient when selecting targeted sequencing methods can lead to more effective treatment choices.">

        <tr id="Background Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a rare and aggressive pediatric bone malignancy with poor prognosis, driven by therapy-resistant tumor microenvironments (TME). The TME plays a critical role in tumor progression through a complex and dynamic network of reciprocal interactions among immune cells (dysfunctional T cells, immunosuppressive macrophages), stromal components (cancer-associated fibroblasts), and tumor cells. These interactions collectively shape the immune landscape, promote immune evasion, and contribute to therapeutic resistance. Identifying reliable prognostic markers remains a critical challenge. Methods Here we performed an integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, WGCNA, and bulk RNA-seq analyses to investigate tumor-immune interactions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) intersected with T cell markers identified a total of 174 T cell-associated genes. Functional enrichment analysis and molecular subtyping were performed to explore immune-related pathways. A prognostic model based on CLEC11A, BDP1, and ID3 was constructed using Cox regression and validated in external datasets. Immune infiltration was assessed using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Results T cell marker analyses revealed key roles in pathways such as PI3K-Akt signaling and immune modulation. Molecular subtyping identified two clusters with distinct immune microenvironments: Cluster C1 (immunosuppressive phenotype and poorer prognosis) and Cluster C2 (functionally active immune profile associated with better prognosis). The prognostic model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival (AUC: 0.85, 0.82, 0.78). Additionally, a higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) with low survival rate has been observed in High-risk group. Immune infiltration analysis showed higher CD8+ T cell and dendritic cell activity and immune checkpoint expression in low-risk groups. Experimental validation demonstrated that ID3 silencing inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in ES cell lines. Conclusion Together, our study identified CLEC11A, BDP1, and ID3 as key T cell associated prognostic markers and developed a validated model to predict survival outcomes in ES. Insights into T cell markers and tumor-immune dynamics offer promising advances in prognostic assessment and immunotherapy for ES. Furthermore, the role of ID3 in immune evasion and tumor proliferation underscores its potential as a therapeutic target, providing new avenues for immune checkpoint regulation and personalized treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy characterized by complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment, where mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contribute significantly to disease progression, immune suppression, and drug resistance. Methods This study investigated the heterogeneity of MSCs in multiple myeloma using single-cell RNA sequencing (10X) and bulk transcriptomic data. Further analysis was performed by Seurat, SCENIC, CellChat. GSE4581 and GSE136337 were used as training set and validation set to construct a newly described prognostic model through COX and LASSO. Results By analyzing bone marrow samples from healthy donors and multiple myeloma patients at different Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) stages, this study identified distinct MSC subpopulations, including osteogenic, angiogenic, immune regulatory, and multipotent clusters, each of which plays unique roles in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found a unique subclone with upregulated expression of high mobility group proteins, these MSC exert a strong regulatory effect, which was defined as “HMGhMSC”. Conclusions Our findings reveal that the proportion of osteogenic MSCs, which are crucial for bone health, decreases as the disease progresses, which is correlated with the bone lysis commonly observed in advanced multiple myeloma. Additionally, immune regulatory MSCs contribute to the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, promoting tumor immune evasion. A prognostic model based on HMGhMSC subpopulations was developed, which demonstrated that these cells have significant potential as therapeutic targets for improving the prognosis and developing treatments for bone disease in multiple myeloma patients.

        <tr id="Abstract Beta-hemoglobinopathies are severe genetic diseases caused by mutations affecting the production of the adult β-globin chain. The clinical severity is mitigated by the co-inheritance of mutations that reactivate the production of the fetal β-like γ-globin in adults. However, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the adult-to-fetal hemoglobin (HbA-to-HbF) switching are still not fully understood. Here, we used epigenome editing technologies to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying γ- and β-globin gene regulation and to develop novel potential therapeutics for β-hemoglobinopathies. Targeted removal of DNA methylation by dCas9-Tet1 (alone or together with the deposition of histone acetylation by CBP-dCas9) at the fetal promoters led to efficient and durable γ-globin reactivation, demonstrating that DNA methylation is a driver for HbF repression. This strategy, characterized by high specificity and a good safety profile, led to a substantial correction of the pathological phenotype in erythroid cells from patients with sickle cell disease.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly malignant digestive system cancer that is difficult to diagnose early and is highly resistant to conventional treatments. Recent studies on epigenetics have provided new insights into the early diagnosis of PC and treatments including immunotherapy. Epigenetic changes can alter gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, involving mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and the abnormal expression of noncoding RNAs. These mechanisms play crucial roles in the occurrence, development, and therapeutic response of tumors. This review summarizes progress in epigenetic research on PC and discusses the epigenetic characteristics, underlying mechanisms, early diagnosis, prognostic evaluation, treatment strategies, and future challenges for PC. Strategies targeting epigenetic changes may restore the expression of tumor suppressor genes and regulate the immune microenvironment and may be combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors as a new approach for the precise treatment of PC. However, there are challenges associated with the clinical application of epigenetic therapy, such as the development of resistance and adverse side effects, and challenges in target selection, so new epigenetic drugs and combination treatment strategies are needed. With the development of precision medicine, the integration of epigenetics and clinical medicine research has yielded broadly applicable findings. Interdisciplinary cooperation and advancements in clinical trials will further promote the application of epigenetics in PC research, providing more effective treatment options for patients. In the future, the combined application of epigenetic therapy and immunotherapy, the design of personalized treatment plans, and the development of technologies such as liquid biopsy will likely change the treatment landscape of PC.">

        <tr id="Background Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo Serine synthesis pathway (SSP), a highly regulated pathway overexpressed in several tumors. Specifically, PHGDH expression is dynamically regulated during different stages of tumor progression, promoting cancer aggressiveness. Previously, we demonstrated that high Serine (Ser) availability, obtained by increased exogenous uptake or increased PHGDH expression, supports 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC). Beyond its metabolic role in sustaining Ser biosynthesis, different “non-enzymatic roles” for PHGDH have recently been identified. The present study aims to investigate non-enzymatic mechanisms through which PHGDH regulates 5-FU response in CRC. Methods Overexpression and gene silencing approaches have been used to modulate PHGDH expression in human CRC cell lines to investigate the role of this enzyme in 5-FU cellular response. Identified mechanisms have been validated in selected 5-FU resistant cell lines, CRC patients-derived tumor tissue samples, and patients-derived 3D organoids. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on wild-type and PHGDH-silenced cell lines, allowing the identification of pathways responsible for PHGDH-mediated 5-FU resistance. The relevance of identified genes was validated in vitro and in vivo in a CRC xenograft model. Results PHGDH expression is highly variable among CRC tissues and patient-derived 3D organoids. A retrospective analysis of CRC patients highlighted a correlation between PHGDH expression and therapy response. Coherently, the modulation of PHGDH expression by gene silencing/overexpression affects 5-FU sensitivity in CRC cell lines. Transcriptomic analysis on CRC cell lines stably silenced for PHGDH evidenced down regulation in Hedgehog (HH) pathway. Accordingly, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the combined treatment of 5-FU and HH pathway inhibitors strongly hinders CRC cell survival and tumor growth in CRC xenograft models. Conclusions PHGDH sustains 5-FU resistance in CRC by mediating the upregulation of the HH signaling; targeting the here identified PHGDH-HH axis increases 5-FU susceptibility in different CRC models suggesting the 5-FU/HH-inhibitors combinatorial therapeutic strategy as a valid approach to counteract drug resistance in CRC.

 The Mismatch Repair (MMR) pathway, a crucial tumor suppressor mechanism, is dysregulated across cancer types. We previously identified the loss of the MutL complex of the MMR pathway, as a key factor inducing resistance to endocrine therapy in Estrogen Receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients. Preliminary data previously generated in the lab supports a role for MutL loss in promoting metastasis of ER+ breast cancer. A mammary-specific knockout mouse model for MLH1, a principal component of MutL, created in the Haricharan lab develops aggressive mammary tumors that metastasize to multiple organs. To unveil the mechanism by which MLH1 loss triggers metastasis, an unbiased RPPA and RNA-Seq was conducted which revealed cytokine secretion in the immune system as a distinctive signature of MLH1- ER+ breast cancer cells. The tumor secretome, particularly cytokines, can manipulate macrophage plasticity to skew polarization states towards either an anti- or pro- metastatic phenotype. Secreted cytokine levels altered by MLH1 loss were identified in multiple ER+ breast cancer cells lines from concentrated conditioned media. Additionally, in vivo experiments with xenograft MLH1- ER+ tumors in nude mice, revealed an elevated number of CD206 expressing tumor-promoting M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, MLH1- ER+ breast cancer cells grown in the presence of macrophages exhibit an increase in their migratory capacity. Our preliminary data strongly indicate that loss of MLH1 alters the ER+ breast cancer secretome and alters macrophage maturation, suggesting a role for MLH1 in immunomodulation supporting metastatic progression. Investigation of this new role will uncover key tumor-intrinsic drivers of “cold” tumor immune microenvironment profiles and present unique opportunities for therapeutic interventions to convert them into “hot” profiles, thereby improving ER+ breast cancer patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Mutation spectra vary across genetic and environmental contexts, leading to differences between and within species. Most research on mutation spectrum has focused on the trinucleotide (3-mer) mutation types in mammals, limiting the breadth and depth of variation surveyed. In this study, we use whole-genome resequencing data across 108 eukaryotic species – including mammals, fish, plants, and invertebrates – to characterize pentanucleotide (5-mer) non-coding mutation spectra using a Bayesian approach. Our findings reveal cytosine transition mutability at CpG and (among plants) at CHG sites as the main drivers of variation in mutation spectra across eukaryotes, correlating strongly with genomic CpG and CHG depletion. However, despite the influence of methylation on CpG mutability, genome-wide average CpG methylation levels do not predict CpG transition rates across species and CHG methylation does not predict CHG transition rate, indicating unknown genetic or environmental factors influencing mutation rates at methylated cytosines. Together, our results illustrate the pivotal role of mutagenesis in shaping genome composition across eukaryotes and highlight a gap in knowledge about the mechanisms governing mutation rates.">

        <tr id="Objective. This study describes mutations of genes that stimulate and regulate cell growth, programmed cell death, DNA repair, and cell growth suppression in a boy with osteosarcoma. 
Case Report. We report a case of bone sarcoma in a 9-year-old boy with possible familial predisposition. In our patient, only a subset of tumor cells expressed the ATRX protein, which is known to control the expression of several genome regions. The function of the p53 protein, which acts as a transcription factor that regulates the DNA damage repair response, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis pathways, is lost in 40-50% of malignant cells. Retinoblastoma was positive in the predominant subset of tumor cells. Deletion is found on chromosome 9, cytoband 9p21.3, where the genes for CDKN2A and CDKN2B are located. Neoplastic cells were SATB2-positive in a substantial subset, with nu- clear staining. The SATB2 protein is a DNA-binding protein involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. Chromosomal losses of 8p and 19q11-q13.43 were also found. These regions contain several tumor suppressor genes, including NKX3.1, whose reduced expression correlates with 8p loss in high-grade tumors. Although there was no known cancer syn- drome in the family, the maternal grandfather had a similar tumor requiring amputation. 
Conclusion. Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of osteosarcoma and is characterized by heterogeneous and extensive genetic complexity. Various numerical and structural genomic rearrangements have been described in cancer cells. However, there is little consistent genetic change to understand the etiopathogenesis of this aggressive tumor.">

        <tr id="Aggressive and therapy-resistant glioblastoma is among the most lethal malignant tumors in humans. Complete surgical resection is often unachievable; therefore, combination chemoradiotherapy is used to target tumor cells residual beyond the resection margin. This approach induces DNA damage in tumor cells and activates the apoptosis pathway. Unfortunately, recurrence remains a major clinical challenge, frequently manifesting as more aggressive and treatmentresistant glioblastoma phenotypes. The DNA repair and damage response (DDR) pathways are critical for maintaining genome stability. While defects in these mechanisms contribute to oncogenesis, they also make tumor cells vulnerable to DNA-damaging therapy, as the cells become dependent on residual repair capacity. It is of paramount importance to understand the molecular components of these mechanisms and to identify potential therapeutic/pharmacological targets for improving outcomes in glioblastoma patients. A subpopulation of stem-like cells, designated as glioblastoma cancer stem cells (CSCs), has been identified as a critical factor in the initiation, maintenance, and recurrence of tumors. These cells exhibit therapy resistance due to enhanced DNA repair capacity. In addition, emerging evidence suggests a link between carbohydrate metabolism and DNA repair pathways, thereby revealing novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in glioblastoma. This review examines current strategies targeting DNA repair mechanisms in glioblastoma. We present a synopsis of recent advancements in research concerning the mechanisms and factors involved in the elimination of DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation and temozolomide (TMZ). Furthermore, we explore the potential of DNA repair pathway inhibitors under investigation in preclinical and clinical trials.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are functionally diverse stromal regulators that orchestrate tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance through dynamic crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent advances in single‐cell multiomics and spatial transcriptomics have identified conserved CAF subtypes with distinct molecular signatures, spatial distributions, and context‐dependent roles, highlighting their dual capacity to promote immunosuppression or restrain tumor growth. However, therapeutic strategies struggle to reconcile this functional duality, hindering clinical translation. This review systematically categorizes CAF subtypes by origin, biomarkers, and TME‐specific functions, focusing on their roles in chemoresistance, maintenance of stemness, and formation of immunosuppressive niches. We evaluate emerging targeting approaches, including selective depletion of tumor‐promoting subsets (e.g., fibroblast activation protein+ CAFs), epigenetic reprogramming toward antitumor phenotypes, and inhibition of CXCL12/CXCR4 or transforming growth factor‐beta signaling pathways. Spatial multiomics‐driven combinatorial therapies, such as the synergistic use of CAFs and immune checkpoint inhibitors, are highlighted as strategies to overcome microenvironment‐driven resistance. By integrating CAF biology with translational advances, this work provides a roadmap for developing subtype‐specific biomarkers and precision stromal therapies, directly informing efforts to disrupt tumor‐stroma coevolution. Key concepts include spatial transcriptomics, stromal reprogramming, and tumor‐stroma coevolution, offering actionable insights for both mechanistic research and clinical innovation.">

        <tr id="Genotoxic stress-induced stem cell maldifferentiation (GSMD) integrates DNA damage responses with loss of stemness and lineage-specific differentiation to prevent damaged stem cell propagation. However, molecular mechanisms governing GSMD remain unclear. Here, we identify the p53-induced long non-coding RNA LOC644656 as a key regulator of GSMD in human embryonic stem cells. LOC644656 accumulates in the nucleus upon DNA damage, disrupting pluripotency by interacting directly with POU5F1 and KDM1A/LSD1-NuRD complexes, repressing stemness genes, and activating TGF-β signaling. Additionally, LOC644656 mitigates DNA damage by binding DNA-PKcs and modulating the DNA damage response. In cancer, elevated LOC644656 correlates with poor patient survival and enhanced chemoresistance. Our findings demonstrate that LOC644656 mediates stemness suppression and resistance to genotoxic stress by coordinating DNA damage signaling and differentiation pathways. Thus, LOC644656 represents a potential therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance and advancing stem cell biology.">

        <tr id="Pathogenic variants of the RB1 gene have commonly been found in many cancer types, including retinoblastoma. Nonsense mutations are the most common mutation type in retinoblastoma; however, few cell lines mimic nonsense mutations in the RB1 gene that are commonly observed in patients. Here, we established retinoblastoma-like cell lines carrying mono- and bi-allelic nonsense mutations in the RB1 gene. We introduced the R552X mutation using target activation-induced cytidine deaminase base editing and successfully constructed cell lines carrying mono- and bi-allelic mutations. The model cell lines showed decreased RB1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, and increased cell proliferation. Furthermore, we rescued the nonsense mutation in the RB1 gene in model cell lines by converting stop codon 552 to tryptophan using an adenine base editor. This approach may be applicable for establishing cell lines with pathogenic variants found in patients and suggests a strong potential for the application of gene editing as a therapeutic strategy.

        <tr id="Over the past half-century of the global effort against cancer, the vast majority of investigations in both tumor basic research and clinical practice have centered on the "somatic mutation" theory, such as in molecular classification, individualized precision medicine strategies, gene therapy approaches, the development of neoantigen-based tumor vaccines, and advancements in sequencing technologies. Even in the extensively studied tumor microenvironment (including tumor immunity), which has garnered significant attention in recent years, the underlying mechanisms frequently revert to specific genes and mutations within tumor cells or microenvironmental cells as the primary driving forces. However, despite the dominance of the "somatic mutation" paradigm, truly effective approaches for curing cancer in clinical settings remain elusive. Undoubtedly, if the prevailing "somatic mutation theory" continues to monopolize cancer research, meaningful progress in understanding and treating cancer will likely remain frustratingly out of reach. At this critical juncture in the evolution of cancer research, a comprehensive re-evaluation of cancer not only is necessary but also imperative, highlighting the urgent need for a profound transformation in our conceptual framework. This article systematically elucidates the novel perspective offered by the "tumor system" for comprehending the essence of cancer, the foundational principles of "tumor ecology" and their potential applications in treatment, and explores in depth the theoretical framework and research significance of the emerging field of "ecological pathology". Beyond merely advocating for the abandonment of the currently dominant linear reductionist paradigm of cancer, this commentary strives to construct a pragmatic and systematically structured framework to guide the trajectory of the "post-genomic revolution in oncology" and the "tumor ecological philosophy", ultimately fostering the realization of the overarching societal goal of eradicating cancer.">

        <tr id="Mutations in TP53 are mutually exclusive with other known drivers of myeloid transformation and define a distinct molecular subtype within de novo Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) that is associated with a complex karyotype, resistance to chemotherapy, and poor prognosis. Although TP53 defects are rare in de novo AML, biallelic mutations are a defining molecular feature of erythroleukemia. The genetic alterations that cooperate with defective TP53 to transform erythroid progenitors remain unknown. We found that loss of BAP1 (BRCA1 Associated Protein-1) co-occurs in one-third of patients with TP53-mutated AML, is associated with an erythroid-primed gene expression signature, and confers an additional adverse effect on overall survival. BAP1 is a tumor suppressor involved in the DNA damage response as well as epigenetic regulation through histone H2AK119 de-ubiquitination. While Bap1KO mice develop myelodysplasia with prominent dyserythropoiesis, combined deletion of Bap1 and Trp53 caused transplantable erythroleukemia, and occasionally mixed AML, mirroring the heterogeneity of human disease. Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq coupled to ChIP-seq in hematopoietic progenitors revealed that Bap1 loss triggers a proinflammatory response and cooperates with Trp53 deficiency to transform erythroid-primed multipotent progenitors. Mechanistically, genomic instability led to the development of erythroleukemia, while epigenetic deregulation caused myelomonocytic skewing suggesting a dichotomous and context dependent role for BAP1. We also demonstrate that BAP1 deficient erythroleukemia is dependent on BCL2L1 expression and is sensitive to BCL-xL inhibitors in vivo.">

Recent advances in CRISPR–Cas9–based genome editing have revolutionized cancer
immunotherapy by enabling precise and efficient T-cell engineering. This review focuses on how
CRISPR-mediated modifications enhance T-cell functionality, highlighting key applications, such
as CAR-T cells and TCR-engineered T-cell therapies. By selectively targeting immune-regulating
genes, CRISPR empowers T cells to recognize and eliminate tumor cells with greater specificity
and reduce off-target effects. This precision opens the door to personalized treatment strategies, allowing
T cells to be tailored to each patient’s unique tumor profile. Furthermore, the ability to
rapidly and systematically edit multiple gene targets has accelerated the development of more potent
and durable T-cell therapies, overcoming some of the current limitations in cancer immunotherapy.
Overall, CRISPR’s transformative potential of CRISPR provides a platform for next-
generation patient-centric cancer treatments, paving the way for improved clinical outcomes and

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is characterized by high malignancy, and its global incidence is predicted to continue to increase over the past decades. However, the mechanisms underlying ICC pathogenesis and progression remain unclear.


APPROACH AND RESULTS
The training cohort consisted of single-cell sequencing of 12 treatment-naïve ICC samples and spatial transcriptomics of four ICC samples. The validation cohort comprised of RNA-seq data from 87 ICC tumor samples. Finally, we validated our findings via multiplex immunofluorescence, organoids, and mice models both in vivo and in vitro. We found significant heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of ICC patients. ICC cells were classified into five molecular subtypes, and we revealed that aspartate beta-hydroxylase (ASPH) was a marker gene for invasion subtypes. We then selected cepharanthine (CEP) as an ASPH inhibitor that effectively suppressed tumor progression. Regarding the ICC lymphatic metastasis mechanism, we found that tumor cells in N1 lymph nodes highly expressed tumor-specific MHC-II molecules but lacked co-stimulatory factors CD80/CD86, inducing a state of anergy in CD4+ T cells, which might facilitate ICC immune evasion.


CONCLUSIONS
The TME of ICC was heterogeneous. ASPH markedly enhanced ICC invasion The ASPH inhibitor CEP significantly inhibits ICC progression and may serve as a targeted therapeutic drug for ICC. Tumor cells in N1 lymph nodes demonstrate high expression of tumor-specific MHC-II molecules, but silencing of co-stimulatory factors such as CD80/CD86 induces CD4+ T cells into an anergic state. Our study indicated that ASPH and MHC-II may serve as novel therapeutic targets for ICC.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis that is driven primarily by oncogenic KRAS mutations present in > 90% of cases. KRAS mutations, particularly the G12D mutation which dominates in PDAC, fuel tumor initiation, progression, and immune evasion, thereby contributing to therapy resistance. Nevertheless, KRAS has long been considered "undruggable" due to its structure. Recent advances have spurred transformative progress in direct KRAS inhibition. While FDA-approved mutation-specific and pan-KRAS inhibitors show limited efficacy in PDAC, emerging agents (MRTX1133 and RMC-9805) have demonstrated preclinical promise. However, resistance remains a critical hurdle and is driven by pathway reactivation, secondary mutations, and metabolic adaptations. Alternative strategies targeting upstream regulators (SHP2 and SOS1) aim to block KRAS activation and associated resistance mechanisms. Preclinical studies have also highlighted synergistic benefits of combining KRAS inhibitors with MEK, PI3K, or CDK4/6 inhibitors, which are now undergoing clinical evaluation. Immunotherapies, including KRAS-targeted vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies, have further expanded the therapeutic landscape of enhancing KRAS-targeted therapies in PDAC. The molecular basis of KRAS-driven PDAC, current inhibitors, resistance mechanisms, and innovative strategies are discussed herein to address treatment barriers. Opportunities to improve clinical outcomes are underscored in this challenging malignancy by integrating insights from preclinical and clinical research.">

        <tr id="Abstract Transposable elements (TE), also called transposons, are repetitive DNA sequences making up half of the human genome. Initially, TEs were described as “junk DNA” because they lack specific function. However, they have been recognized for their ability to replicate and integrate into different genomic locations; this “jumping gene” activity results in genomic instability, variation of the chromosomal architecture, and transcriptional dysregulation, all of which represent major hallmarks of cancer. In this respect, the involvement of TE in tumorigenesis was extensively studied and their role as diagnostic and therapeutic tools in cancer is now well-established. Transposons’ products, including TE-derived cancer antigens, transcripts, and associated epigenetic modifications, mainly hypomethylation, were found to be promising biomarkers in several types of cancer ensuring early disease detection and prognosis. In addition, TE are currently used to design innovative approaches, with transposon-based systems, namely, Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac, enabling precise genomic modifications and novel strategies for cancer therapy. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide an overview on the dual application of TE as diagnostic and therapeutic tools in cancer, paving the way to improved clinical outcomes.

        <tr id="Background: DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion1 (DSCC1) is a component of the alternative replication factor C complex (RFC), which plays an important role in sister chromatid cohesion and regulates the cell cycle. DSCC1 is reported to have increased expression in tumor progression, but the underlying mechanisms of DSCC1 in tumor immunity remain obscure. Methods: Data were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to obtain DSCC1 expression and clinicopathologically relevant data. Differential expression of DSCC1 and its association with prognosis, tumor microenvironment, immune infiltration, immune regulation, and genomic stability in various cancers were analyzed using R software. Results: The results of pan-cancer analysis showed that DSCC1 expression was elevated in 22 tumors. In 15 tumors, high expression of DSCC1 was observed to correlate with dismal overall survival. Furthermore, a correlation between DSCC1 expression and immune checkpoints was determined. In addition, DSCC1 expression was correlated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells, especially in Thymoma (THYM). Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that DSCC1 is critically involved in tumor proliferation, immunity, and metabolism. Conclusions: High DSCC1 expression is found in many common tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. The gene is an essential factor in sister chromatid cohesion and may contribute to tumor progression by affecting the tumor immune microenvironment and genomic stability. DSCC1 has the potential to be a prognostic marker, and therapies targeting it may benefit patients.">

        <tr id="Background Gastric cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. The genetic factors contributing to gastric cancer progression and resistance to therapies, particularly radiotherapy, are not fully understood. TP53, ATM, RAD51, and BAX are genes involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and response to stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression patterns of these genes in gastric cancer, their potential role in radiotherapy resistance, and their diagnostic value. Methodology Gene expression levels of TP53, ATM, RAD51, and BAX were assessed using RT-qPCR across 9 gastric cancer cell lines and 6 normal control cell lines. Additionally, protein expression was confirmed via IHC and TCGA dataset analysis. Methylation levels of these genes were evaluated in gastric cancer tissues using the GSCA database. Mutational analysis was conducted using cBioPortal, and survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier and meta-analysis. The radiotherapy resistance study was carried out by knocking down TP53, RAD51, and BAX in AGS and MKN-45 gastric cancer cell lines, followed by expression analysis, colony formation, and wound healing assays. Results The expression of TP53, RAD51, and BAX was significantly upregulated, while ATM was downregulated in gastric cancer cell lines compared to normal controls. All four genes demonstrated good discriminatory power (AUC = 1) in distinguishing gastric cancer from normal samples. Methylation analysis revealed significant hypomethylation of TP53, RAD51, and BAX, and hypermethylation of ATM in gastric cancer tissues. Mutational analysis showed that TP53 was altered in 88% of gastric cancer samples, while ATM, RAD51, and BAX exhibited lower mutation rates. Survival analysis suggested that elevated expression of TP53, RAD51, and BAX may be linked to poorer survival outcomes, while reduced ATM expression appeared to associate with decreased overall survival. However, these associations require further validation through additional studies. Knockdown of TP53, RAD51, and BAX in AGS and MKN-45 cells resulted in significantly reduced cell proliferation and slower wound healing, highlighting their role in radiotherapy resistance. Conclusion The TP53, RAD51, and BAX genes are significantly involved in gastric cancer progression and resistance to radiotherapy. Their expression and mutation status provide valuable diagnostic and prognostic information.

Liquid biopsy offers a viable alternative to archival tumor tissue for genetic analysis. In this study, we assessed the feasibility and utility of combining mutational panel sequencing with shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) to refine HRR status determination from plasma in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. The mutational profile of 16 HRR genes was assessed in 63 PCa patients: 28.6% of patients harbored putative pathogenic variants in HRR-related genes. A HRR-mutant status was defined for 10 patients (15.8%). Through the integration of sWGS data, plasma samples non-informative about somatic alterations were identified, and germline/somatic origin of HRR mutations was defined. Matched tumor tissue was available for 41 patients, with an 85.7% concordance rate between plasma and tissue mutational analyses. Additionally, we explored the copy number variation (CNV) profile using sWGS and it was found concordant with the literature PCa profiles. Our findings demonstrated that ctDNA analysis through liquid biopsy is a reliable alternative to tissue-based methods for identifying SNVs and CNVs. However, concordance was affected by ctDNA levels in plasma and clonal hematopoiesis. The data highlight the utility of integrating sWGS with targeted mutation analysis for comprehensive molecular profiling of PCa patients.

        <tr id="Double‐strand breaks (DSBs) are universally acknowledged as the most detrimental type of DNA damage, and their effective repair primarily depends on the non‐homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Such DSBs, which require NHEJ for resolution, can arise from intrinsic and extrinsic DNA‐damaging factors or emerge naturally during essential biological processes like V(D)J recombination and antibody class switch recombination.Failure to properly repair DSBs may lead to genomic instability, disruption of cellular functions, and immunodeficiency, thereby promoting the development of hematologic malignancies. Conversely, overexpression of NHEJ‐related genes can enhance resistance to DNA‐damaging therapies in these cancers. Analyzing mutations in key classical NHEJ (cNHEJ) components and understanding their mechanisms could provide valuable biomarkers for predicting therapeutic outcomes and guiding treatment decisions. Consequently, defects in cNHEJ may offer insights into the development of novel drugs targeting DNA repair pathways.We focus on genetic changes and alterations in gene regulation, while also providing an overview of cNHEJ.">

 A deeper understanding of the complicated transcriptional landscape of human breast cancers are vital to identifying more efficacious treatments. Investigating genetic variations among breast cancer subtypes at a single-cell level holds the potential to enhance our understanding of cancer formation, progression, and elucidate actionable targets. In this study, we compile single-cell RNA sequencing data from patient tumors and matched lymph metastasis, reduction mammoplasties, breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs), and cell lines, forming a diverse dataset consisting of 117 samples with a total of 506,719 cells. These samples include hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes, along with isogenic model pairs. Within this study, we outline the similarities and differences across these models and patient samples, and assess therapeutic drug efficacy based on subtype proportions. Within the TNBC subtype, PDX models exhibited a closer resemblance to patient samples in terms of tumor heterogeneity and cell cycle features compared to cell lines. Acquired drug resistance in TNBC PDX tumors was linked to an increase in basal-like cell proportions, as defined by SCSubtype and TNBCtype cell typing predictors. Cell-wise subtyping revealed all patient samples comprised a mix of subtypes; notably, HR+ lymph node metastases had a lower proportion of HER2-Enriched cells compared to matched primary tumors. PDXOs displayed differences in metabolic-related transcripts relative to matched PDX tumors. Correlative analyses of cytotoxic drugs on PDX cells demonstrated that therapeutic efficacy was dependent on subtype proportions. Herein we provide an extensive multi-model dataset, a dynamic approach to cell-wise sample annotation, and a thorough examination of models within human breast cancer systems. This analysis and reference resource will support informed decision-making in preclinical research and therapeutic development by establishing model limitations, subtype-specific insights, and novel targetable pathways.

 How can we improve the safety and efficiency of germline gene correction using CRISPR/Cas9 in early mouse embryos?



 We observed a higher frequency of desirable gene editing events when using crRNA XT for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene correction during fertilization of mouse oocytes.



 CRISPR/Cas9 induces double-stranded DNA breaks, which can be repaired via homology-directed repair (HDR) using a repair template to achieve precise gene editing. Undesired events may occur, including non-homologous end joining, leading to error-prone repair causing insertions or deletions (indels), unrepaired DNA breaks resulting in large deletions or partial chromosomal loss, or HDR using the untargeted parental chromosome (gene conversion), causing loss of heterozygosity.
 HDR frequencies in early embryos are typically much lower compared to gene editing outcomes in somatic cell lines. In this study, we aimed to improve HDR efficiency by using chemically modified crRNA optimized for high nuclease environments.



 To achieve gene correction with reduced mosaicism, we co-injected CRISPR/Cas9 along with mutant C57BL/6J mouse sperm (carrying a homozygous Plcz1 deletion, causing failed fertilization after ICSI) into wild-type B6D2F1 and DBA/2 mouse oocytes for subsequent developmental and detailed genetic analysis, respectively.
 We analysed 59 embryos injected with crRNA XT and 60 embryos injected with classical crRNA. The repair template used contained synonymous variants, which, if detected, indicate successful gene correction through HDR with template use.



 We injected CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, designed for correcting the Plcz1 deletion, simultaneously with mutant mouse sperm into wild-type mouse oocytes during piezo-assisted ICSI, followed by artificial activation. We compared the use of crRNA XT, containing additional modifications for improved functional stability, to classical crRNA. After four days of in vitro culture, DNA was extracted and used for targeted sequencing, whole genome amplification, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis to evaluate the events following gene editing.



 After gene correction using classical crRNA, targeted sequencing revealed that the deletion was undetectable in 8 out of 60 embryos (13.3%). However, none of these embryos contained the synonymous variants which would indicate HDR with the provided repair template. In contrast, using crRNA XT, the deletion was no longer detected in 22 out of 59 embryos (37.3%). The synonymous variants were found in 50% of the embryos with undetectable deletions, suggesting a remarkable increase in HDR rates with the repair template. These results indicate that crRNA XT, with its enhanced stability, leads to a remarkable improvement in the frequency of desired gene editing events.
 To explain further the events in which the deletion is no longer detected without incorporation of the repair template’s synonymous variants, we performed whole-genome amplification and copy number variation (CNV) analysis using shallow whole-genome sequencing. In the embryos edited using classical crRNA, we observed partial chromosomal loss of chromosome 6 (carrying the Plcz1 gene) in 1 out of 7 analysed embryos and aneuploidy with partial chromosomal loss of chromosome 6 in 1 out of 7 analysed embryos. CNV analysis of embryos edited with crRNA XT is still ongoing to complete our comparison.



 The resolution of the shallow whole-genome sequencing is limited to 5 Mbp. To detect larger deletions smaller than this threshold, we will perform long-read sequencing.



 Targeted sequencing of embryos undergoing early gene correction for the Plcz1 deletion revealed that the use of crRNA XT, which offers greater stability, significantly enhanced the frequency of HDR with the repair template compared to classical crRNA. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of germline gene editing events.

        <tr id="Mutations and gene rearrangements are crucial for the diagnosis and subtyping of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the contribution of non-coding genetic variants, particularly those within cis-regulatory elements (CREs), to AML pathophysiology and heterogeneity remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterize the single-cell chromatin accessibility landscapes of 10 bone marrow samples from AML patients at diagnosis. Additionally, we develop eMut, an integrated computational pipeline for detecting, imputing, and functionally characterizing non-coding mutations in CREs at the single-cell level. Our analysis identifies 2878 potential somatic non-coding mutations, highlighting the extensive mutational heterogeneity in the non-coding genome of AML patients, with recurrent non-coding mutations displaying cell type-specific patterns. We show that mutated CREs are enriched with blood-related genetic variants, potentially linked to AML-associated genes, and harbor a higher abundance of functional CREs, suggesting their functional relevance in leukemogenesis. Importantly, we pinpoint candidate functional non-coding mutations that associate with alteration of target gene expression in AML. Collectively, our work provides a comprehensive resource of single-cell chromatin accessibility in AML and introduces an integrative approach to identify candidate functional non-coding mutations contributing to cellular heterogeneity in AML.">

        <tr id="The objective of this article is to promote abnormal methylation enzymes (MEs) as a critical cause of cancer and the destabilization of abnormal MEs as a new approach to direct cancer therapy. MEs are a ternary enzyme complex consisting methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT)-methylatransferase (MT)-S-adenostkhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) which plays a pivotal role on the regulation of cell grow and differentiation. Normal cell growth is under the allosteric regulation of MEs by steroid hormone. In telomerase expressing cells such as pluripotent stem cells, MEs become associated with telomerase that changes kinetic properties of MAT-SAHH isozyme pair by increasing Km values and the regulation greatly in favor of cell growth. Embryonic development of the fetus depends on abnormal MEs to regulate exceptional growth. Abnormal MEs do not cause problem to cells expressing telomerase, because the operation of abnormal MEs is strictly under the control of safety mechanisms such as contact inhibition, ten-eleven translocator-1 enzyme and chemo-surveillance. If safety mechanisms become dysfunctional, clinical symptoms will arise, cancer being the worst case. Wound healing requires the proliferation and the terminal differentiation of progenitor stem cells (PSCs) which are pluripotent embryonic stem cells.  Wound unhealing is mostly attributable to the collapse of chemo-surveillance. But the nature does not have a mechanism to correct the collapse of chemo-surveillance. Instead, PSCs are forced to evolve into cancer stem cells (CSCs) by the silencing of TET-1 enzyme to escape contact inhibition that limits the extent PSCs can proliferate. The proliferation of CSCs still cannot heal the wound, which are then forced to progress to faster growing CCs by chromosomal abnormalities to activate oncogenes or to inactivate suppressor genes, eventually forcing CSCs to become full blown CCs. CSCs became known in 1997. The discovery of CSCs unraveled CSCs as the most important issue of cancer, because these are the cells to initiate cancer growth, and the cells responsible to cause the fatality of cancer. Elimination of CSCs is essential to the success of cancer therapy. The evolution of CSCs is critically linked to wound unhealing. Therefore, induction of terminal differentiation of CSCs is the only option to solve the issue of CSCs. CSCs are unresponsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy, because these cells are protected by drug resistance, anti-apoptosis mechanisms and devoid of program death antigen. Besides, these therapies contribute to the destruction of chemo-surveillance. CDA formulations are the best drugs to eliminate CSCs, which are the nature’s creation for the perfection of wound healing to avoid and to cure cancer. CDA formulations can also eliminate CCs by turning CCs into terminally differentiated cells unable to replicate. Therefore, destabilization of abnormal MEs is the right indication to direct cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Background Glioblastoma is the most aggressive type of brain tumor and is associated with a poor prognosis. First-line treatment is surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide-based chemotherapy. However, the duration of treatment with temozolomide is limited due to both its toxicity and the development of drug resistance. The prognostic and predictive factor for response to temozolomide is the methylation status of the MGMT promoter. Indeed, loss of MGMT promoter methylation is a major cause of chemoresistance. However, the development of drug resistance is not only associated with changes in MGMT methylation. The entire epigenome changes and acquires specific properties necessary for tumor progression. Methods To study epigenetic alterations associated with temozolomide exposure, we generated a TMZ-resistant cell model. We investigated epigenetic alterations in the cell model and in a cohort of patients with recurrent glioblastoma using genome-wide methylome approaches (Epic Arrays 850 k). Results We investigated the epigenetic changes associated with temozolomide exposure. Therefore, we generated a TMZ-resistant cell model and studied the epigenetic features acquired after selective temozolomide pressure. Our next step was to investigate the epigenomic differences between primary and recurrent tumors in a small cohort of patients. Finally, we performed a cross-analysis between the epigenetic differences found in TMZ-resistant cells and recurrent glioblastomas to identify common signatures that could be used to guide future resistance-overcoming studies. Conclusions Temozolomide induces significant epigenetic changes in glioblastoma, which may contribute to treatment resistance and increased tumor aggressiveness. The results suggest that further research into DNA methylation changes associated with TMZ resistance is crucial. The use of primary tumor cells in resistance models may help identify strategies to overcome chemoresistance in glioblastoma.

        <tr id="The biological mechanisms underlying the cooperation between germline genetic variants and somatic mutations during carcinogenesis are rarely elucidated. Here, characterizing isogenic prostate cancer cell lines, we dissected the interplay between a germline variant at the 7p14.3 locus (rs1376350, G>A) and early recurrent prostate cancer-specific mutation in the Speckle-Type POZ protein (SPOP) gene across human prostate adenocarcinomas. The transcriptomes of multiple edited models pointed to Gli3 and the Hedgehog signaling pathway in a genotype-specific manner, while SPOP mutation and AR stimulation promote Gli3 accumulation in the full-length (FL) transcriptionally active form. This, in turn, triggers the cell-autonomous production of steroids that prostate cancer relies on, in line with the enhanced responsiveness of SPOP-mutated prostate cancer to androgen deprivation therapy. These data demonstrate that germline variants dictate men's prostate cancer somatic evolution and suggest opportunities to jointly model germline-somatic tandems to help untangle the complexity of human cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract Exacerbating the DNA replication problems of cancer cells serves as a viable therapeutic approach. Nevertheless, the cytotoxicity of cancer drugs is often hampered by therapy-induced senescence, leading to unfavorable patient outcomes. Here, we employ acute replisome dysfunction in combination with Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibition as a strategy to divert senescent cells toward death by triggering DNA replication catastrophe, a form of irreversible replication fork collapse caused by excessive single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) accumulation. RNA-sequencing revealed a distinct set of p53-responsive genes responsible for death. We identify c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to be essential for augmenting p53-dependent apoptotic programs and inducing pan-nuclear distribution of γH2AX, together constituting a feed-forward loop to drive cell death. Activation of DNA-PKcs initiates the signaling cascade of replication catastrophe, including CHK1-dependent JNK activation, which relies on MRE11 and PARP1 to expand and recognize ssDNA gaps, defining replication-associated gaps as an underlying basis for replication catastrophe. Our study elucidates the dynamic regulation of proximal and distal effectors along the DNA-PKcs/JNK/p53 axis that govern the cell fate decision between senescence and death. We propose that key determinants of replication catastrophe signaling are targetable vulnerabilities that can be exploited to limit senescent cell populations and increase the efficacy of anti-cancer therapies.">

        <tr id="Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by poor prognosis due to its resistance to chemotherapy, particularly in the advanced stages. This neoplasm originates from endometriotic cysts containing high levels of iron, derived from blood. This accumulation of iron generates oxidative stress, leading to DNA damage and carcinogenesis. Genomic analyses have identified frequent mutations in ARID1A and PIK3CA, which are also present in normal endometrial gland cells, suggesting that the cells originated from normal endometrium. A unique gene expression profile, termed the OCCC signature, is characterized by the upregulation of HNF1B signaling and oxidative stress-related genes. These genes are induced by the stressful microenvironment of endometriotic cysts. Comprehensive DNA methylation analysis has revealed that ovarian CCC exhibits a distinct epigenetic landscape, marked by global hypomethylation of HNF1B-related transcriptional signals, resulting in their activation. Functionally, ovarian CCC is characterized by enhanced anaerobic metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and resistance to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. Notably, the suppression of HNF1B has been associated with increased sensitivity to chemotherapy, highlighting its role in drug resistance. These findings suggest that ovarian CCC develops through epigenomic carcinogenesis, wherein chronic oxidative stress in endometriotic cysts drives epigenetic alterations that promote tumor formation and therapeutic resistance, representing “epigenetic dispositions”. The elucidation of these mechanisms may provide novel insights into potential therapeutic targets to overcome the aggressive behaviors of ovarian CCC.">

        <tr id="The ATP-hydrolytic ectoenzyme ENPP1 has been implicated in the metastasis and recurrence in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), primarily by contributing to tumor cell survival and treatment resistance. However, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. In a model of local recurrence (LR), circulating tumor cells (CTC) engrafting in the post-resection tumor bed developed a radioresistant phenotype linked to an ENPP1+-gene signature which was also identified in TNBC patients, suggesting ENPP1´s role in genome integrity. Blockade of ENPP1 using a permeable ENPP1 inhibitor (AVA-NP-695) reduced radioresistance, mechanistically attributed to decreased homologous recombination (HR) resulting in persistent DNA damage, as evidenced by enhanced tail moment and sustained γH2AX formation. This impaired DNA damage repair (DDR) sensitized tumor cells to ionizing radiation (IR). Notably, several DDR inhibitors (i) (including PARPi and ATMi) showed the highest synergy score in a targeted pharmacological screening. In vivo, dual ENPP1/ATM inhibition heightened radiosensitivity, compromised tumor cell survival and enhanced STING-TBK1 signaling by preventing ENPP1-mediated cGAMP hydrolysis. This resulted in robust innate and long-lasting adaptive antitumor immune memory responses, leading to significant tumor regression. Remarkably, combined treatment post-IR reduced spontaneous metastasis and local recurrence, and induced abscopal effects that impacted distant tumor spread in orthotopic tumor models. Thus, these findings position ENPP1 as a critical link between genome integrity and immunosuppression, offering promising translational opportunities for treating local or distant dissemination in TNBC.">

        <tr id="By offering a precise, effective, and adaptable method for genome editing, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) technology has completely transformed genetic biotechnology. Through a biochemical lens that highlights the molecular complexities behind its methods and discoveries, this review explores the complex field of CRISPR cloning and its emerging frontiers. We examine the molecular underpinnings of target identification, protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) specificity, and Cas nuclease activation, starting with the groundbreaking discovery of CRISPR-Cas systems in bacterial adaptive immunity. Advances in CRISPR-based cloning techniques, such as the creation of synthetic guide RNAs, Cas variants with specific functions, and high-fidelity and base-editing systems that reduce off-target effects, are also examined in the study. The molecular dynamics of DNA-RNA-protein interactions during gene targeting, activation of DNA repair pathways, and epigenetic state regulation are given special attention. We investigate cutting-edge uses beyond traditional genome editing, including RNA-targeting Cas proteins (like Cas13), CRISPR-based diagnostics and treatments, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa). Additionally covered is the incorporation of CRISPR with other biochemical technologies, such as gene drives, programmable transcription factors, and synthetic biology circuits. The field's increasing biochemical sophistication is highlighted by new developments like CRISPR-nanoparticle conjugates for targeted delivery and CRISPR screening platforms for functional genomics. In the end, this review emphasizes how a thorough biochemical comprehension of CRISPR systems is essential to maximizing their potential in environmental engineering, biotechnology, medicine, and agriculture.">

        <tr id="Rare genetic DNA repair deficiency syndromes can lead to immunodeficiency, neurological disorders, and cancer. In the general population, inter-individual variation in DNA repair capacity (DRC) influences susceptibility to cancer and several age-related diseases. Genome wide association studies and functional analyses show that defects in multiple DNA repair pathways jointly increase disease risk, but previous technologies did not permit comprehensive analyses of DNA repair in populations. To overcome these limitations, we used fluorescence multiplex host cell reactivation (FM-HCR) assays that directly quantify DRC across six major DNA repair pathways. We assessed DRC in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated primary lymphocytes from 56 healthy individuals and validated assay reproducibility in 10 individuals with up to five independent blood draws. We furthermore developed generalized analytical pipelines for systematically adjusting for batch effects and both experimental and biological confounders. Our results reveal significant inter-individual variation in DRC for each of 10 reporter assays that measure the efficiency of distinct repair processes. Our data also demonstrate that correlations between the activities of different DNA repair pathways are relatively weak. This finding suggests that each pathway may independently influence susceptibility to the health effects of DNA damage. We furthermore developed a pipeline for analyzing comet repair kinetics and related our new functional data to previously reported comet assay data for the same individuals. Our pioneering analysis underscores the sensitivity of FM-HCR assays for detecting subtle biological differences between individuals and establishes standardized methodologies for population studies. Our findings and open source analytical tools advance precision medicine by enabling comprehensive exploration of genetic, demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors and supporting targeted interventions to enhance DNA repair and maintain genomic integrity, thereby promoting personalized healthcare and disease prevention.">

        <tr id="Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) affects genomic stability and has potential as a biomarker for the effectiveness of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, the clinical and molecular profile of HRD in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in the Chinese population, remains poorly characterized. Based on the next-generation sequencing data of 158 Chinese NSCLC patients, we analyzed the HRD scores of mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes and dissected the correlation between HRD state and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Alterations in HRR genes were observed in 8.9% of the patients, with ATM and BRCA2 being the most commonly affected genes. HRD-high (HRD-H) status was significantly associated with advanced disease stage (≥III) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct gene expression profiles between HRD-H and HRD-low (HRD-L) subgroups, with HRD-H tumors exhibiting predominantly downregulated genes. While EGFR mutations occurred at similar frequencies across HRD status, TP53 mutations were significantly enriched in HRD-H cases. HRD-H status correlated with higher PD-L1 positivity in NSCLC overall, but not within the lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) subgroup in our cohort. The Cancer genome atlas analysis showed higher PD-L1 protein expression in HRD-H LUAD, but not in LUSC. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis identified enrichment of complement and coagulation cascades, ABC transporters, and bile secretion pathways in HRD-H tumors, suggesting links to immune evasion and drug resistance. This study elucidates the genomic landscape of HRD in Chinese NSCLC patients and provides insights into its potential clinical utility for therapeutic targeting. Our findings suggest that integrated HRD scoring may guide the application of PARP inhibitors and immunotherapy in specific NSCLC patient subgroups. Further prospective clinical studies are needed to validate the predictive value of HRD scoring in NSCLC treatment and to optimize patient selection strategies.">

        <tr id="Heterogeneity in cancer gene expression is typically linked to genetic and epigenetic alterations, yet post-transcriptional regulation likely influences these patterns as well. However, the quantitative contribution of post-transcriptional mechanisms to cancer transcriptome dynamics remains unclear. Here, we systematically measured mRNA dynamics across diverse breast cancer models, revealing that mRNA stability significantly shapes gene expression variability. To decipher the regulatory grammar underlying these dynamics, we developed GreyHound, an interpretable multimodal deep-learning framework integrating RNA sequence features and RNA-binding protein (RBP) expression. GreyHound identified an extensive network of RBPs and their regulons underlying variations in mRNA stability. Among these, we uncovered a metastasis-suppressive regulatory axis centered on the RNA-binding protein RBMS3 and its post-transcriptional control of the redox regulator TXNIP. Functional and molecular analyses revealed that RBMS3 depletion resulted in targeted transcript destabilization, which was associated with poor clinical outcomes and enhanced metastatic potential in xenograft models. Using in vivo epistasis studies, we confirmed that RBMS3 regulation of TXNIP mRNA stability drives this metastasis-suppressive program. These findings position the RBMS3-TXNIP regulatory axis as a key post-transcriptional mechanism in breast cancer and illustrate how interpretable models of RNA dynamics can uncover hidden regulatory programs in disease.">

In contrast, Class 2 mutations induce intra-luminal plasticity by reprogramming differentiated luminal cells into a progenitor-like state through activation of KLF5 and AP-1 neo-enhancer circuitries, which enables enhanced survival and proliferation even under castrate androgen levels. Our findings establish FOXA1 as a multifaceted oncogene, with distinct mutational classes divergently evolving to drive prostate tumorigenesis or therapy-resistant progression.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Blood cancers are one of the most common cancers worldwide. These diseases stem from defects in blood components having cytogenetic aberrations and genetic mutations. There have been vast improvements in terms of treatment options and survival outcomes. Nevertheless, due to the clonal nature and heterogeneity of the diseases, the number of cases reported exhibit a rising pattern due to chemoresistance and disease relapse thus posing a healthcare burden. Therefore, the need for more specific forms of targeted therapies is ever-present.


RECENT FINDINGS
CRISPR has emerged as a key player and is the epitome of gene editing technology in this post genomic era. In line with the current trend, numerous studies in blood cancer research have extensively utilized CRISPR-based applications to understand the functional genomics of hematologic malignancies and identify potential therapeutic targets for development of novel therapeutic applications.


SUMMARY
The importance of comprehending the utilities of state-of-the-art technologies such as CRISPR for studying hematologic malignancies has never been more apparent and timelier. Therefore, this review attempts to scrutinize the versatility of CRISPR applications which range from functional genomics to immunotherapeutic applications.">

        <tr id="Background The three-prime repair exonuclease 1, TREX1, degrades cytosolic DNA to prevent aberrant immune activation. Its inactivation results in DNA accumulation in the cytosol and induction of the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway, interferon signaling, and inflammation. Germline pathogenic TREX1 mutations are known to lead to hereditary autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, whereas the consequences of TREX1 mutations in cancer remain poorly understood. Results To assess the importance of human TREX1 amino acid variants, we analyzed protein sequences of the functional TREX1b isoform from 168 mammalian species and integrated available data on TREX1 sequence and copy number alterations in hereditary autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, cancer, and in human populations. While the entire TREX1b protein was conserved in placental mammals, egg-laying mammals and marsupials had their own unique C-terminal regions, with each predicted to contain a transmembrane domain. We modeled human TREX1 variants occurring in autoimmune disease and cancer samples at 12 protein positions to evaluate their predicted impact on protein stability and function. Conclusions Our findings provide novel insight into the role of TREX1 molecular variation in cancer, where genetic or epigenetic loss of TREX1 activity may improve susceptibility to treatment. However, TREX1 gene deletion in tumors was associated with unfavorable patient outcomes, most likely due its frequent co-occurrence with the loss of the entire 3p chromosomal arm, which contains known cancer-related genes.

        <tr id="XPO1 is a nuclear export receptor that is essential for cell survival. Previous genomic analyses have identified recurrent XPO1 hotspot mutations in cancer. Here, we conducted a large-scale genomic analysis of 217,570 cancer patients to identify and characterize XPO1 variants from real-world patient tumors. XPO1 harbored a R749Q mutation in various solid tumors, with a clear enrichment in endometrial and colorectal cancers, and XPO1R749Q mutations significantly co-occurred with POLE mutations. Analysis of isogenic colon cancer cell lines revealed that XPO1R749Q localized more in the cytoplasm than wildtype XPO1, with enhanced export of a large number of proteins. Structural modeling of XPO1R749Q suggested an increase in RanGTP affinity, which is consistent with enhanced protein export. A compound library screen using over 200 FDA-approved anticancer drugs indicated a general trend towards chemoresistance, specifically to topoisomerase I inhibition, in XPO1R749Q mutant cells. Mechanistically, XPO1R749Q mutant cells exhibited enhanced DNA damage response via RPA phosphorylation in response to topoisomerase I inhibition. Combining XPO1 and topoisomerase I inhibitors reduced DNA damage-induced RPA phosphorylation and mediated synergistic antitumor effects in cells harboring the XPO1R749Q mutation. Finally, the combination of selinexor and irinotecan overcame chemotherapeutic resistance in xenograft mouse models, prolonging survival. These findings suggest that XPO1 alterations in cancer are selected for in POLE mutant tumors and may confer resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapies, which have implications for patients with tumors bearing XPO1R749Q and for XPO1 inhibitor development in cancer.">

        <tr id="Cancer genomics has advanced a lot; a main problem is still turning molecular findings into treatments due to the variety of cells in each tumor and gaps in knowing certain pathway functions. Predicting whether a treatment will be effective is difficult right now which means that patient outcomes are often less than ideal. This research tackled the issue by studying whether looking at many genes and oncogenic pathways at the same time helps identify which patients may show cancer progression or treatment resistance. For this study, we looked at the genes, proteins and other molecules from a total of 1,500 patients in six major types of cancer (breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, ovarian and prostate). We used genomic variant calling, analysis of gene pathways and detailed study of proteins with advanced bioinformatics and machine learning tools. The study found that TP53 mutations (OR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.72-2.66, p < 0.001) and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway being activated (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.51-2.37, p = 0.003) were strongly linked to cancer not responding to treatment and negative outcomes. Tumors with a high number of mutations (≥ 10/Mb) reacted much better to immunotherapy (OR: 3.02, p < 0.001). Three subgroups of tumors were found through unsupervised analysis and these showed different chances of success: tumors with many mutations and high immune activity performed best (39.1% complete response), but those with mutations in PI3K and TP53 had the worst prognosis (28.5% progressive disease). Patients whose tumors were active in the PI3K/AKT pathway had progression-free survival of 8.2 months, significantly less (log-rank p < 0.001) than those whose tumors were not active. Evidence shows that integrative molecular profiling is better at predicting outcomes than the traditional method of classifying tumors by looking at slides. Study results show which molecular subgroups are most important to oncology and help link their treatment response to which therapy is best,">

Using cross-sectional bulk sequencing data, TEATIME estimates mutation rates, timing of subclone emergence, relative fitness, and number of generations of growth. To quantify intratumor fitness asymmetries, we introduce a novel metric—fitness diversity—which captures the imbalance between competing cell populations and serves as a measure of functional intratumor heterogeneity. Applying TEATIME to 33 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we revealed divergent as well as convergent evolutionary patterns. Notably, we found that immune-hot microenvironments constraint subclonal expansion and limit fitness diversity. Moreover, we detected temporal dependencies in mutation acquisition, where early driver mutations in ancestral clones epistatically shape the fitness landscape, predisposing specific subclones to selective advantages. These findings underscore the importance of intratumor competition and tumor-microenvironment interactions in shaping evolutionary trajectories, driving intratumor heterogeneity. Lastly, we demonstrate that TEATIME-derived evolutionary parameters and fitness diversity offer novel prognostic insights across multiple cancer types.">

 The apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide- like 3 (APOBEC3 or A3) family of cytosine deaminases has been implicated in some of the most prevalent mutational signatures in cancer. A3-associated mutational signatures have been identified in more than 70% of cancer types and around 50% of all cancer genomes, with prominence in breast cancer as well as other cancer types. Many tumors are hypermutated by C-to-T/G mutations induced by A3 within TCW (W:T,A) motifs, accounting for many driver mutations in genes such as PIK3CA, ERBB2, and PPP2R1A. The genome and transcriptome of tumor tissue biopsies contain a wealth of information about these A3-associated signatures. However, quantification of A3 expression changes in tumor cells is confounded by the ubiquitous expression of these enzymes in infiltrating immune cells. To overcome this we will utilize single-cell RNA-seq analysis across a wide range of publicly available breast cancer datasets in order to follow the relative changes of A3 expression within individual cell types. Results from this analysis will give our lab insights into to changes in A3 expression in tumor cells which will be helpful in unveiling the complex relationships among breast cancer cells, stromal elements, and immune cells, facilitating the development of personalized therapies and prognostic markers, while also shedding light on breast cancer heterogeneity and potential vulnerabilities.

        <tr id="Background Personalized immunotherapy of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) through T-cell mediated targeting of tumor-specific, mutanome-encoded neoepitopes may offer new opportunities to combat this disease, in particular by countering recurrence after primary tumor resection. However, the sensitive and accurate calling of somatic mutations in PDAC tissue samples is compromised by the low tumor cell content. Moreover, the repertoire of immunogenic neoepitopes in PDAC is limited due to the low mutational load of the majority of these tumors. Methods We developed a workflow involving the combined analysis of next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing data from matched pairs of primary tumor samples and patient-derived xenograft models towards the enhanced detection of driver mutations as well as single nucleotide variants encoding potentially immunogenic T-cell neoepitopes. Subsequently, we immunized HLA/human T-cell receptor (TCR) locus-transgenic mice with synthetic peptides representing candidate neoepitopes, and molecularly cloned the genes encoding TCRs targeting these epitopes. Result Application of our pipeline resulted in the identification of greater numbers of non-synonymous mutations encoding candidate neoepitopes with increased confidence. Furthermore, we provide proof of concept for the successful isolation of HLA-restricted TCRs from humanized mice immunized with different neoepitopes, several of which would not have been selected based on mutanome analysis of PDAC tissue samples alone. These TCRs mediate specific T-cell reactivity against the tumor cells in which the corresponding mutations were identified. Conclusion Enhanced mutanome analysis and candidate neoepitope selection increase the likelihood of identifying therapeutically relevant neoepitopes, and thereby support the optimization of personalized immunotherapy for PDAC and other poorly immunogenic cancers.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy defined by the clonal expansion of undifferentiated myeloid blasts with a block in differentiation and aberrant self-renewal. While recurrent genomic mutations are well-documented in AML, epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as an equally pivotal driver of leukemogenesis, a notion corroborated by the frequent recurrence of mutations in epigenetic regulators. Leukemic cells exhibit pervasive epigenetic alterations-including abnormal DNA methylation patterns, dysregulated histone modification, disrupted chromatin architecture and RNA-based regulatory mechanisms -which collectively rewire gene expression programs. These changes silence key differentiation genes and sustain self-renewal pathways, enforcing the developmental arrest and hyper-proliferation that are the hallmarks of AML. Importantly, epigenetic aberrations in AML are not merely downstream consequences of genetic lesions but actively contribute to the malignant phenotype. Somatic mutations frequently target epigenetic regulators (for example, DNA methyltransferases or histone modifiers), and these lesions cooperate with other genetic alterations to initiate and maintain the leukemic clone. Together, these insights highlight epigenetic dysregulation as a central mechanism in AML pathogenesis.">

For the reasons mentioned above, PTTG1 stands out as a multifaceted regulator of cancer biology; it is involved in genomic and chromosomal instability, local invasiveness, neo-lymphangiogenesis, and metastatic spreading. In solid neoplasms, endocrine neoplasms, although deemed rare, have experienced a significant increase in diagnostic incidence in recent years. Endocrine cancers are still a major challenge in healthcare and research since several questions remain unanswered, even though researchers have made considerable efforts to uncover their causes. Twenty-seven years have passed since PTTG1's discovery, and several works have been published. However, only the tip of the iceberg has been unveiled.

 Background: Hormone Receptor Positive (HR+) breast cancer is predominantly managed with endocrine therapies that target the Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα), a key mediator of estrogen's role in promoting tumor growth. However, the emergence of endocrine resistance poses a significant clinical challenge, limiting the efficacy of these treatments and impeding optimal patient outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms behind ERα's importance and the development of resistance is crucial for advancing therapeutic strategies against HR+ breast cancer. Methods: In our study, we utilized the GEO database to identify ADP-Ribosylation Factor-Like GTPase 3 (ARL3) as a gene associated with tamoxifen resistance in HR+ breast cancer. We constructed cell lines with ARL3 knockout and overexpression to assess the impact of ARL3 on cell proliferation, migration, and tamoxifen sensitivity. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) were employed to demonstrate the influence of ARL3 knockout on downstream ERα pathways. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP), immunofluorescence and Western blot (WB) assays confirmed the role of ARL3 in the ubiquitination and degradation pathway of ERα. Results: In our analysis of TCGA breast cancer subtypes, we also observed that ARL3 is highly expressed in luminal breast cancer. Additionally, our collection of breast cancer tissue mRNA and immunohistochemistry data revealed that ARL3 expression is elevated in HR+ breast cancer, indicating a correlation with estrogen receptors. We found that ARL3 promotes the proliferation and migration of HR+ breast cancer. Furthermore, overexpression of ARL3 was associated with reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen, and in vivo tumorigenesis in nude mice showed that tumor volume and weight were significantly decreased compared to the control group. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, RNA-seq analysis of ARL3 knockout and control groups revealed a pronounced inhibition of the MYC pathway. Western blot (WB) validation confirmed that ARL3 knockout suppresses the expression of downstream pathways of ERα. Our data suggest that the association between ARL3 and ERα primarily occurs in the cytoplasm, mainly binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ERα, which is consistent with ARL3 not being recruited to the promoters occupied by ERα. We also discovered that the ARL3/ERα cascade promotes mitochondrial autophagy to enhance mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In summary, our study establishes a non-genomic mechanism whereby ARL3 controls the transcription of estrogen-dependent genes associated with breast cancer cell proliferation by stabilizing ERα levels. Conclusion: In our study, we posit that ADP-ribosylation factor-like GTPase 3 (ARL3) exerts a pivotal influence on the proliferative capacity, metastatic potential, and responsiveness to endocrine therapies in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. ARL3 modulates the stability of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), thereby regulating the activation of downstream signaling cascades and the mitochondrial functionality within neoplastic cells. Our findings suggest that ARL3 represents a promising therapeutic target for HR+ breast cancer. We envision that in-depth investigation into the molecular underpinnings of ARL3's role could pave the way for the development of innovative pharmacological agents capable of overcoming endocrine resistance in patients, ultimately enhancing their clinical outcomes and survival rates.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Clinical outcomes can be linked to the fundamental role played by the regulatory 3D architecture of the genome in a living cell and the unique properties offered as a molecular biomarker modality. Here, we describe how this molecular phenomenon acts as an imprint of the cellular genetic, epigenetic and metabolic status which form discriminatory stable conditional structures that inform on the state of the cell and its phenotype. Consequently, 3D architecture, as a biomarker, offers a more comprehensive translation from molecular readouts to clinical outcomes, with examples and evidence provided by the highly accurate diagnostic and prognostic clinical tests already reduced to practice in the US and UK. Moreover, with support from Large Language Models, we can elucidate the complexities and inter-relationships of molecular pathways and regulation using a 3D genomic architecture knowledge base, to gain insights into various molecular modalities and associated clinical conditions. Abstract Background/Objectives: The 3-dimensional (3D) architecture of the genome in the nucleus of a living cell plays an unexpected yet fundamental regulatory role in cell biology. As an imprint of the cellular genetic, epigenetic and metabolic status, it discriminates pathological conditions through conditional changes to long-range 3D interactions (up to 300 kb) and thus could act as a powerful molecular biomarker linked closely to clinical outcomes. Methods: Here an assessment is made of the latest paradigm shift in molecular biology from a supply chain where information flows from DNA to RNA to protein, to the concept of heritable 3D folding of the genome reflecting the epigenetic and metabolic state of the cell, and which serves as a molecular biomarker for complex clinical outcome. Results: While biomarkers based on individual components of the supply chain fail to accurately reflect clinical outcomes, 3D genomics offers highly informative insights, exemplified for immuno-oncology and prostate cancer diagnosis by clinical tests of superior performance, already in practice in the US and UK. Conclusions: A more complete understanding of human biology will require models that account for the flow of information to and from the 3D genomic architecture in living cells, together with its regulation and logic. Integrating these principles into biomarker discovery and therapeutic design, along with other frontline approaches in precision medicine, including multi-omics and other system-level tools, will be essential for advancing precision medicine beyond its current limitations.">

        <tr id="Abstract G-quadruplexes (G4s) are four-stranded alternative secondary structures formed by guanine-rich nucleic acids and are prevalent across the human genome. G4s are enzymatically resolved by specialized helicases. Previous in vitro studies showed that DEAH-box helicase 36 (DHX36/G4R1/RHAU) has the highest specificity and affinity for G4 structures. Here, by mapping genome-wide DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), we demonstrate that knockout of DHX36 helicase increases DSB enrichment at G4 sites and that the presence of the G4 motif is a significant mediator of genome instability at regulatory regions. The loss of DHX36 corresponds with the significant upregulation of NF-κB transcriptional programs, culminating in the production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Loss of DHX36 expression results in the accumulation of cytoplasmic DNA fragments, an increase in the innate immune signaling stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1 (STING1) expression, and activation of genes involved in immune response pathways. Importantly, higher levels of DHX36 messenger RNA expression in human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia correlate with improved overall survival relative to lower expression of DHX36, highlighting its critical role in preserving genome integrity at a cellular level and in the context of cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Resveratrol (RSV) is one of the most studied and used biomolecules, for which many pharmacological effects targeting multiple tissues have been described. However, a common underlying mechanism driving its full pharmacological activity has not been described in detail. G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical nucleic acid structures found in regulatory genomic locations and involved in controlling gene transcription, telomere maintenance, or genome stability, among others. This study provides a genome-wide characterization of RSV G4-binding properties, explaining its multi-target traits. Methods Immunofluorescence assays using a nucleolar and a G4-specific antibody were used to characterize RSV cellular effects on the nucleolus and G4 stabilization. DNA damage and cell cycle analyses were performed via western blot and flow cytometry. Breaks lLbeling In Situ and Sequencing (BLISS) was used to map double strand breaks (DSB) in response to treatment, and identify G4s targeted by RSV. mRNA sequencing was used to identify changes at the transcriptional level upon treatment and relate them to a direct targeting of G4s. Biophysical assays (circular dichroism, ultraviolet–visible [UV–Vis] titration, differential scanning calorimetry, and nuclear magnetic resonance) were used to characterize RSV–G4 interactions. Lastly, luciferase-based transcription assays were performed to confirm RSV–G4 interaction in vitro and its direct influence on gene expression. Results In a cellular context, RSV treatment showed classic G4-ligand effects, such as nucleolar disassembly, inhibition of RNA polymerase I, DNA damage, and cell cycle arrest. RSV was shown to stabilize cellular G4s, which accumulated around double strand breaks in the promoters of differentially expressed genes. Upon treatment, G4 stabilization triggered DNA damage and controlled gene expression. The interaction between RSV and target G4s was confirmed in vitro by biophysical assays and through luciferase-based transcription assays. Conclusions A G4-dependent mode of action was demonstrated as the main mechanism underlying RSV pleiotropic effects, along with the identification of target genes and G4s. This in-depth analysis of the mode of action of RSV will be helpful to improve its therapeutic potential in a wide variety of health scenarios.

 Molecular profiling of tumors using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) enables the detection of genetic alterations associated with response to targeted therapies, as well as the assessment of genomic scars indicative of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). HRD serves as a critical biomarker for predicting response to PARP inhibitors. In this study, the efficiency of a 1021-gene NGS panel was evaluated for HRD status analysis in comparison with validated methodologies in ovarian cancer tissues.
 Methods:
 A total of 43 tumor samples from 34 patients with known HRD status, based on validated Myriad and OncoScan methodologies, were analyzed. The NGS-based analysis (Gene+) included sequencing of 1021 genes and evaluation of genomic instability. Genomic instability was assessed using three key biological parameters: LOH (Loss of Heterozygosity), TAI (Telomeric Allelic Imbalance), and LST (Large-Scale Transitions). Key evaluation criteria included HRD score concordance, BRCA1/2 mutation detection, and methodology reproducibility.
 Results:
 HRD status showed a concordance rate of 97.1% (33/34) between the 1021+HRD panel and the validated Myriad test (Table 1). Discrepancies were observed in one sample, with an HRD score of 43 based on the 1021-gene panel, compared to 35 (Myriad), suggesting potential differences near the cutoff threshold. Sensitivity for BRCA1/2 mutation detection was 100%. Additionally, reproducibility of HRD detection was 100% across 12 repeated samples. Positive HRD scores remained consistent even at low TCC levels (≥20%), with an agreement rate of 95.7% (22/23).
 Conclusions:
 The new NGS methodology demonstrated high concordance with validated methodologies for HRD detection, robust BRCA mutation identification, and excellent reproducibility. These findings support its clinical utility for guiding therapeutic decisions with PARP inhibitors.

 Background:
 According to the recent 2022-2024 published data from the GLOBOCAN, India alone contributed 15.5% of these cases with a staggering 26% of Breast carcinoma (BC) cases and 0.85 million people succumbed to the disease. Inherited or spontaneous mutations in HRR group of genes can disrupt DNA damage response signaling, impairing HRR and sensitizing cells to genotoxic insults. The current study brings to fore the spectrum of clinically significant and novel HRR pathway gene alterations in breast carcinoma patients with increased TNBC incidence.
 Methods:
 A total of 301, histologically diagnosed breast carcinoma patients were included for germline molecular assessment of HRR pathway genes via Ion Torrent NGS following manufacturer’s protocol from January,2019 to December,2023. Clinical summary and an informed consent were obtained individually from the patients.
 Results:
 Out of the total of 301 BC patients participated in the study, 119(39.53%) were diagnosed TNBC cases. NGS data revealed 76(25.2%) patients to harbour at least one clinically significant HRR pathway gene variant. Predominantly, BRCA2 was the most mutated gene (47.3%), followed by BRCA1 (43.4%) across patients. 41(34.4%) TNBC cases were detected with a pathogenic gene variant. In the mutation spectrum, exon-10 (27.9%) of BRCA1 and exon-11 (52.7%) of BRCA2 genes were the most mutated regions detected. Additionally, findings revealed 11 novel variants across HRR genes. Six novel variants in BRCA1 (exon-10,
 c.1039_1040insA,
 c.2841delA; exon-16, c
 .5009delG
 (02) and, exon-23,
 C.5519_5573del
 ) (02), four in BRCA2 (exon-10,
 c.1249_1250insT
 ; exon-11,
 c.4287_4288insT
 ; exon-14, c
 .7279_7280insC
 and exon-24,
 c.9241_9242insA
 ) and one in FANCD2 (exon-21, c.1900G>A) genes respectively. Also, BRCA1 founder mutation (185delAG) was also observed in two (2.6%) patients. CHEK2, PIK3CA, FANCD2 and TP53 were the other HRR pathway genes found positive in the cohort.
 Conclusions:
 Examining the complete BRCA gene status in patient cohort has enabled the identification of not only recurring pathogenic variants but also novel mutations. Among BC patients, an elevated frequency of TNBC patients (39.53%) is an alarming finding compared to the global incidence of 15-20%. The findings enable promising targeted therapeutic approaches by matching patients to treatments which is most likely to benefit them. With the views over the years and with the projected trends in the coming years, BC is set to remain in the driving seat, to drive the national and global cancer burden. Hence, population-based screening, population based molecular-genetic study updates and novel approaches in different strata of the disease are needed with the fast-moving cancer trend in the global society.

 Background:
 Homozygous deletion of the MTAP occurs in 10-15% of all human cancers. MTAP catalyzes the conversion of MTA (S-adenosylmethionine) into methionine, playing a role in cellular energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Currently, numerous PRMT5 inhibitor drugs are being developed. Accurately detecting the status of MTAP is particularly important. Until recently, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) served as the gold standard for detection of 9p21 loss. However, there is an increasing demand for NGS-based of MTAP deletion detection due to its ease of application and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, we have developed a panel-based detection method that can accurately determine deletion status of MTAP.
 Methods:
 In this study, we utilized a NGS panel that covers more than 2000 SNP loci within the genome. The sequencing depth was greater than 500X. To obtain the absolute copy number of the tumor, an algorithm was employed to correct the log2Ratio for each bin by utilizing the offset between tumor purity and log2Ratio. To validate the accuracy of this method, clinical samples from 41 cases were selected for simultaneous FISH testing and the NGS panel detection mentioned above. An additional 1260 clinical samples were selected for NGS testing to confirm the incidence of all exon deletions and partial loss.
 Results:
 All samples were successfully detected. Among 41 cases, FISH and NGS accurately identified 28 homozygous deletions and 11 heterozygous deletions; 2 samples incorrectly identified. The overall consistency in status determination reached 95% (39/41). Using the above algorithm to evaluation additional samples, 17% of the deletions can be accurately identified, including 60.7% of homozygous deletion. The detection rates of MTAP homozygous deletion in different cancer types are similar to the TCGA data. Specifically, it was observed that non-small cell lung cancer had a frequency of 16.7%, head and neck cancer of 17.3%, urothelial carcinoma of 40.4%, colorectal of 3.0%, pancreatic of 18.0%, glioma of 21.0%, and esophageal of 19.5%. The algorithm can accurately categorize all identified deletions into two groups: 13.8% complete gene deletions and 3.2% partial exon deletions. The multiple exon loss frequcies inclued exon 5-8 loss in 2.8% , exon 6-8 loss in 1.4%, exon 7-8 loss in 4.7% , exon 8 loss in 7.5% and other less common multi-exon losses.
 Conclusions:
 The NGS-based method established in this study for detecting MTAP deletion demonstrates a high consistency of 95% with FISH. Furthermore, it shows superior performance to FISH in detecting partial exon loss. This research method holds potential for application in companion diagnostics for drug therapy.

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, with persistent challenges in overcoming treatment resistance and recurrence. Lactic acid was once considered a metabolic waste, but now it is considered a multifunctional coordinator of GC progression. This review synthesizes emerging evidence on lactate’s multifaceted roles in GC progression, elucidating lactate's multifaceted roles in GC pathogenesis, including its regulation of tumor metabolic heterogeneity, epigenetic reprogramming, and immune microenvironment remodeling. Lactate fosters metabolic symbiosis between glycolytic and oxidative tumor cells, sustains chemoresistance via histone lactylation, RNA methylation, and chromatin phase separation, and promotes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling and immune evasion by suppressing CD8+ T-cell function and polarizing tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) towards an M2 phenotype. and polarizing tumor-associated macrophages. Critically, lactate synergizes with Helicobacter pylori (Hp) to form a microbiome-metabolite axis that amplifies bacterial virulence, induces genomic instability, and accelerates malignant transformation. Therapeutic strategies targeting lactate production (LDH-A inhibitors), transport (MCT1/4 blockers), and signaling (epigenetic modulators/lactylation inhibitors) show promise in disrupting these oncogenic circuits. Nanotechnology-driven approaches and microbiome modulation (engineered probiotics) further enhance precision delivery and efficacy. Understanding the interplay between lactate, the tumor microenvironment (TME), and microbial communities offers novel avenues for overcoming therapeutic resistance and improving GC outcomes.

 Background:
 Driver-negative lung adenocarcinoma (DN-LUAD) without actionable genomic alterations (AGAs) has a poor prognosis. A deeper understanding of its molecular background, particularly across the entire genome, is crucial for improving risk assessment and therapeutic development.
 Methods:
 We performed deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS; tumor depth: 100–120x, normal depth: 30x, paired-end reads: 150 bp) and RNA sequencing using fresh-frozen tissues from four institutions. DN-LUAD was defined as LUAD without known actionable mutations or gene fusions. We analyzed somatic mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs), and structural variations (SVs). Tumors were classified as whole-genome doubling (WGD) if more than half of the autosomal tumor genome showed at least two copies in the major copy numbers of somatic cells. HRDetect score ≥0.7 was used to determine the presence of homologous recombination DNA repair deficiency (HRD) (Davies H, et al. Nat Med. 2017). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used for pathway analysis.
 Results:
 Among the 745 patients (pts), 517 were classified as having DN-LUAD. WGS identified AGAs undetected by whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 33 (4.4%) pts (

 1). The frequently observed genomic alterations in DN-LUAD are shown in the Table. WGD was observed in 62.1% (n = 321) of DN-LUADs and was significantly associated with higher TMB, CNA, and SV burden. Tumor suppressor gene (TSG) mutations in
 TP53
 ,
 STK11
 , and
 KEAP1
 , as well as
 CDKN2A
 copy number loss and SVs, were significantly more frequent in WGD pts. HRD was identified in 19 DN-LUAD pts (3.7%), with a significantly higher frequency in the WGD group (WGD vs. without WGD; 4.98% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.016). GSEA showed significant (q < 0.0001) upregulation of cell cycle pathways (E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, and MYC targets) and downregulation of immune pathways (allograft rejection and interferon-gamma response) in DN-LUADs with WGD.
 Conclusions:
 This largest-ever WGS study identified AGAs undetectable by WES and uncovered a subgroup of DN-LUAD characterized by increased genomic instability driven by multiple TSG alterations associated with WGD, which was also more likely to exhibit HRD. WGD was associated with the upregulation of cell cycle pathways and the downregulation of immune pathways. These findings highlight the critical role of WGS in elucidating the pathogenesis of DN-LUAD.

 Background:
 Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and has an overall cure rate of approximately 60%. Previously, we observed high PIM1 mutation rates in DLBCL patients with poor outcome. However, the mechanism whether they lead to enhanced PIM1 kinase activity and contribute to lymphomagenesis is currently unknown.
 Methods:
 In this study, a multifaceted approach was employed to elucidate the functional consequences of PIM1 gene mutations and their implications in DLBCL. Recurrent PIM1 gene mutations that exhibited high frequencies across various lymphoma cohorts from public databases were screened and patient outcomes were stratified by PIM1 genen mutational sites. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis combined with Co-IP was used to identify proteins interacting with PIM1. Transcriptomics analysis was utilized to identify proteins involved in critical cellular pathways relevant to PIM1 mutation. A high-throughput drug screening platform was leveraged to find potential therapeutic vulnerabilities unique to PIM1 mutant cells. The antiproliferative effects of PIM1 and PI3K inhibitor were evaluated in DLBCL cell lines and further validated in NSG mouse xenograft models.
 Results:
 We have identified PIM1 mutations, specifically P81S, E135K, L184F, and S97N, as frequently occurring variants, with the former three significantly associated with poor outcome. In particular, the PIM1
 L184F
 mutation promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in vitro and showed faster tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, the PIM1
 L184F
 mutation was found to interact with the annexin A2 (ANXA2) gene, activating it through phosphorylation of serine 26. The activated ANXA2 gene then translocated from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane, binding with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene and recruiting BCAP to the cell membrane to interact with p85α further activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Additionally, the high-throughput drug screening demonstrated that the PIM1
 L184F
 mutated cells were more sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor YY20394. PIM1 inhibitor SMI-4a combined with YY20394 showed synergistic antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo.
 Conclusions:
 Taken together, these findings not only shed light on an innovative regulatory mechanism for how PIM1
 L184F
 mutation contributes to the pathogenesis of DLBCL but also provide a potential therapeutic strategy for effectively managing DLBCL patients harboring PIM1
 L184F
 mutation.

        <tr id="The problem of interpretation of the genetic data from patients with inherited cardiovascular diseases still remains relevant. To date, the clinical significance of approximately 40 % of variants in genes associated with inherited cardiovascular diseases is uncertain, which requires new approaches to the assessment of their pathogenetic contribution. A combination of the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and editing the iPSC genome with CRISPR/Cas9 is thought to be the most promising tool for clarifying variant pathogenicity. A variant of unknown significance in MYH7, p.Met659Ile (c.1977G>A), was previously identified in several genetic screenings of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients. In this study, the single nucleotide substitution was corrected with CRISPR/Cas9 in iPSCs generated from a carrier of the variant. As a result, two iPSC lines (ICGi019-B-1 and ICGi019-B-2) were generated and characterized using a standard set of methods. The iPSC lines with the corrected p.Met659Ile (c.1977G>A) variant in MYH7 possessed a morphology characteristic of human pluripotent cells, expressed markers of the pluripotent state (the OCT4, SOX2, NANOG transcription factors and SSEA-4 surface antigen), were able to give rise to derivatives of three germ layers during spontaneous differentiation, and retained a normal karyotype (46,XY). No CRISPR/Cas9 off-target activity was found in the ICGi019-B-1 and ICGi019-B-2 iPSC lines. The maintenance of the pluripotent state and normal karyotype and the absence of CRISPR/Cas9 off-target activity in the iPSC lines with the corrected p.Met659Ile (c.1977G>A) variant in MYH7 allow using the iPSC lines as an isogenic control for further studies of the variant pathogenicity and its impact on the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy development.">

However, recent findings expand the CPC's role beyond cell division, uncovering novel functions in replication stress response and genome stability maintenance. In our recent study by Falke et al. [1], we demonstrate that CPC components, particularly Survivin and Aurora B, contribute to the protection of stalled replication forks and facilitate translesion synthesis (TLS) - a specialized DNA damage tolerance mechanism. This regulation involves a functional interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a central coordinator of DNA replication and repair. The work not only reshapes our understanding of CPC biology but also reveals a mechanistic link how tumor cells may exploit CPC activity to maintain replication under genotoxic stress. These findings open new avenues for targeting CPC-PCNA interactions in cancers characterized by elevated replication stress.">

        <tr id="Purpose The tumor microenvironment (TME) may provide a useful framework for understanding the heterogeneous behavior of growth hormone (GH) secreting pituitary adenomas. Although the interest in TME in somatotropinomas has increased exponentially over the last few decades, there is limited elucidation of its mechanisms, particularly in relation to genes expression involved in its regulation. Methods A retrospective, observational, single-center study was conducted on 85 subjects: 46 patients diagnosed with acromegaly and 39 controls. After DNA extraction, clinical exome sequencing was performed and genomic alterations were detected, classified, and filtered using a dedicated bioinformatics pipeline. Results 5759 unique genetic variants were found in patients with acromegaly. 33 patients (72%) showed the presence of at least one pathogenic variant in at least one of the following genes: FANCD2, SPTA1, TYRO3, and ZNF335. The enrichment pathway analysis of mutated genes was performed and showed that these genes were included in the same genetic pathway called “regulation of lymphocyte activation” (GO:0051249). Inflammatory infiltrate was analyzed in histological samples in 26 patients. A significantly higher number of CD68 + macrophages (P-value = 0.008), a lower number of CD8 + T lymphocytes (P-value = 0.037) and a higher CD68 + macrophages/ CD8 + T-lymphocytes ratio (P-value = 0.004) were observed in patients with pathogenic variants of genes of “regulation of lymphocyte activation” pathway. Conclusion This study provides new insights into the genetic basis of the TME in somatotropinomas and suggests that genetics may influence immune cells infiltration in acromegaly.

        <tr id="Background CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), the repurposing of the RNA-guided endonuclease dCas9 as a programmable transcriptional repressor, allows highly specific repression (knockdown) of gene expression. CRISPRi platforms can often have incomplete knockdown, performance variability across cell lines and gene targets, and inconsistencies dependent on the guide RNA sequence employed. Results Here, we explore the combination of novel repressor domains with strong Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repressors, screening > 100 bipartite and tripartite fusion proteins for their ability to reduce gene expression as CRISPRi effectors. We show that these novel repressor fusions have reduced dependence on guide RNA sequences, better slow cell growth when used to knock down expression of essential genes, and function in either fusion or scaffold modalities. Furthermore, we isolate and characterize a particularly effective CRISPRi platform, dCas9-ZIM3(KRAB)-MeCP2(t), which shows improved gene repression of endogenous targets both at the transcript and protein level across several cell lines and when deployed in genome-wide screens. Conclusions We posit that these novel repressor fusions can enhance the reproducibility and utility of CRISPRi in mammalian cells.

        <tr id="An individual’s genetics contributes to their risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); however, there is still a large proportion of the heritability of ALS to be understood. Part of this missing heritability may lie in complex variants, such as the long interspersed element 1 (L1) retrotransposon, which have yet to be evaluated. The majority of L1 insertions in the human genome are no longer able to retrotranspose, but to date 279 retrotransposition-competent (RC) L1s have been reported. Many RC-L1s are polymorphic for their presence/absence; therefore, each individual will have a different number and complement of RC-L1s. These elements have been hypothesized to be involved in disease processes by multiple mechanisms such as somatic mutation by retrotransposition, the triggering of neuroinflammation and DNA damage. We hypothesize that L1s may influence disease development either through their effects on endogenous genes or through the properties that enable them to retrotranspose. Whole genome sequencing data from the New York Genome Center ALS consortium were used to characterize L1 variation identifying 2,803 polymorphic L1 elements and association analysis was performed in European individuals (ALS/ALS with other neurological disorder (ALSND) n = 2,653, controls n = 320). There were no individual L1 elements associated with disease, but we did identify a significant increase in the number of RC-L1s in ALS/ALSND genomes (p = 0.01) and the presence of ≥46 RC-L1s showed the most significant association (OR = 1.09 (1.02–1.16), p = 0.01) with disease. Analysis of individual L1s and their association with age at onset and survival identified one L1 whose presence was significantly associated with a lower age at onset (52.7 years) compared to homozygous absent individuals (59.2 years) (padj = 0.009). Our study has identified novel genetic factors for both disease risk and age at onset in ALS providing further evidence for the role of L1 retrotransposons in neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in gene regulation and have been implicated in various physiological processes and disease conditions. DNA methylation (DNAm) has been implicated in the etiology and progression of many stress-related psychiatric behaviors, such as depression. The ability to manipulate DNAm may provide a means to reverse and treat such disorders. Although CRISPR-based technologies have enabled locus-specific DNAm editing, their clinical applicability may be limited due to immunogenicity concerns and off-target effects. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for targeted DNAm manipulation using single-stranded methylated DNA probes. The probes were designed against the GRE of FKBP5 and the promoter region of MAOA. In both human embryonic kidney HEK293 and mouse pituitary AtT-20 cells, transfection with their respective methylated probes significantly increased DNAm at targeted CpG sites in a persistent and dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the induced methylation effectively attenuated glucocorticoid-induced upregulation of FKBP5 gene expression. Alteration of methylation was specific to single-stranded probes, as double-stranded methylated probes and unmethylated probes showed no significant effects. Some limitations include the need to further characterize factors that influence probe efficiency, such as probe length and CpG density; develop an efficient in vivo probe delivery system; and perform a more extensive consideration of possible off-target effects. Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that methylated DNA probes have the potential to function as a simple tool for targeted epigenetic manipulation and serve as a safer alternative to CRISPR-based epigenome editing tools for the treatment of stress-related disorders such as depression.">

 Background:
 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy with a median survival of 9–11 months. Despite the addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to frontline chemotherapy, improvements remain limited. SCLC evades anti-tumor immunity by suppressing major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and antigen presentation (AP). The variability of MHC repression across molecular subtypes of SCLC and high-grade neuroendocrine tumors is not fully understood. This study analyzed clinical SCLC and neuroendocrine tumor samples to identify molecular subtypes and regulators of MHC repression, enhancing the understanding of immune evasion.
 Methods:
 Molecular profiling was conducted on 944 SCLC and 5056 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors using next-generation DNA (592-gene panel/whole exome), RNA (whole transcriptome) sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Transcriptomic profiling of 40 SCLC cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) was also performed.
 Results:
 Key regulators and gene networks driving MHC-I suppression in SCLC and other high-grade neuroendocrine tumors were identified. Canonical (MHC-I and II) and non-canonical AP expression scores characterized the spectrum of MHC-I repression across subtypes. Low MHC-I scores correlated with reduced immune signatures (e.g., T cell-inflamed, NK cell, and STING pathway signatures; Spearman = 0.87, 0.58, 0.62, respectively) and predicted poor OS and PFS to immunotherapy. Enhancer network and gene expression analyses identified actionable regulators of MHC-I repression, including interferon signaling. Knockout studies of top MHC-I regulators and single cell analyses revealed non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) genes (like DNAPKCs) inversely correlated with HLA-A/B/C expression. DNAPKCs inhibition upregulated MHC-I, TAP1, and TAP2, enhanced antigen-specific T-cell-mediated cytolysis in SCLC. This inhibition activated the STING pathway, increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and enhanced MHC Class-I. Combining DNAPKCs inhibitor NU1774 with anti-PD-L1 reactivated MHC-I and led to significant tumor regression in aggressive murine SCLC models, supporting new combination therapies.
 Conclusions:
 We identified molecular subtypes and actionable pathways to restore MHC-I expression in SCLC, advancing understanding of immune evasion mechanisms. DNAPKCs is established as a key therapeutic target, enhancing PD-L1 blockade by reactivating antigen presentation. The developed MHC-I expression scores and associated biomarkers offer predictive tools for identifying patients likely to benefit from immunotherapy. These findings support biomarker-driven, personalized approaches to improve treatment for SCLC, addressing a critical unmet need in this devastating cancer.

 APOBEC3 (A3) enzymes play a pivotal role in mutagenesis across various cancer types. These enzymes, which are single-stranded DNA cytosine deaminases, convert cytosine to uracil (C-to-U) as part of innate antiviral immune responses. Aberrant expression of A3 enzymes in several cancers leads to DNA damage, mutagenesis, and genomic instability. In breast cancer, in particular, APOBEC3B (A3B) is the major endogenous mutator that contributes to tumor evolution and resistance to treatment (1–4). DNA C-to-U deamination events result in characteristic C-to-T transitions and C-to-G transversions, and genomic uracils can also be processed into single- or double-stranded DNA breaks and larger chromosomal aberrations. Consequently, tumors with elevated A3B levels endure chronic genotoxic stress and may exhibit increased sensitivity to inhibitors targeting specific DNA repair pathways. Previous research from our laboratory identified DNA uracil glycosylase 2 (UNG2), a critical initiator of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, as a synthetic lethal partner with A3B (5). Genetic disruption of UNG2, combined with high A3B expression, led to cell death (5). This finding suggests that other DNA repair proteins could potentially serve as synthetic lethal partners with A3B under conditions of elevated A3B-induced DNA damage. To test this hypothesis, we used pharmacological and genetic inhibition of DNA damage repair proteins in isogenic cell line models for A3B. Specifically, we quantified cancer cell viability following treatment with various commercially available DNA damage response inhibitors, in the presence or absence of A3B. Additionally, we performed CRISPR screens using a guide RNA library targeting 237 DNA damage repair and response genes in a doxycycline-inducible TREX-293-A3Bi-eGFP cell line. Cells expressing or lacking A3B were harvested for DNA extraction and sequencing at different time points. By comparing guide RNA abundance between doxycycline-treated cells and untreated cells, we identified dropout guides that disrupt genes, creating potential synthetic lethal combinations with A3B. The results from both pharmacological and genetic inhibition approaches will be presented.

        <tr id="GEN1 is implicated in DNA damage repair, as are several other breast cancer susceptibility genes, and is included in several comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing panels. To investigate the possible association of GEN1 variants with breast cancer risk, we sequenced this gene in 617 Polish women with hereditary breast cancer (HBC) and 300 Polish cancer-free controls. No protein-truncating variants were detected in the conserved part of GEN1 (first 480 codons). Two frameshift variants were detected in the last exon of GEN1: c.2515_2519delAAGTT (p.Lys839Glufs*2) and c.1929_1932delAAAG (p.Lys645Cysfs*29). The p.Lys839Glufs*2 variant was detected in 21.1% of 617 HBC cases and 18.4% of 300 controls (p = 0.38). The p.Lys645Cysfs*29 variant was rare, seen in 0.6% of 617 HBC cases and 0.3% of 300 controls. The variant was then detected in 38 (0.24%) of 15,930 unselected breast cancer cases and 8 (0.17%) of 4702 cancer-free female controls from Poland (OR = 1.40, p = 0.49). Clinical characteristics of breast tumors in the 38 carriers of p.Lys645Cysfs*29 and 15,892 non-carriers were similar. Survival was similar among variant carriers and non-carriers (the age-adjusted HR = 0.87, p = 0.76). The wild-type GEN1 allele was retained in all five breast cancers of carriers of p.Lys645Cysfs*29. No cancer type was more frequent in the relatives of 35 p.Lys645Cysfs*29 variant carriers compared to the relatives of 14,592 non-carriers. We conclude that GEN1 is unlikely to be a high or moderate-risk breast cancer susceptibility gene. Our study has clinical implications for genetic counseling and suggests that GEN1 changes should be reclassified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) when they are detected in clinical testing panels.">

 Background:
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer with a dismal prognosis despite advances in treatment. PDAC is characterized by a dense stromal environment with suppressed anti-tumor immunity that contributes to treatment resistance. Oncogenic
 KRAS
 mutations are present in > 90% of PDACs and are known to play a role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). In this study, we examined the differences in TME components between
 KRAS
 -mutant (m) and
 KRAS
 -wildtype (wt) PDACs.
 Methods:
 Comprehensive genomic and immune profiling (CGIP), including the RNA-seq based gene expression assessment of 395 immune-associated genes, was performed on 311 PDAC patient samples. Gene expression signatures of tumor immunogenicity (TIGS) and cell proliferation were calculated by averaging the gene expression ranks of 161 immune-associated genes and 10 proliferation genes, respectively. The normalized gene expression rank of 22 immune checkpoint genes and 17 cancer testis antigen (CTA) genes were also calculated. DNA-seq was used to identify
 KRAS
 mutations and to calculated tumor mutational burden (TMB). Continuous variables were compared between subgroups using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test and categorical variables were compared between groups using the Chi Squared test. For statistical significance, p < 0.05 was required.
 Results:
 The cohort consisted of 311 PDAC patient samples, comprising 159 females (51.1%) and 152 males (48.9%) with a median age at testing of 69.3 years (38.7-92.6). A total of 264 specimens (84.9%) exhibited a
 KRAS
 mutation, with the most common being G12D and G12V while 47 (15.1%) had
 KRAS
 -wt tumors. No difference in TIGS, CP, or TMB was observed between
 KRAS
 -wt and
 KRAS
 -m tumors.
 KRAS
 -wt tumors exhibited greater expression of 12 of 17 tested CTAs than
 KRAS
 -m tumors, including GAGE13 (p = 0.004) NY-ESO-1 (p = 0.01), MAGEA3 (p = 0.01), and LAGE1A (p = 0.01). Analysis of the gene expression of 22 immune checkpoint genes showed no difference for most of the genes, though there was higher expression of PD-1 (p = 0.04) and CD27 (p = 0.03) seen in
 KRAS
 -wt compared to
 KRAS
 -m tumors.
 Conclusions:
 KRAS
 -wt PDACs exhibited greater expression of cancer testis antigen genes compared to
 KRAS
 -m tumors, suggesting potential therapeutic susceptibility to immunotherapy and adoptive cell therapies leveraging the expression of CTAs as targets. Assessment of
 KRAS
 status and immunotherapy susceptibility may support future clinical trial selections for therapies targeting the complex interplay of genomic and immune components of pancreatic cancer.

 The loss of chromosome 16q is the single most common genomic event in BC, occurring in over 50% of tumors. Despite this, the literature is focused almost exclusively on the importance of focal mutations that show a maximum frequency of ∼35-40%. We have modeled 16q loss by deleted this region in mammary epithelium of genetically modified mice. This event was sufficient to induce mammary tumor formation. This finding establishes for the first time that 16q is a BC-suppressing chromosome arm. We have gone on to identify two genes on 16q that can promote tumor formation when one copy is lost (Cbfb and Ankrd11, each in cooperation with Pik3caHR). We have also identified mutations that cooperate with 16q syntenic sequence loss in spontaneous tumors from our 16q mouse model (c-Met gene amplification and p53 mutation) as well as in a Sleeping Beauty transposon-based screen (identifying mutations that enhance Ras and Rho signaling). Finally, we have used transcriptional profiling and proteomics to compare matching mammary tumors with/without 16q-syntenic sequence loss, which revealed that hemizygous deletion of this region suppressed keratinocyte-like differentiation in mammary tumors.

        <tr id="Unchecked growth in three-dimensions (3D) in culture is a key feature of immortalized cells on the path to malignant transformation and hence a potential target phenotype for prevention. Also, expression of genes driving this process, but not that of 2D growth, would likely be more specific to cancer development and their inhibition would be less toxic to normal cells, many of which can grow in 2D but rarely in 3D culture. To define such genes, we compared CRISPR depletion screens performed in HBLAK, a spontaneously immortalized, non-tumorigenic human urothelial cell line, grown in 2D to those in 3D. Using the CRISPR Bassik DTKP (drug target kinase phosphatase) deletion library targeting 2,333 genes, we identified 85 genes which were specifically lost in 3D cultures. Prioritizing hits to those associated with bladder cancer in patients provided us with a set of 11 genes. Only one gene, MAPK1 remained relevant if a human pan-cancer criteria was applied. Single gene in vitro validation confirmed that MAPK1 inhibition was specific to 3D growth. We also found that MAPK1 depletion led to significant growth reductions in human tumor xenografts in vivo. Inhibition of MAPK1 by Ulixertinib, an orally active MAPK1 inhibitor, led to human bladder cancer growth inhibition in both 3D in vitro and in vivo models. In summary, screening for genes specifically driving 3D growth in immortalized cells may provide targets for both prevention and early therapy in bladder and other cancers while potentially limiting therapeutic toxicity.">

        <tr id="The canonical DNA damage response (cDDR) maintains genome stability, involving DNA synthesis arrest. However, unchallenged cells proliferate when they are continually exposed to low-level/endogenous replication stress. We previously characterized a noncanonical response specific to nonblocking replication stress, i.e. low-level stress (LoL-DDR), in primary cells. Although LoL-DDR generates replication stress-induced ROS (RIR), it prevents the accumulation of premutagenic 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG). Primary cells control RIR production via NADPH oxidases. Increasing the severity of replication stress above a threshold triggers the cDDR, leading to cell cycle arrest and RIR suppression, resulting in a peak-shaped dose response for RIR production. Here, we show that the LoL-DDR is dysregulated in cancer cell lines, which exhibit the following differences compared with primary cells: (1) RIR are not detoxified under high-level stress, resulting in a continuous increase in the dose‒response curve of RIR production; (2) RIR are not produced by NADPH oxidases; (3) replication stress favors the accumulation of the premutagenic 8-oxoG. Moreover, using an in vitro breast cancer progression model, we show that LoL-DDR dysregulation occurs at an early stage of cancer progression. Since, conversely, ROS trigger replication stress this establishes a “vicious circle” replication-stress/ROS that continuously jeopardizes genome integrity that should fuel and amplify tumorigenesis.

        <tr id="Background Mutational signatures are increasingly used to understand the mechanisms causing cancer. However, their important applications in predicting prognosis and stratifying patients for therapy are hampered by inaccurate inference of the various featureless, dense trinucleotide mutational spectra, which are often confounded with one another. One of them is the homologous recombination deficiency (HRd)-associated signature SBS3, relevant because of its association with prognosis in ovarian and breast cancer and because of its potential as a biomarker for synthetic lethality therapies. Methods Here, we highlight strong benefits of a multimodal approach for mutational signature extraction, applied on top of standard bioinformatic pipelines. By jointly operating on single-base substitution (SBS) and indel (ID) spectra, this method enables accurate identification of various DNA repair deficiency signatures and patient survival prediction. Results Across four different cohorts of whole-genome sequenced high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC), the multimodal SBS + ID approach correctly distinguished the commonly confused signatures SBS3, SBS5, SBS8, SBS39, and SBS40. Importantly, we robustly identified two different multimodal SBS3 signatures, m-SBS3a and m-SBS3b, with distinct patterns in the indel spectrum. Multimodal SBS3b signature was strongly predictive of longer survival in ovarian cancer patients, replicating across four cohorts, with effect sizes greatly exceeding other genetic markers. Our m-SBS3 also predicted survival in platinum-treated patients with various cancer types, and moreover, the SBS + ID joint inference was successfully applied to mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer and immunotherapy response, supporting a general utility of the multimodal mutational signatures approach. Conclusions Overall, combining SBS and ID mutations improves detection of HR deficiency-associated signatures and reveals distinct SBS3 subtypes with prognostic value. This multimodal approach outperforms existing markers and is readily applicable to therapy stratification.

        <tr id="Despite the significant progress made in the development of epigenetic age (eAge) clocks designed to estimate the various aspects of aging, currently available models, generated using large DNA methylation microarray datasets, still cannot fully address the issues of batch effects and technical variation. This hinders the use of the publicly available eAge clocks in routine laboratory practice, and it motivates the development of cost-effective, custom epigenetic clocks that are tailored to the given biological subjects and research methods. In this study, we analyzed the local DNA methylation of mesenchymal stem cell samples during culture expansion using high-throughput targeted bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq). Using the obtained data, we trained a minimized eAge model based on a Random Forest Regression with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation, which determines cell passage with good performance (MAE 1.094 and R2 0.897) and which is comparable to previous solutions. Using the advantage of BS-seq to analyze consecutive CpGs methylation patterns, we demonstrated that combining the analysis of average DNA methylation levels with local methylation heterogeneity scores—thereby reflecting stochastic DNA methylation dynamics—can improve the quality of the epigenetic clock models. Therefore, we propose a research strategy for creating customized epigenetic clocks using targeted BS-seq and provide a mechanistic conceptualization of how information on longitudinal changes in DNA methylation patterns can potentially be used for the assessment of specific aging aspects.">

        <tr id="Background Cetuximab resistance severely restricts its effectiveness in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Previous studies have predominantly focused on the genetic level, with scant attention to the nongenetic aspects. This study aimed to identify the crucial microRNA (miRNA) that is responsible for cetuximab resistance. Methods Key miRNAs were identified using small RNA sequencing analysis. miR-196b’s role and mechanism in cetuximab resistance was explored by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Clinical blood samples were dynamically analyzed using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess the predictive value of miR-196b for efficacy. Results We initially discovered that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway was progressively activated during the acquisition of cetuximab resistance in CRC cells. Further study determined that miR-196b can inhibit the activity of ERK and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways by downregulating both NRAS and BRAF, which can kill two birds with one stone, thus enhancing the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to cetuximab. The expression of miR-196b was found to be significantly downregulated in both cetuximab-resistant cells and the tumor tissues of patients exhibiting resistance. In the presence of cetuximab, overexpression of miR-196b further inhibited the proliferation and migration and promoted the apoptosis of CRC cells, while miR-196b silencing had the opposite effects. Importantly, analysis of clinical blood samples confirmed that miR-196b can serve as a predictive and dynamic biomarker for monitoring the outcomes of patients with CRC treated with cetuximab. Conclusions This study supports that activation of the ERK signaling pathway is a key factor in cetuximab resistance. In addition, miR-196b can modulate and predict the CRC response to cetuximab, holding broad potential applications.

        <tr id="Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent malignant hematologic disease characterized by the abnormal proliferation and accumulation of immature lymphocytes in bone marrow and lymphoid tissues. In our study, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing was performed to investigate four types of methylation modifications—6 mA, CHG, CHH, and CpG—in a pair of monozygotic twins, where one twin has ALL and the other is healthy. The results showed the significant global hypomethylation of CpG sites and an increase in 6 mA, CHG, and CHH methylation in the twin diagnosed with ALL. Notably, the hypomethylation of CpG was particularly increased in the open sea, gene body, and 3'UTR regions, while 6 mA and CHG modifications exhibited high methylation levels in the gene body, TSS1500, TSS200, and 3'UTR regions. Additionally, CHH modifications showed high methylation across all genomic regions. Within the differential methylation loci (DML), we identified several genes related to tumorigenesis and progression (such as ZDHHC11, NBPF1, and TPTE). Furthermore, we systemically reviewed the literatures on leukemia and DNA methylation modifications, providing a comprehensive description of their correlation. In summary, these findings indicate that DNA methylation plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of ALL, offering valuable insights for future research into its impact on leukemia development.

        <tr id="Mutational signatures of single-base substitutions (SBSs) characterize somatic mutation processes which contribute to cancer development and progression. However, current mutational signatures do not distinguish the two independent steps that generate SBSs: the initial DNA damage followed by erroneous repair. To address this modelling gap we developed DAMUTA, a hierarchical Bayesian probabilistic model that infers separate signatures for each process, and captures their sample-specific interaction. We applied DAMUTA to 18,974 pan-cancer whole genome sequencing mutation catalogues from 23 cancer types and show that tissue-specificity in mutation patterns is driven largely by variability in damage processes. We also show that misrepair processes are predictive of DNA damage response deficiencies. Unlike existing approaches, DAMUTA distinguishes damage from misrepair contributions, and we demonstrate significant improvements over a mutational-burden baseline or signatures from the COSMIC database. Our analysis reveals a shared pan-cancer pattern of early clonal transition-mutations which shifts to a more uniform substitution pattern consistent with increased reliance on translesion synthesis for damage tolerance. DAMUTA thus generates a compact set of signatures which resolves redundancies of current signature models, disentangles the effects of DNA damage and misrepair processes, and facilitates improved stratification of tumours, while providing a framework towards a unified pan-cancer model of the cellular response to DNA damage.">

 Background: Patients exhibiting exceptional response to targeted treatments represent a unique opportunity towards identifying predictive biomarkers of response. The introduction of edits into the genome using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) creates cancer models that can unravel the mechanisms driving tumorigenesis and response to drug agents. The study aimed to identify candidate molecular alterations associated with exceptional response to CDK inhibitors (CDKi) and validate their effects using genome editing. Methods: Patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer treated with CDKi and endocrine combination therapy at Departments of Oncology-affiliated with the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG), were included. Exceptional response was defined as either complete response (CR) to the treatment regimen or partial response (PR) for 3 years, per physician’s assessment. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue samples, obtained prior to CDKi administration from these patients were retrospectively collected. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to analyze tumor mutational landscape of exceptional responders to CDKi. Using CRISPR-mediated genome editing, a breast cancer cell model harboring a patient-specific SNP and the negative control were prepared, and subsequently evaluated for their responsiveness to palbociclib. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were conducted to uncover alterations in network interactions, between the two cell lines, elucidating the exceptional response to CDKi. Results: Overall, 12 women identified as exceptional responders, initiated CDKi treatment from March 2017 to February 2020; median age at diagnosis was 46 (range, 37 to 78). All patients had received the CDKi as first-line treatment; most commonly palbociclib (10 patients, 83.3%). Based on physician assessment, 50% of patients achieved CR with the combination therapy. After a median follow up of 65 months, 10 patients are still alive, and 7 are still receiving treatment with CDKi in combination with endocrine treatment. WES results with adequate mapped reads and acceptable technical characteristics in both tumor and control blood samples were obtained from 6 of 12 patients. A set of germline and somatic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) commonly shared in this cohort was identified. The focus was on MINDY1, a member of the MINDY family of deubiquitinases (DUBs), known as a deubiquitylase of ERα in breast cancer, the common SNP among all 6 patients. Utilizing CRISPR-based genome editing, a breast cancer cell model harboring a specific MINDY1 SNP was engineered, and their response to palbociclib was subsequently evaluated. Depletion of MINDY1 transcripts through RNA interference with short-hairpin RNA, increased sensitivity to palbociclib in both cell lines, confirming that MINDY1 protein is involved in molecular pathways related to palbociclib response. The functional role of MINDY1 rs771205 was also investigated by combining transcriptomic and proteomic data. Our data demonstrated that the MINDY1 rs771205 SNP, which causes an amino acid substitution, while it does not impact the respective transcript and protein levels, alters the MINDY1 protein’s interaction network. Conclusions: The Rs771205 single mutation alters the MINDY1 protein’s interaction network, sensitizing cells to palbociclib. Our study sheds new light on the underlying mechanisms driving exceptional response in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer treated with CDKi and endocrine combination therapy , demonstrating that it is an opportune moment to invest attention and resources towards probing the underlying mechanisms of exceptional response in cancer patients.

        <tr id="Bladder cancer (BC) displays a huge phenotypic variation and widespread clinical outcomes, attributed to the high mutational heterogeneity of the disease. Mutational landscaping became integral to cancer patient management as it unveils driver genes and yields genotype–phenotype associations. This study aims to identify somatic mutations, their frequencies and their associations with clinical and prognostic outcomes in BC. Eighty-one BC patients were analyzed by next-generation sequencing using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspots Panel v2. Bioinformatics analysis, correlation studies and Kaplan–Meier curve were used to evaluate the relationship between genes’ mutational status and patients’ clinical parameters and outcomes. Our results indicated that the BC cohort exhibited a higher mutation burden than the TCGA data. Mutations were identified in 46 out of 50 genes, including 21 novel mutations not previously reported in BC. The TP53 gene was mutated in 82.5% of the analyzed cohort, followed by PIK3 CA (45%), FGFR3 (43.75%) and APC (35%). TP53 mutations were associated with poor survival (p = 0.003) while the FGFR3 mutation group exhibited signs of good prognosis (p = 0.018). Bioinformatics highlighted significant gene interactions associated with poor prognosis. These findings underline the importance of identifying novel genetic mutations that could significantly improve prognostic stratification and expand therapeutic options for managing BC patients.">

        <tr id="Tumor protein p53 (TP53) is a crucial regulator of genomic integrity, frequently mutated in more than half of all human cancers. These mutations predominantly target the DNA-binding domain (DBD), impairing p53's interaction with DNA and its tumor-suppressive functions. To elucidate the structural and functional consequences of p53 mutations, we investigated 148 missense variants located within its DNA-binding interface using cutting-edge computational approaches. We employed AlphaFold3 (AF3) to predict p53-DNA complex structures, integrating these predictions with molecular dynamics (MD) and force-guided pulling simulations to assess mutation-induced changes in structural stability and DNA-binding properties. Moreover, we compared the results of our study with experimental in vitro enrichment scores (RFS) and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD). We identified a moderate negative correlation between plDDT and the pathogenicity of mutant variants, suggesting that mutations causing more significant alterations in the protein tertiary structure have a greater negative impact on cellular function. Moreover, we identified two possible structural mechanisms through which mutations can impair the p53 functionality. Specifically, some mutations, such as R248P and N239S, reduce the binding affinity of the p53-DNA complex, whereas others, such as C238Y and P278R, enhance affinity but compromise the structural stability of the complex. Furthermore, we uncovered mutations with potential rescuing effects, such as E285A and M243T, which preserved structural stability and enhanced the DNA-binding ability. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying p53 mutations and their role in cancer pathogenesis. This study highlights the value of integrative computational approaches in investigating protein-nucleic acid interactions, providing critical insights that can guide the development of therapeutic strategies targeting p53 mutations.">

        <tr id="CHROMR is a primate-specific long noncoding RNA with emerging roles in homeostasis and pathophysiology. Elevated blood levels of CHROMR have been observed in patients with cardiovascular disease and several cancers, where it is correlated with poor clinical outcomes. Like many lncRNAs, CHROMR accumulates in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and it assumes distinct functions in each of these cellular compartments. In the nucleus, CHROMR sequesters a transcriptional repressor complex to activate interferon-stimulated gene expression and antiviral immunity. In the cytoplasm, CHROMR competitively inhibits microRNAs involved in cholesterol efflux and cell cycle regulation, thereby impacting gene pathways involved in reverse cholesterol transport, HDL biogenesis, and tumor growth. In this review, we detail the multifaceted functions of CHROMR in cholesterol metabolism, innate immunity, and cancer progression. We also explore the potential molecular mechanisms that govern its expression and dynamic subcellular localization, which may be key to its functional versatility. Advancing our understanding of the regulatory networks and cellular environments that shape CHROMR activity will be critical for assessing its promise as a therapeutic target and diagnostic biomarker.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE AlphaMissense is a new artificial intelligence–based approach to predicting the pathogenicity of missense variants. However, whether its predictions can be directly applied to clinical decision making remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of AlphaMissense predictions for DNA damage repair (DDR) genes using genomic and clinical characteristics. METHODS Sequencing data from 56,965 patients with cancer who underwent Memorial Sloan Kettering–Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) testing between April 2015 and March 2023 and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)/Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) were analyzed. AlphaMissense pathogenicity was evaluated in six commonly mutated DDR genes. Missense mutations were classified into three categories on the basis of AlphaMissense and OncoKB: known pathogenic, newly identified pathogenic by AlphaMissense, or benign. RESULTS In the MSK-IMPACT cohort, 1,182 (17.5%) of 6,743 unique DDR gene missense mutations were newly identified as pathogenic. In breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, homologous recombination (HR)–deficiency signatures were more common in tumors with new pathogenic missense mutations in BRCA1/2, PALB2, and RAD51C than in benign missense mutations (66.7% v 35.2%, P = .021). In the TCGA/PCAWG data set, HR-deficiency signatures were also more frequent in tumors with new pathogenic mutations than in wild-type (46.2% v 19.2%, P = .036). For tumors with POLE missense mutations, there were no significant differences in tumor mutation burden and POLE-associated signatures between new pathogenic and benign mutations. Patients with new pathogenic ATM missense mutations had fewer TP53 mutations (30.5% v 54.6%, P < .001) and showed improved irradiated tumor control (hazard ratio, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.95]; P = .03) compared with those with benign missense mutations. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that AlphaMissense can help identify previously unknown pathogenic DDR gene mutations, but its accuracy is gene-dependent. AlphaMissense prediction still requires additional confirmation with clinical and functional validation.">

 Background:
 Epigenetic dysregulation is a key mechanism in cancer biology, driving both immune evasion and the generation of potentially druggable neoantigen targets. Transposable elements (TEs) are proviral sequences mostly found in epigenetically repressed genomic regions. In cancer, TEs are one potential source of neoantigens. The tumor suppressor gene
 ATRX
 is an epigenetic regulator that is lost in up to 30% of soft tissue sarcomas. Loss of function of this heterochromatin modulator leads to widespread alterations to transcription patterns. Our prior work in sarcoma, along with studies in other tumors, showed that ATRX loss leads to the de-repression of TEs. We hypothesize that this mechanism leads to TE neoantigen presentation on MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules.
 Methods:
 Leveraging the gEVE database of proviral sequences with open reading frames, we examined the differential expression of TEs using RNA sequencing of multiple models comparing ATRX lost and ATRX wild-type tumors. Analysis included our previously published data from human undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma cell lines (2 clones, 3 replicates per group; GEO: GSE240030) and a publicly available dataset from a mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma (n = 3 per group; GEO: GSE167537). Additionally, we analyzed analogous data from a mouse model of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), another malignancy with frequent ATRX loss (n = 3 per group; GEO: GSE178113). RNA-seq data was analyzed using Salmon for transcript-to-genome pseudo-alignment, DESeq2 for differential TE expression analysis, and arcasHLA for sample-level MHC-I subtype identification. Differentially overexpressed TEs in ATRX mutant tumors were analyzed for predicted neoantigens using the NetMHCpan4.1 package.
 Results:
 Across multiple models, ATRX loss of function alterations were associated with both activation and repression of TEs. Within two sarcoma contexts, upregulated TEs were found to have protein-coding sequences with the potential to lead to MHC-I neoantigen presentation. Within a human undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma cell line with ATRX loss, there were 7 upregulated TEs shared between the clones, each predicted to contain 12 – 50 MHC-I binding epitopes. Within a mouse soft tissue sarcoma model, 7 TEs were upregulated with ATRX loss, each with 5 – 28 MHC-I binding epitopes. Since ATRX loss alters TE expression in other malignancies, parallel data from a mouse GBM model was additionally analyzed. In this model, 308 TEs were found to be upregulated with ATRX loss, and all were predicted to generate neoantigens. ERVs and LINE1 elements were recurrently identified, making up 97 – 100% of the activated TEs.
 Conclusions:
 Transposable element transcription altered by ATRX loss in sarcoma and GBM creates a predicted source of MHC-I-binding neoantigens. These neoantigens come from TEs of the ERV and LINE1 families.

        <tr id="Significance Here, we address a major limitation in the effectiveness of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in breast cancer gene (BRCA)-mutant prostate cancer treatment: Only ~50% of patients respond despite clear genomic evidence of defective homologous recombination. Prior efforts to study PARPi resistance in prostate cancer have been plagued by the lack of suitable cell lines. We overcame this challenge using primary prostate organoids coupled with genome-wide CRISPR screening. The key finding is that loss-of-function mutations in the DNA prereplication complex (pre-RC) confer PARPi resistance. These genes map to chromosomal regions frequently lost in prostate cancer and could therefore serve as potential biomarkers of treatment response. Pharmacologic inhibition of geminin, a negative regulator of the pre-RC, can restore PARPi sensitivity.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease where oxidative stress and DNA damage may influence disease progression. We investigated whether defects in base excision repair (BER) pathways contribute to MS by combining functional DNA repair assays, gene expression profiling, and genotype analysis. We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 70 MS patients and 61 healthy controls. These cells were subjected to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH)-induced oxidative stress, and comet assay kinetics were measured over a period of 60 min. Additionally, we quantified the mRNA expression of nine key BER genes and genotyped selected polymorphisms related to DNA repair capacity. Samples from MS patients exhibited significantly higher levels of TBH-induced DNA lesions and displayed a distinct repair trajectory over time, as indicated by area-under-the-curve (AUC) analyses (p < 0.001). The transcripts of MBD4 and NTHL1 were notably reduced in MS patients compared to those in the controls (p < 0.0001). A logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the specific BER-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs3087404, rs4135054, and rs1052133 and ineffective DNA repair. Subset analyses of B cells, CD4+ cells, and CD8+ cells further supported the presence of altered repair kinetics in MS, even though some subsets exhibited similar baseline lesion levels. Our findings suggest that impaired oxidative DNA repair is present in MS, likely driven by functional deficits in repair kinetics and alterations in the expression of BER genes and polymorphisms. This integrated approach highlights DNA repair pathways as potential therapeutic or prognostic targets in MS.">

 Cellular reprogramming is a fundamental process in specific developmental stages and is also invaluable for disease modeling. It involves the conversion of differentiated cells into undifferentiated or specialized cell types. This transformation relies on coordinated action of transcription factors or chemical stimuli, which reshapes the cell's chromatin structure and establishes a different gene expression profile. Among these transcription factors, pioneer factors play a critical role, initiating cellular reprogramming and guiding cell fate transitions by selectively binding to specific DNA motifs within nucleosomes at inactive chromatin. The GATA3 protein serves as a pioneer transcription factor essential in mammary gland development and is involved in breast tumor development. GATA3 facilitates the cellular reprogramming of mesenchymal breast cancer cells into epithelial breast cancer cells. Despite the established role of pioneer factors in chromatin remodeling and cell fate regulation, the precise molecular mechanisms that govern their selective binding to chromatin are still not fully understood. Using the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) model, we aimed to understand how GATA3 selectively binds to genes that are essential for successful cellular reprogramming. Utilizing a combination of machine learning and experimental approaches, we investigated GATA3's binding affinity to DNA and nucleosome substrates. Machine learning analysis identified two distinct zinc-finger domains which are required for effective GATA3 nucleosome binding. The results of this deep learning analysis were used to design a series of GATA3 mutant cell lines and DNA substrates. The experimental approach involved two strategies: first, analyzing the binding affinity of wild-type GATA3 to DNA substrates designed based on machine learning predictions, and second, examining the nucleosome binding affinity of GATA3 mutants, including those predicted by computational modeling and those derived from breast cancer patients. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the differential binding affinities of GATA3 mutants, indicating the importance of specific motifs and zinc finger domains. Our findings highlight the significance of DNA sequence specificity in modulating pioneer transcription factor activity and chromatin accessibility. Mutational analysis revealed distinct roles for each zinc finger domain, with mutations affecting DNA binding affinity and chromatin accessibility. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms governing GATA3-mediated chromatin remodeling during MET. By characterizing the interaction between DNA/nucleosome binding affinity and chromatin accessibility, we expand our understanding of pioneer transcription factor function in breast cancer progression.

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is recognized for its aggressiveness, yet the mechanism underlying metastasis remains unclear. Here, we report that CREPT/RPRD1B, which exhibits somatic gene copy-number amplifications and elevated expression, correlates with poor patient survival and drives TNBC metastasis. We demonstrate that CREPT alters three-dimensional genome structures in topologically-associating domain (TAD) status and chromatin loops via occupying promoters and enhancers. Specifically, CREPT mediates 1082 co-operational chromatin loops configured by enhancer-promoter and promoter-termination loops, which are validated by HiChIP analyses and visualized by Tn5-FISH experiments. These loops orchestrate RNAPII loading and recycling to enhance the metastatic gene expression. Disruption of these co-operational loops using CRISPR-dCas9 suppresses TNBC metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, depletion of CREPT using an AAV-based shRNA blocks TNBC metastasis in both preventative and therapeutic mouse models. We propose that targeting CREPT to disrupt the co-operational chromatin loop structures represents a promising therapeutic strategy for metastatic TNBC.

        <tr id="Understanding how the assembly of nascent mRNA into a ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) influences R-loop homeostasis is crucial for gaining insight into the cellular mechanisms that prevent genome instability. Here, we identify three RNA-binding proteins, Rie1, Rim4 and She2, whose expression levels are important to limit R-loop accumulation and, thus, to prevent DNA damage. Interestingly, Rim4 and She2 are overrepresented in CBP80-containing mRNPs formed in the absence of THO. In addition, we found that an excess of the RNA exosome component Dis3 impairs its function, promoting R-loops, particularly from non-coding RNAs, which cause genomic instability. Our results indicate that changes in the availability of different RBPs or RNAs, causes R-loop-mediated DNA damage in the cell. These results may help to understand the mechanism that promotes cancer, as several RBPs are overexpressed in different types of tumors.">

        <tr id="A histological evaluation remains the cornerstone of diagnosing highly malignant osteosarcoma, having demonstrated its efficacy and reliability over several decades. However, despite these advancements, misdiagnoses with severe consequences, including inadequate surgical procedures, continue to occur. Consequently, there is a pressing need to further enhance diagnostic security. Adjunct immunohistochemical approaches have demonstrated significant effectiveness in regard to cancer diagnostics, generally. However, their utility for identifying highly malignant osteosarcoma is limited. Molecular genetic findings have significantly improved the diagnosis of Ewing’s sarcoma by identifying specific translocations and have been used to detect specific IDH gene mutations in chondrosarcoma. Nevertheless, molecular genetic alterations in highly malignant osteosarcoma exhibit a high degree of complexity, thereby limiting their diagnostic utility. Given that only 1–2% of the human genome comprises protein-coding sequences, the growing number of non-coding regulatory RNAs, which are increasingly being elucidated, has garnered substantial attention in the field of clinical cancer diagnostics. Over the past several years, patterns of altered non-coding RNA expression have been identified that facilitate the distinction between benign and malignant tumors in various organs. In the field of bone tumors, the experience of this approach has been limited thus far. The divergent expression of microRNAs has demonstrated utility for differentiating osteosarcoma from osteoblastoma and discriminating between osteosarcoma and giant-cell tumors of bone and fibrous dysplasia. However, the application of non-coding RNA expression patterns for the differential diagnosis of osteosarcoma is still in its preliminary stages. This review provides an overview of the current status of non-coding RNAs in osteosarcoma diagnostics, in conjunction with a histological evaluation. The potential of this approach is discussed comprehensively.">

            <jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold>
            Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) is essential for identifying actionable and prognostic biomarkers in oncology practice. This study investigates oncogenic alterations, key driver mutations, and co-mutation patterns in Indian cancer patients. By targeting hallmark pathways driving disease progression, it highlights the potential of combinatorial therapies over single-biomarker approaches to address cancer's complex evolution.
            <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold>
            A retrospective analysis was conducted on FFPE tumor samples from 3,740 Indian cancer patients across 37 malignancies. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with whole exome sequencing and a custom-designed "Functional Cancer Exome" panel targeting 1,212 cancer-related genes. Variants were annotated using multiple databases, with functional and co-mutation analyses providing key insights into oncogenic mechanisms and mutation patterns.
            <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>
            A standard variant filtration strategy identified 2,795 pathogenic mutations, focusing on clinically relevant alterations across cancer types. The analysis highlights the prevalence of pathogenic mutations in 1075 pivotal genes, with
            <jats:italic toggle="yes">TP53</jats:italic>
            (34.8%),
            <jats:italic toggle="yes">KRAS</jats:italic>
            (15.3%), and
            <jats:italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</jats:italic>
            (10.3%) being most prevalent. When unique genes identified in this study were mapped onto hallmark pathways associated with cancer etiology, we arrived at 13 genes(
            <jats:italic toggle="yes">MYC, IDH1, SOD1, CD36, EGFR,</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic toggle="yes">GCH1</jats:italic>
            among others) that drive cross-talk across at least five distinct pathways, acting as master regulators of disease progression. We also looked at the functional categories of co-mutated genes compared with hallmark properties in table 1.
            <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold>
            One biomarker/gene and one drug combination may not work during disease evolution. The hub genes identified emphasize the need for combinatorial therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways to disrupt crosstalk driving disease progression. Future research trials integrating clinical validation will be essential to translate these therapeutic insights into effective personalized treatments.

        <tr id="PIK3CA and KRAS are among the most frequently mutated oncogenes and often co-mutated in colorectal cancers. Understanding how KRAS codon-specific mutations affect cross-talks between the PI3K and MAPK pathways and response to targeted therapies, such as the p110α-specific inhibitor inavolisib (GDC-0077), is critical for advancing precision oncology. Focusing on colorectal PIK3CA+KRAS co-mutated models, we found that KRAS G12D-mutated cells were more sensitive to inavolisib than models with KRAS G13D, or other MAPK pathway mutations, even though the PI3K and MAPK pathways were active in both genotypes. In most co-mutated models, regardless of the type of KRAS alteration, combination of inavolisib with MAPK pathway inhibitors showed synergy in vitro and in vivo. Our work highlights how specific codon substitutions in KRAS differentially toggle pathway activity and alter sensitivity to inavolisib, which could inform whether patients would benefit more from single-agent inavolisib or combination with MAPK pathway inhibitors.">
