        <tr id="DHFR gene amplification is commonly present in methotrexate (MTX)-resistant colon cancer cells and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, we proposed an integrative framework to characterize the amplified region by using a combination of single-molecule real-time sequencing, next-generation optical mapping, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C). We identified an amplification unit spanning 11 genes, from the DHFR gene to the ATP6AP1L gene position, with high adjusted interaction frequencies on chromosome 5 (~2.2 Mbp) and a twenty-fold tandemly amplified region, and novel inversions at the start and end positions of the amplified region as well as frameshift insertions in most of the MSH and MLH genes were detected. These mutations might stimulate chromosomal breakage and cause the dysregulation of mismatch repair. Characterizing the tandem gene-amplified unit may be critical for identifying the mechanisms that trigger genomic rearrangements. These findings may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the amplification process and the evolution of drug resistance. Sequencing a large region of DNA containing many surplus copies of genes linked to drug resistance in colon cancer cells may illuminate how these genomic rearrangements arise. Such regions of gene amplification are highly repetitive, making them impossible to sequence using ordinary methods, and little is known about how they are generated. Using advanced methods, Jeong-Sun Seo at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital in South Korea and co-workers sequenced a region of gene amplification in colon cancer cells. The amplified region was approximately 20 times the length of that in healthy cells and contained many copies of an eleven-gene segment, including a gene implicated in drug resistance. The region also contained mutations in chromosomal repair genes which would disrupt repair pathways. These results illuminate the genetic changes that lead to gene amplification and drug resistance in cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Cancer drug resistance is multi-factorial, driven by heritable (epi)genetic changes but also phenotypic plasticity. Here, we dissected drivers of resistance by perturbing colorectal cancer patient-derived organoids longitudinally with drugs in sequence. Combined longitudinal lineage tracking, single cell multi-omics analysis, evolutionary modelling, and machine learning revealed that different targeted drugs select for distinct subclones, supporting rationally designed drug sequences. The cellular memory of drug resistance was encoded as a heritable epigenetic configuration from which multiple transcriptional programs could run, supporting a one-to-many (epi)genotype-to-phenotype map that explains how clonal expansions and plasticity manifest together. This epigenetic landscape may ensure drug resistant subclones can exhibit distinct phenotypes in changing environments while still preserving the cellular memory encoding for their selective advantage. Chemotherapy resistance was instead entirely driven by transient phenotypic plasticity rather than stable clonal selection. Inducing further chromosomal instability before drug application changed clonal evolution but not convergent transcriptional programs. Collectively, these data show how genetic and epigenetic alterations are selected to engender a "permissive epigenome" that enables phenotypic plasticity.">

        <tr id="Cancer cells that survive therapeutic drug pressure are a significant cause of disease relapse and progression, impeding curative cancer treatment. Drug-triggered Darwinian selection and the emergence of subclones harbouring specific mutations that confer resistance have been well documented and extensively studied. However, these genetic alterations, while important, do not fully explain clinical observations where some patients, after a drug holiday, regain sensitivity to the same treatment despite previous disease progression. This phenomenon highlights the possibility that drug resistance may not solely rely on genetic mutations but could also involve reversible, non-genetic mechanisms. Recent studies have highlighted the existence of drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs), a subpopulation of cancer cells that can survive short-term therapeutic pressure without acquiring resistance-associated genetic alterations. These cells exhibit a temporary yet reversible tolerance to the initial treatment while also acquiring cross-tolerance to other anti-cancer therapies. The presence of DTPs underscores a dynamic and complex plasticity in tumours, wherein cancer cells can utilise epigenetic rewiring, metabolic reprogramming, and specific signalling pathways to transit between drug-tolerant and drug-sensitive states to adapt to environmental pressures. Furthermore, this adaptive resilience enables DTPs to act as a reservoir for the development of genetically stable resistance, resulting in cancer therapy failure and eventual relapse. In this mini-review, we examine recent evidence on DTPs to provide an overview of their characteristics, development, and survival mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Karyotyping, SNP arrays, fluorescence in situ hybridisation and next generation sequencing techniques have greatly improved our understanding of the genetic drivers of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the past years, another layer of genetic data has been added by the study of mutational signatures, patterns of somatic mutations that represent specific mutational mechanisms. Mutational signatures can give insight in tumor development, but also reveal mutagenic side-effects of treatment in relapse samples. Multiple treatment-related mutational signatures have been detected in relapsed ALL that could play a role in therapy resistance and relapse development. In fact, multiple pathogenic driver mutations have been attributed to these treatment-related mutational processes, including a recurrent TP53 mutation. Studies in childhood ALL revealed that thiopurine exposure is the most common source of therapy-related mutagenicity in ALL and presents differently when patients are DNA mismatch repair deficient. Thiopurine-induced DNA damage indicates that leukemic cells were able to survive thiopurine exposure. This could be due to metabolic defects, acquired mutations that induce thiopurine resistance during treatment or resistance to drugs synergizing with thiopurines. In this review, we discuss the types and prevalence of treatment-related mutational signatures in ALL, and explore mechanisms of thiopurine cytotoxicity and mutagenicity.">

        <tr id="Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has dramatically transformed the treatment landscape for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. However, the long-term success of this therapy is often compromised by the onset of acquired resistance, with non-genetic mechanisms increasingly recognized as pivotal contributors. Here, we exploit a multi-omics approach to profile genome-wide chromatin accessibility and transcriptional landscapes between drug sensitive and resistant EGFR-mutant cells. Our findings reveal a robust concordance between epigenetic regulome and transcriptomic changes that characterize the osimertinib resistant state. Through CRISPR-based functional genomics screen targeting epigenetic regulators and transcription factors, we uncover a critical regulatory network featuring key members of the NuRD and PRC2 complexes that mediate resistance. Most critically, our screen identifies FOSL1 and JUN, two subunits of the AP-1 transcription factor within this network, as the most significant hits. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that cis-regulatory elements exhibiting altered chromatin accessibility in the resistant state are enriched for cognate AP-1 binding motifs, enabling AP-1 to orchestrate a gene expression program that underpins the druggable MEK/ERK signaling axis, potentially enhancing cell viability and fitness of resistant cells. Importantly, genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of AP-1 reinstates cellular and molecular sensitivity, and reverts resistance-associated phenotypes, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, upon anti-EGFR rechallenge by repressing AKT and ERK signaling. These findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic and transcriptional control of osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, highlighting AP-1 as a targetable vulnerability of resistance-related hallmarks and offering a promising avenue for developing resistance reversal strategies.">

        <tr id="Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a promising oncolytic agent with a non-segmented, negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of approximately 15 kb. While NDV selectively replicates in and lyses a wide range of human cancer cells, a subset of these cells develop persistent infections, potentially compromising the therapeutic efficacy of NDV-based treatments. To investigate the molecular basis of persistent infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of TCCSUP bladder cancer cells persistently infected with the NDV AF2240 strain. Deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 was conducted in triplicate, and the resulting viral and host reads were separated and analyzed. Using Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV) software, we identified several nucleotide variants linked to persistence. Specifically, nucleotide alterations included a deletion at 359A→C and a substitution at 1653C→T within the nucleoprotein (NP) gene, as well as an insertion at 3338C→T in the matrix protein (M) gene. Additionally, a GGG base insertion was detected at position 2290 in the phosphoprotein (P) gene. Crucially, we observed truncations in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene (nt 8263–8390) and the large polymerase (L) gene (nt 6203–6342). These mutations and truncations suggest significant disruptions in viral replication, assembly, and host cell attachment, potentially facilitating viral persistence in bladder cancer cells. Understanding these genomic alterations provides valuable insights into the mechanisms driving viral persistence and could inform strategies to optimize the oncolytic efficacy of NDV in cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most common malignancy in young men, exhibit a unique developmental origin and exceptional chemosensitivity. However, the molecular distinctions between TGCT subtypes remain poorly understood. Here we present a comprehensive genomic analysis of 252 treatment-naive primary TGCTs, integrating deep whole-genome sequencing with matched transcriptomic and epigenomic data. We identify new driver genes and uncover defining features of TGCTs, including pervasive chromosome X amplification with subtype-specific X chromosome inactivation, and a germ cell-like transcriptional program. Although previously reported, whole genome doubling (WGD) in TGCTs is further characterized here as ubiquitous, developmentally early, and associated with age at onset. Seminomas are enriched for early driver mutations, secondary WGD events, sustained XIST expression and replication stress-associated indel mutational signatures, while non-seminomas show greater structural complexity, subclonal diversity, relatively earlier-onset WGD, extended tumor latency, and telomere elongation. Moreover, we identify a mutational signature, SBS87, that is exceptionally rare across cancers with exception of thiopurine-treated leukemia, but strikingly prevalent in TGCT, especially non-seminomas. SBS87 is linked to extended tumor latency and telomere elongation, implicating possible environmental or endogenous processes that mimic thiopurine-induced DNA damage in TGCT pathogenesis. Collectively, our findings define TGCTs as molecularly distinct tumors shaped by early genomic instability and highlight SBS87 as a novel mutational footprint with potential etiologic and clinical relevance.">

        <tr id="Anticancer chemotherapy is an essential part of cancer treatment, but the emergence of resistance remains a major hurdle. Metabolic reprogramming is a notable phenotype associated with the acquisition of drug resistance. Here, we develop a computational framework that predicts metabolic gene targets capable of reverting the metabolic state of drug-resistant cells to that of drug-sensitive parental cells, thereby sensitizing the resistant cells. The computational framework performs single-gene knockout simulation of genome-scale metabolic models that predicts genome-wide metabolic flux distribution in drug-resistant cells, and clusters the resulting knockout flux data using uniform manifold approximation and projection, followed by k-means clustering. From the clustering analysis, knockout genes that lead to the flux data near that of drug-sensitive cells are considered drug sensitization targets. This computational approach is demonstrated using doxorubicin- and paclitaxel-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells. Drug sensitization targets are further refined based on proteome and metabolome data, which generate GOT1 for doxorubicin-resistant MCF7, GPI for paclitaxel-resistant MCF7, and SLC1A5 as a common target. These targets are experimentally validated where treating drug-resistant cancer cells with small-molecule inhibitors results in increased sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to doxorubicin or paclitaxel. The applicability of the developed framework is further demonstrated using drug-resistant triple-negative breast cancer cells. Taken together, the computational framework predicts drug sensitization targets in an intuitive and cost-efficient manner and can be applied to overcome drug-resistant cells associated with various cancers and other metabolic diseases.">

However, such studies are mostly type-specific, and capturing shared genomic abnormalities responsible for neoplastic transformation and progression is a challenging task. Pan-cancer analysis offers insights into the shared and unique molecular mechanisms driving cancer. We conducted an integrated gene-expression analysis using 10,629 samples from 30 distinct cancer types characterized by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A gene co-expression network was constructed and genes overlapping between the selected modules and Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were designated as genes of interest. Following a comprehensive literature review, ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 10 (ABCA10) and ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5) were selected as key candidates for downstream analysis due to the absence of systematic pan-cancer analysis of these genes. This study presents a unique contribution as the first comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of ABCA10 and ABCB5, highlighting their roles in tumor biology and clinical outcomes. We employed a variety of bioinformatics tools to explore the role of these genes across different tumors. Our research demonstrated that ABCA10 shows reduced expression, while ABCB5 displays variable expression patterns across tumors, indicating their opposing roles and flexible functions in pan-cancer. In many cancer patients, these expression patterns are correlated with worse survival outcomes. Furthermore, immunotherapy responses and immune infiltration across a variety of tumor types are associated with the expression levels of both ABCA10 and ABCB5. These results imply that ABCA10 and ABCB5 could serve as valuable predictive markers and potential therapeutic targets across various cancers.">

Loss of misp53R273H/C decreased tumor growth and liver metastasis while prolonging survival in preclinical models. We found that misp53R273H/C specifically regulated the Rb/DREAM axis involved in cell cycle regulation. Notably, a clinical CDK4/6 inhibitor reduced misp53R273H/C mutant expression. However, it triggered MAPK/ERK-mediated resistance mechanisms, enhancing cell survival and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Combining MAPK/ERK and CDK4/6 inhibitors reduced misp53R273H/C-associated oncogenic functions. Thus, distinct misp53 mutants show unique cell-intrinsic plasticity, therapeutic vulnerabilities, and resistance mechanisms.">

 Background:
 Despite advances in therapies, the development of drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) poses a significant challenge. The emergence of neoantigen-based therapies offer a promising new frontier which enhances treatment efficacy and reduces associated costs.
 Methods:
 A total of 24 patients diagnosed with NSCLC were enrolled in this study. Primary tumor tissues and peripheral blood samples were collected from each patient. Paired whole exome and transcriptomic sequencing data were performed to identify somatic mutations and to quantify their respective expression levels. Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions or deletions (inDels) were detected using Strelka algorithm from whole exome sequencing (WES) data. Neoantigen prediction focused on human leukocyte antigens (HLA) type 1. HLA alleles were predicted using WES data encoding adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples, identifying four alleles that were present in at least 50% of the patients. Neoantigens were considered potentially immunogenic if their predicted median IC50 binding scores were ≤500nM while expressed transcripts per million (TPM) exceeds 1 in tumor samples.
 Results:
 Using systematic bioinformatics pipeline, we analyzed 24 NSCLC samples with matched tumor tissues and peripheral blood, and detected the 4677 mutations involving 2442 genes, including 2819 missense SNVs, 941 InDels, 229 gene fusion and 688 RNA alternative splicing events, 94.7% of which (4428 mutations involving in 2247 genes) were common with those reported in the TCGA-LUAD dataset. The average number of mutations was 194.8 in NSCLCs. We found that C>T/G>A transitions/ transversions were dominant. Missense mutations were the most frequent types of somatic mutation in the coding sequence regions. 98% of mutated genes were not detected simultaneously with DNA and RNA mutations.
 ADCK5
 ,
 CD151
 and
 EIF3K
 were identified as potential new driver genes. Genomic variation profiling identified 2213 potential neoantigens with a median IC50 binding score of ≤500nM and a transcript expression level of >1 TPM. Among these, 41 were listed in databases TSNAdb, IEDB, and CTDatabase. A total of 14 genes harboring identical mutations were detected, with the identical mutations observed in over 50% of the patient cohort. Notably, mutations in 14 genes were either gene fusions or RNA alternative splicing events, and core antigenic sequences generated were found to be identical in the majority of patients. Of particular interest is the RPRD2 gene, where an RNA exitrons site was detected in all patient samples, along with the identification of the same neoantigen core sequence.
 Conclusions:
 Our analysis suggests that gene fusions and RNA splicing variations are more likely than point mutations to generate shared antigens, underscoring their importance for developing targeted immunotherapies.

 Background:
 Intratumoral heterogeneity, driven by phenotypic plasticity, contributes to disease progression and therapy failures. However, a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms is still lacking. Breast cancer exemplifies this with its histological and molecular diversity; estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), progesterone receptor-positive (PR+), and HER2- luminal A subtypes, such as the MCF7 cell line, are not the exception. While single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and three-dimensional multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) represent initial approaches to understanding heterogeneity, integrating these tools with computational strategies offers new paths to uncover the regulatory groundwork of tumor behavior. When modeled via Boolean frameworks, transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) provide a dynamic platform for studying gene interactions, identifying attractors (stable cellular states corresponding to distinct phenotypes), and simulating cellular transitions. This study represents the first step in constructing such a framework for ER+ breast cancer to advance precision medicine and improve therapeutic strategies.
 Methods:
 Regulatory elements relevant to the MCF7 cell line were identified through an extensive review of NCBI literature. Interactions were strictly curated based on evidence quality (ranging from robust experimental validation to predictive hypotheses), and evaluated for type and significance, such as feedback loops, activation, coactivation, and inhibition. Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) were used to translate regulatory connections into Boolean functions to simulate binary gene expression dynamics. The final TRN was visualized using Cytoscape (v3.10.3) with a hierarchical layout.
 Results:
 The TRN consists of 54 nodes and 81 interactions, representing the regulatory landscape of ER+, PR+, and HER2- breast cancer. Boolean equations offer a framework for simulating the evolution of binary states to attractors, enabling the observation of how perturbations, such as gene overexpression or silencing, influence heterogeneity. While simulation and attractor analyses are ongoing, the network provides a foundation for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying breast cancer plasticity.
 Conclusions:
 This study highlights the potential of integrating experimental data, TRN reconstruction, and Boolean modeling to understand intratumoral heterogeneity. Our rigorously curated model establishes a foundational framework for precision oncology and the integration of experimental and computational methods.

        <tr id="Background Colon cancer (CC) is one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide, with rising incidence rates in both developed and developing countries. Although advances in treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies have been made, prognosis for advanced colon cancer, particularly with metastasis, remains poor. Recent studies highlight the significant role of post-transcriptional modifications like acetylation in cancer biology, affecting processes like gene transcription, metabolism, and tumor progression. Methods This study applied multi-omics analyses, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and Mendelian randomization. Data were obtained from public datasets like GSE132465, UCSC Xena, and GeneCards. We focused on acetylation-related genes, specifically NAT10 and GNE, using scoring methods, cell–cell interaction models, and survival analyses to investigate their role in colon cancer development, metastasis, and immune evasion. Results This study identifies that NAT10 is highly expressed in epithelial cells of colorectal cancer (CC) and is closely associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that NAT10-positive epithelial cells exhibited strong interactions with myeloid cells and T cells, with significant differences in cell–cell communication (p < 0.05). Based-on-summary-data Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis further supports a causal relationship between NAT10 and colorectal cancer. In the MR analysis, a significant positive correlation was observed between NAT10 and colorectal cancer risk using summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies (β_SMR = 0.004, p_SMR = 0.041, p_HEIDI = 0.737). These findings suggest that NAT10 may serve as a pathogenic factor in colorectal cancer development, providing additional genetic evidence that links this acetylation-related gene to colorectal cancer. Survival analysis further demonstrated that NAT10-positive epithelial cells are associated with poorer prognosis. In the TCGA dataset, patients with NAT10-positive epithelial cells exhibited a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.012). Unlike GNE-positive cells, NAT10-positive epithelial cells exhibited immune escape characteristics, and TIDE analysis indicated that NAT10-positive epithelial cells were associated with a lower response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (p = 1.3e−5), suggesting that they may impair the efficacy of immunotherapy by promoting immune evasion. In contrast, GNE was also significantly expressed in epithelial cells of colorectal cancer, but its role differs from that of NAT10. GNE-positive epithelial cells demonstrated strong communication with immune cells, particularly in interactions between myeloid cells and T cells through receptor-ligand pairs. Despite the important role of GNE-positive epithelial cells in the tumor microenvironment, their association with immune escape is weaker compared to NAT10. Survival analysis revealed that GNE-positive epithelial cells were associated with a better prognosis (p = 0.015). In the TCGA dataset, patients with GNE-positive epithelial cells displayed longer disease-free survival (DFS), contrary to the results from the SMR analysis. Conclusions Leveraging SMR and multi-omics analysis, this study highlights the significant role of acetylation-related genes, particularly NAT10, in colon cancer. The findings suggest that acetylation modifications in epithelial cells contribute to immune evasion and cancer progression. NAT10 could serve as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for early diagnosis and targeted therapy, offering new avenues for improving colon cancer treatment and patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Molecular genetic diagnoses are critical to prevention and treatment of inherited polyposis and colorectal cancer. 19 genes responsible for these conditions are known, but many severely affected patients and families remain unsolved. Cryptic intronic variants that alter splicing of these genes and incomplete characterisation of recessive predisposition contribute to these diagnostic gaps. Methods Adaptive sampling long-read DNA sequencing targeted to 19 colon cancer genes, paired with direct long-read RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing, was undertaken for four patients referred for deficiency of mismatch repair proteins and/or familial polyposis, for whom multigene panel testing yielded negative or uncertain germline results. Results Genetic diagnoses were obtained for all four patients. Each patient carried a cryptic intronic germline variant in a different colon cancer gene. The variants abrogated splicing by various mechanisms, all leading to loss of gene function. Patient 1 was heterozygous for intronic insertion into MSH2 of an Alu element, leading to extension of transcription into the affected intron and a stop. Patient 2 was heterozygous for deep intronic insertion into APC of a Long Interspersed Nuclear Element (LINE), creating a pseudoexon and a stop. Patient 3 was compound heterozygous at MLH3, including a cryptic intronic substitution leading to exon skipping and a stop. Patient 4 was compound heterozygous at MUTYH, including a deep intronic deletion yielding an extremely short intron and transcriptional loss of an exon encoding a critical protein domain. Conclusion Paired long-read DNA and RNA sequencing can enhance diagnostic yield through detection of cryptic intronic variants that impact cancer predisposition.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating malignancy with a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of approximately 12%. More than 90% of PDAC patients harbor oncogenic mutations in the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral homolog (KRAS) gene. MRTX1133 (MRTX), a novel inhibitor of KRASG12D (the most common KRAS mutation found in pancreatic and colon cancers) has shown promise as a therapeutic agent. To address reported resistance to MRTX, we adapted our anti-leukemia co-targeting strategy and evaluated a combination of MRTX and Bedaquiline (BED), an FDA-approved inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP production, in in vitro human PDAC models. The combination of MRTX and BED demonstrated enhanced cytotoxic effects by disrupting all 11 genes within the DNA helicase family (CMG complex: CDC45-MCM-GINS), which are essential for initiating DNA replication and regulating cell cycle progression. Notably, real-world data analysis from Caris Life Sciences and NCI-TCGA database revealed that low transcriptomic expression of the DNA helicase CMG complex was significantly associated with prolonged survival (e.g., low CDC45 expression and low GINS2 expression with greater than 8 months longer overall survival) in PDAC patients with KRASG12 mutations (N = 9,717; P < 0.00001). However, this combination therapy also triggered strong pro-survival nuclear reprogramming. This effect was mediated by significant genetic activation of an NFκB2-DDIT (DNA damage-induced transcript) axis, which supported tumor chromosomal integrity and DNA repair mechanisms. To overcome NFκB2-driven resistance mechanisms, we explored a triple-targeting strategy that addresses metabolic and genomic plasticity in addition to actively intercepting cell division. This approach combines MRTX1133, Bedaquiline, and the NFκB2 inhibitor SN52, offering a novel therapeutic avenue to treat aggressive pancreatic cancer and potentially improve patient outcomes.

        <tr id="One of the key challenges in defeating advanced tumors is the ability of cancer cells to evade the selective pressure imposed by chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy and cellular therapies. Both genetic and epigenetic alterations contribute to the development of resistance, allowing cancer cells to survive initially effective treatments. In this narration, we explore how genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms influence the state of tumor cells and their responsiveness to different therapeutic strategies. We further propose that an altered balance between cell growth and cell death is a fundamental driver of drug resistance. Cell death programs exist in various forms, shaped by cell type, triggering factors, and microenvironmental conditions. These processes are governed by temporal and spatial constraints and appear to be more heterogeneous than previously understood. To capture the intricate interplay between death-inducing signals and survival mechanisms, we introduce the concept of Death-ision. This framework highlights the dynamic nature of cell death regulation, determining whether specific cancer cell clones evade or succumb to therapy. Building on this understanding offers promising strategies to counteract resistant clones and enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, combining DNMT inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade may counteract YAP1-driven resistance or the use of transcriptional CDK inhibitors could prevent or overcome chemotherapy resistance. Death-ision aims to provide a deeper understanding of the diversity and evolution of cell death programs, not only at diagnosis but also throughout disease progression and treatment adaptation.">

        <tr id="Comprehensive genomic analysis is essential for advancing our understanding of human genetics and disease. However, short-read sequencing technologies are inherently limited in their ability to resolve highly repetitive, structurally complex, and low-mappability genomic regions, previously coined as “dark” regions. Long-read sequencing technologies, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), offer improved resolution of these regions, yet they are not perfect. With the advent of the new Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) CHM13 reference genome, exploring its effect on dark regions is prudent. In this study, we systematically analyze dark regions across four human genome references—HG19, HG38 (with and without alternate contigs), and CHM13—using both short- and long-read sequencing data. We found that dark regions increase as the reference becomes more complete, especially dark-by-MAPQ regions, but that long-read sequencing significantly reduces the number of dark regions in the genome, particularly within gene bodies. However, we identify potential alignment challenges in long-read data, such as centromeric regions. These findings highlight the importance of both reference genome selection and sequencing technology choice in achieving a truly comprehensive genomic analysis.">

Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting were used to detect the radiation-induced changes in the expression of RNAs and proteins, respectively. RT-qPCR revealed that MLH1 and MSH6 genes were stably expressed regardless of the MMR status of the cell line and the radiation dose. In contrast, the MSH2 gene was either up-regulated or down-regulated after 2 Gy or 10 Gy or both. The expression of PMS2 increased after 10 Gy irradiation in all MMR-deficient cell lines, even though the data were not statistically significant compared to other doses, except for the LoVo cell line. Protein expression analysed using Western blotting demonstrated that MLH1 protein expression was stable, whereas the expression of MSH2 was significantly affected by radiation exposure in both MLH1-deficient cell lines. No correlation between the expression of RNA and protein could be identified. In conclusion, radiation may have significantly differential effects on MMR RNA and protein expression when different cell lines, doses, and specific genes are considered.">

        <tr id="
 Breast cancer pathogenesis is closely linked to the mechanisms of cellular reprogramming, the process of converting differentiated cells into undifferentiated or different cell types. This reprogramming is achieved through the orchestrated expression of transcription factors which alter the cell’s existing chromatin landscape and establish a transcriptome corresponding to the reprogrammed cell state. Pioneer factors, a type of transcription factor, initiate cell development and cell fate transition by binding to specific DNA motifs within nucleosomes. This binding leads to the recruitment of co-factors, such as nucleosome remodelers, leading to chromatin opening and subsequent activation of specific genes essential for reprogrammed cell function. Improper engagement of these factors can lead to unanticipated or harmful gene expression, potentially contributing to various human diseases, including cancer. GATA3, a pioneer factor, is essential for normal mammary gland development and differentiation. In breast cancer cells, GATA3 has been shown to suppress tumor growth by inducing mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), the reverse process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Interestingly, although mutations in GATA3 are frequent and considered driver mutations, breast cancer patients carrying GATA3 mutations are generally associated with better patient survival. The roles of these mutations remain largely unexplored. M294R and M294K are hot spot missense mutations found in luminal breast cancer patients. These mutations occur in the DNA-binding domain of GATA3, which is crucial for its function as a transcription factor. For functional characterization of these mutants, we utilized MDA-MB-231 mesenchymal cells, a highly aggressive and invasive breast cancer cell line to model mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Since ectopic expression of GATA3 induces MET in this cell line, these cells provide an excellent system to observe phenotypic and molecular alterations caused by its missense mutations M294R/K. To quantitatively measure changes in GATA3 mobility and its DNA binding dynamics in living cells, we utilized Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) assay. Additionally, to further elucidate the crucial role of GATA3, genomics analyses and phenotypic assays were conducted. Functional characterization of M294R/K mutants in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells demonstrated distinct phenotypic and molecular alterations compared to wild-type GATA3. While wild-type GATA3 induced MET, mutant-expressing cells exhibited differential responses. Remarkably, mutants derived from breast cancer patients displayed increased chromatin binding, leading to a tighter chromatin structure and differential gene expression of mesenchymal or epithelial markers. Altered cellular phenotypes such as cell migration are also observed in M294R/K expressed cells. Our finding underscores the importance of precise regulation of pioneer factor-chromatin interactions in cellular reprogramming processes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying GATA3 mutations and their effects on cellular reprogramming in breast cancer provides valuable insights into the roles of GATA3 in breast cancer progression.

Here, we consider colorectal cancer (CRC) as an example to review the technological and conceptual advances in microenvironmental regulation of cancer stemness. Some unique features of CRC, including reprogramming of stromal cells, bacterial niche alteration, and metabolic interplay, were summarized to illustrate how the TME affects the plasticity of CSCs.

        <tr id="Background Cancer cells undergo widespread changes in epigenetic patterns that mediate cancer compromised gene expression programs during cancer progression. However, the alterations in higher-order genome organization in which these changes occur and their functional implications are less well understood. To explore how chromatin structure and epigenetic parameters of genome architecture changes during cancer progression at a fine scale and genome-wide, we generated high-resolution Micro-C contact maps in non-malignant, pre-cancerous, and metastatic MCF10 breast cancer epithelial cells. Results We profiled progression-associated reorganization of chromatin compartments, topologically associated domains (TADs), and chromatin loops, and also identified invariable chromatin features. We find large-scale compartmental shifts occur predominantly in early stages of cancer development, with more fine-scale structural changes in TADs and looping accumulating during the later transition to metastasis. We related these structural features to changes in gene expression, histone marks, and potential enhancers and found a large portion of diYerentially expressed genes physically connected to distal regulatory elements. While changes in chromatin loops were relatively rare during progression, diYerential loops were enriched for progression-associated genes, including those involved in proliferation, angiogenesis, and diYerentiation. Changes in either enhancer-promoter contacts or distal enhancer activity were accompanied by diYerential gene regulation, suggesting that changes in chromatin contacts are not necessary but can be suYicient for gene regulation. Conclusions Together, our results demonstrate a functionally relevant connection between gene regulation and genome remodeling at many key genes during cancer progression. KEY FINDINGS ‒ The cancer genome is reorganized throughout cancer progression at the level of compartments, chromatin domains, and loops ‒ Compartmental shifts occur in early stages of cancer development, with more fine-scale structural changes accumulating during metastasis ‒ Chromatin domain boundaries are weakened during cancer progression ‒ Many progression-regulated genes exhibit changes in distal enhancer histone modifications that are bridged by stable chromatin loops ‒ Changes in enhancer activity or subtle changes in chromatin contacts can rewire enhancer-promoter connections to facilitate changes in gene expression ‒ Prominent changes in chromatin loops occur at a small subset of diYerentially regulated genes during progression">

        <tr id="The tumorigenesis of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (siNETs) is not understood and comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic data sets are limited. Therefore, we performed whole genome and transcriptome analysis of 39 well differentiated siNET samples. Our genomic data revealed a lack of recurrent driver mutations and demonstrated that multifocal siNETs from individual patients can arise genetically independently. We detected germline mutations in Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway (FANC) genes, involved in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair, in 9% of patients and found mutational signatures of defective HR DNA repair in late-stage tumor evolution. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed low expression of the transcriptional repressor REST. Summarizing, we identify a novel common transcriptomic signature of siNETs and demonstrate that genomic alterations alone do not explain initial tumor formation, while impaired DNA repair likely contributes to tumor evolution and represents a potential pharmaceutical target in a subset of patients.">

        <tr id="Cancer progression and development are influenced by a complex interplay between inherited (germline) and acquired (somatic) mutations. Current cancer genomic research in Middle Eastern populations predominantly utilizes targeted panels to examine predefined genes, potentially overlooking a broader spectrum of genomic contributions to cancer predisposition. Addressing this gap, this study adopts an unbiased approach using whole exome sequencing (WES) data to identify both high- and low-penetrance genetic variants within the United Arab Emirates (UAE) population. This investigation features a case-control matching analysis comprising 62 patients diagnosed with various cancer types and 142 unrelated healthy controls. The results showed a potential association between cancer predisposition and variants within. The results demonstrate an association between cancer predisposition and variants within C-terminal Binding Protein 2 (CTBP2), DNA Polymerase Theta (POLQ) and Tektin 4 (TEKT4). Gene set enrichment analysis showed enriched pathways associated with cancer-related biological processes such as DNA repair and depleted pathways related to translation, cellular metabolic process, and mitochondrial functions. This study highlights that the distinctive genetic composition of underrepresented groups influences the penetrance of pathogenic variants that could contribute to hereditary cancer risk in ways that diverge from patterns observed in more extensively researched cohorts.

        <tr id="Background Targeted therapy interventions using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) provide encouraging treatment responses in patients with ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinomas, yet resistance occurs almost inevitably. In addition to tumor cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms, accumulating evidence suggests that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor microenvironment contribute to therapy resistance. This study aimed to investigate CAF-driven molecular networks that shape the therapeutic susceptibility of ALK-driven lung adenocarcinoma cells. Methods Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid co-cultures comprising ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma cells and CAFs were utilized to model the tumor microenvironment. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to uncover transcriptional differences between TKI-treated homotypic and heterotypic spheroids. Functional assays assessed the effects of CAF-conditioned medium and CAF-secreted factors on tumor cell survival, proliferation, lipid metabolism, and downstream AKT signaling. The therapeutic potential of targeting metabolic vulnerabilities was evaluated using pharmacological inhibition of lipid metabolism and by ferroptosis induction. Results CAFs significantly diminished the apoptotic response of lung tumor cells to ALK inhibitors while simultaneously enhancing their proliferative capacity. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified lipogenesis-associated genes as a key transcriptional difference between TKI-treated homotypic and heterotypic lung tumor spheroids. CAF-conditioned medium and the CAF-secreted factors HGF and NRG1 activated AKT signaling in 3D-cultured ALK-rearranged lung tumor cells, leading to increased de novo lipogenesis and suppression of lipid peroxidation. These metabolic adaptations were critical for promoting tumor cell survival and fostering therapy resistance. Notably, both dual inhibition of ALK and the lipid-regulatory factor SREBP-1, as well as co-treatment with ferroptosis inducers such as erastin or RSL3, effectively disrupted the CAF-driven metabolic-supportive niche and restored sensitivity of resistant lung tumor spheroids to ALK inhibition. Conclusions This study highlights a critical role for CAFs in mediating resistance to ALK-TKIs by reprogramming lipid metabolism in ALK-rearranged lung cancer cells. It suggests that targeting these metabolic vulnerabilities, particularly through inhibition of lipid metabolism or induction of ferroptosis, could provide a novel therapeutic approach to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Uveal melanoma (UM) is a highly aggressive intraocular malignancy with limited therapeutic options for metastatic disease. Existing transgenic UM mouse models inadequately recapitulate human disease progression, while transplant models lack immune competence for studying the tumor immune microenvironment and therapeutic interventions. To address these limitations, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model incorporating stepwise genetic alterations implicated in human UM progression. Spatiotemporally controlled expression of mutant GNAQQ209L from the endogenous locus induced choroidal nevi with limited penetrance. Concomitant BAP1 deletion enhanced nevus formation, while further MYC activation led to fully penetrant intraocular tumors with metastatic potential. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed malignant cells segregated into Melanocytic and Neural Crest-like subpopulations characterized by distinct transcriptional and biosynthetic programs. Trajectory analyses inferred dedifferentiation from the Melanocytic toward the Neural Crest-like state during tumor progression. Comparison to human UM revealed commonalities with highly aggressive Class 2 UM, including gene expression signatures and copy number gains affecting genes that map to human chromosome 8q beyond the activated MYC allele, suggesting cooperative effects of multiple drivers in this chromosomal region. The tumor microenvironment featured immunosuppressive macrophage populations and exhausted T cells, closely resembling human UM. This physiologically relevant, immune-competent model provides a platform for investigating UM biology, functionally characterizing candidate driver genes, and developing immune-based therapeutic strategies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We developed a mouse model that resembles the genetic progression and phenotypic plasticity of human UM. This spatially controlled model confirms the critical role of driver mutations in GNAQ and BAP1, proposes MYC as a promoter of malignant transformation in coordination with other chromosome 8q genes, and reveals UM progression through distinct cellular states. This model offers an urgently needed preclinical platform for understanding the immunogenomics of UM and for testing immune and targeted treatments for this lethal cancer.">

To identify the underlying mutational processes, we utilized a clinically annotated cohort of 3,880 patient samples with tumor-normal sequencing. Mutational signatures associated with apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) enzymes were prevalent and enriched in post-treatment hormone receptor-positive cancers. These signatures correlated with shorter progression-free survival on antiestrogen plus CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. Whole-genome sequencing of breast cancer models and paired primary-metastatic samples demonstrated that active APOBEC3 mutagenesis promoted therapy resistance through characteristic alterations such as RB1 loss. Evidence of APOBEC3 activity in pretreatment samples illustrated its pervasive role in breast cancer evolution. These studies reveal APOBEC3 mutagenesis to be a frequent mediator of therapy resistance in breast cancer and highlight its potential as a biomarker and target for overcoming resistance.">

        <tr id="Lymphomas are highly heterogeneous malignancies characterized by diverse genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic profiles, which complicate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Traditional bulk sequencing methods mask the complexity of intratumoral variation, often overlooking rare subclones that may drive disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Single-cell genomics has emerged as a transformative approach to decipher tumor heterogeneity at unprecedented resolution. This technology enables the dissection of individual cellular populations within lymphomas, offering insights into clonal evolution, transcriptional diversity, and microenvironmental interactions. By applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), chromatin accessibility assays (scATAC-seq), and single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq), researchers can unravel lineage relationships, identify resistant subpopulations, and track dynamic changes in response to therapy. In lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), single-cell approaches have revealed distinct malignant and non-malignant cell states that correlate with treatment outcomes. Moreover, integrating single-cell data with spatial transcriptomics and immune profiling enhances the understanding of the tumor microenvironment, including immune evasion mechanisms. These insights can inform personalized treatment strategies, identify novel therapeutic targets, and enable early detection of relapse. Despite technical challenges such as data complexity, sample viability, and cost, the application of single-cell genomics in lymphoma research is rapidly advancing. Future directions include multi-omics integration, real-time patient monitoring, and clinical translation of predictive biomarkers.

The throughput of sci-L3-Strand-seq also gave us the ability to measure subtle phenotypes, opening the door for future large mutational screens. Furthermore, mapping clonal lineages provided insights into the temporal order of certain genome instability events, showcasing the potential to dissect cancer evolution.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which DDX41 variants contribute to the pathogenesis of myeloid neoplasms remain poorly understood, partly due to challenges in establishing cellular and animal models that faithfully recapitulate the human disease phenotype. This limitation highlights the necessity of directly analyzing primary human disease cells. In this case report, conducted to pursue this objective, we implemented single-cell RNA sequencing integrated with genotyping at the p.R525 locus in a myelodysplastic neoplasm (MDS) harboring both germline and somatic DDX41 variants, leveraging highly efficient Terminator-Assisted Solid-phase cDNA amplification and sequencing. We found that acquiring p.R525H induced G2/M cell cycle arrest selectively in colony-forming unit-erythroid cells, accompanied by R-loop accumulation, which impaired erythropoiesis through DNA damage. In hematopoietic stem and myeloid progenitor populations, gene expression profiles were largely similar between p.R525H-positive and -negative cells. However, ligand-receptor interaction and transcriptional regulation analyses suggested a non-cell-autonomous influence from p.R525H-expressing cells on GL variant-only cells. This interaction drove convergence toward a shared expression profile, highlighting an intricate interplay shaping the patient’s MDS phenotype.">

We apply DiffInvex to >11,000 somatic whole-genome sequences from ~30 cancer types or healthy tissues, identifying genes where point mutations are under conditional positive or negative selection during exposure to specific chemotherapeutics, suggesting drug resistance mechanisms occurring via point mutation. DiffInvex identifies 11 genes exhibiting treatment-associated selection for different classes of chemotherapies, linking selected mutations in PIK3CA, APC, MAP2K4, SMAD4, STK11 and MAP3K1 with drug exposure. Various gene-chemotherapy associations are further supported by differential functional impact of mutations pre- versus post-therapy, and are also replicated in independent studies. In addition to nominating drug resistance genes, we contrast the genomes of healthy versus cancerous cells of matched human tissues. We identify noncancerous expansion-specific drivers, including NOTCH1 and ARID1A. DiffInvex can also be applied to diverse analyses in cancer evolution to identify changes in driver gene repertoires across time or space.">

        <tr id="Alternative splicing (AS) is a pivotal post-transcriptional mechanism that expands the functional diversity of the proteome by enabling a single gene to generate multiple mRNA and protein isoforms. This process, which involves the differential inclusion or exclusion of exons and introns, is tightly regulated by splicing factors (SFs), such as serine/arginine-rich proteins (SRs), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), and RNA-binding motif (RBM) proteins. These factors recognize specific sequences, including 5′ and 3′ splice sites and branch points, to ensure precise splicing. While AS is essential for normal cellular function, its dysregulation is increasingly implicated in cancer pathogenesis. Aberrant splicing can lead to the production of oncogenic isoforms that promote tumorigenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Furthermore, such abnormalities can cause the loss of tumor-suppressing activity, thereby contributing to cancer development. Importantly, abnormal AS events can generate neoantigens, which are presented on tumor cell surfaces via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, suggesting novel targets for cancer immunotherapy. Additionally, splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) have shown promise as therapeutic agents because they modulate splicing patterns to restore normal gene function or induce tumor-suppressive isoforms. This review explores the mechanisms of AS dysregulation in cancer, its role in tumor progression, and its potential as a therapeutic target. We also discuss innovative technologies, such as high-throughput sequencing and computational approaches, that are revolutionizing the study of AS in cancer. Finally, we address the challenges and future prospects of targeting AS for personalized cancer therapies, emphasizing its potential in precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Cancer progression is a complex, multi-stage development process characterized by dynamic changes at the molecular level. Understanding these changes may provide new insights into tumorigenesis and potential therapeutic targets. This study focuses on the evolutionary transcriptomics of cancer, specifically analyzing the Transcriptome Age Index (TAI) across different pathological stages. By examining various cancers at four distinct pathological stages, we identify a significant «hourglass» pattern in TAI indices of ductal carcinoma of the breast, bladder carcinoma, and liver carcinoma, suggesting a conserved evolutionary trajectory during tumor development. The results reveal that early and late stages of these cancers exhibit higher TAI values, indicative of more novel gene expression, while intermediate stages show a dip in TAI, reflecting a more ancient evolutionary origin of expressed genes. This «hourglass» pattern underscores the evolutionary constraints and innovations at play during tumor progression. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that evolutionary principles are deeply embedded in cancer biology, offering new perspectives on the dynamics of gene expression in tumors.">

        <tr id="Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) has emerged as a dynamic and versatile genomic element with key roles in physiological regulation and disease pathology. This review synthesizes current knowledge on eccDNA, covering its classification, biogenesis, detection methods, biological functions, and clinical implications. Once considered rare anomalies, eccDNAs are now recognized as major drivers of oncogene amplification, genomic plasticity, and therapeutic resistance, particularly in cancer. EccDNA subtypes such as microDNA, double minutes, and ecDNA are defined by their structural, genomic, and pathological features. EccDNAs originate through diverse mechanisms including DNA repair, chromothripsis, breakage fusion bridge cycles, and apoptosis, occurring in both normal and stressed cells. Advances in long-read and single-cell sequencing, CRISPR-based synthesis, and computational tools have improved detection and functional analysis. Functionally, eccDNAs contribute to transcriptional amplification, activate immune responses through cGAS-STING signaling, and facilitate intercellular communication. They are found across a range of tissues and disease states—including cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, autoimmune, and metabolic disorders—and serve as both biomarkers and regulatory elements. We introduce the concept of the stress selection theory, which proposes eccDNA as an adaptive reservoir that enhances cellular fitness in response to environmental and therapeutic pressures. Despite growing insights, challenges remain in understanding tissue-specific roles, achieving clinical translation, and standardizing methodologies. Emerging tools in multi-omics, spatial biology, and artificial intelligence are expected to drive future breakthroughs in precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Cancer initiation occurs when a cell acquires and accumulates mutations in genes involved in the regulation of cell processes: each cell division throughout a person’s life introduces novel mutations in the cells’ DNA and under normal circumstances, the body is primed to prevent those from leading to cancer. Occasionally, a subset of those mutations escapes those safeguards and might eventually result in the emergence of the disease. To understand the dynamics of accumulation of somatic mutations, we have performed longitudinal whole genome sequencing of DNA obtained from whole blood from healthy individuals and cancer patients using Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ Long Read Sequencing. Here we show that the number of somatic single nucleotide variants detected increases with their age and that for specific mutational processes, changes can be detected within months. We computed aggregated metrics for unique participants at each timepoint across types of variants (based on single based substitution molecular signatures) and identified patterns of change both over an individual’s lifespan (age) and over the sampling period (months). This study showcases the suitability of long read sequencing of blood DNA for detecting coarse-grained differences over time and enable future development of “state of the system” personalized prevention programs.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Aneuploidy is near-ubiquitous in cancer and can decrease chemotherapy efficacy while also sensitizing cells to other drugs. Methods: To systematically identify treatment strategies that target aneuploid cancers, data were integrated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; 10,967 samples, 16,948 aneuploidy events) and the Broad Institute’s Profiling Relative Inhibition Simultaneously in Mixtures (PRISM) screen of 578 cancer cell lines and 4518 compounds. Results: Our analyses uncovered 37,720 significant positive and negative associations linking specific aneuploidies and treatments with patient prognosis or cell viability. Within TCGA data, 22 treatments correlated with improved 5-year survival for specific aneuploid cancers, whereas 46 were linked to worse outcomes. A complementary analysis of PRISM identified 17,946 compound–aneuploidy associations and 16,189 mechanism of action (MOA)–aneuploidy associations. Pathway-altering compounds that selectively reduce viability in cells with aneuploidy profiles were discovered, including an unexpectedly prominent number of glucocorticoid receptor agonists. Conclusions: This integrated dataset provides a resource for designing therapeutic decision hypotheses, identifying drug-repurposing opportunities, and informing future studies aimed at targeting aneuploidy-induced vulnerabilities in cancer.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis of CRC primarily stems from the gradual accumulation of genetic mutations, which drive oncogene (e.g., KRAS) activation and tumor suppressor gene (e.g., TP53) inactivation. Loss of genetic stability facilitates the conversion of proto-oncogenes into active oncogenes and the functional impairment of tumor suppressors, collectively propelling CRC progression. The tumor suppressor protein p53, a transcription factor, induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair under cellular stress, and prevents cancer development by regulating various cellular responses. However, in CRC pathogenesis, TP53 mutations (detected in ~ 74% of cases) subvert these protective mechanisms through dual mechanisms: (i) dominant-negative suppression of wild-type p53 (wt-p53) function, and (ii) acquisition of neomorphic pro-tumorigenic activities, termed gain-of-function (GOF) mutations. New evidence from laboratory and clinical trials shows that some new therapeutic strategies have the potential to treat CRC by reactivating and restoring p53 function, depleting p53 mutants, or targeting p53 with immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the function of p53 and characterize its mutation in CRC, emphasizing the influence of p53 mutation in the pathogenesis of CRC. In addition, we also describe the current therapeutic strategies for targeting p53 mutants in CRC.">

        <tr id="Cancer development requires an evolutionary transformation from mammalian cells fully regulated by and integrated into multicellular tissue to cancer cells that, as single cell protists, are individually subject to Darwinian selection. Through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance, the evolving cancer phenotype must acquire independence from host controls, downregulate differentiated functions that benefit the host but not individual cells, and generate phenotypic traits that increase fitness in the context of the selection forces within the local microenvironment. Here, we investigate this evolutionary transition in breast (BRCA) and lung (LUAD, without EGFR, KRAS or BRAF driver mutations) adenocarcinomas using bulk mutation and expression data from the TCGA database. We define evolution selection for genes and molecular pathways based on 1) changes in gene expression compared to normal tissue, and 2) significantly larger or smaller observed mutation rates compared to those expected based on the gene size. We find BRCA and LUAD disable different genes and gene pathways associated with tissue-specific signaling and differentiated functions but promote common molecular pathways associated with cell cycle, cell-cell interactions, cytoskeleton, voltage gated ion channels, and microenvironmental niche construction. Thus, tissue-specific parallel evolution in early cancer development is followed by convergence to a common cancer phenotype.">

        <tr id="CRISPR has become a revolutionary tool for cancer biology and therapy with unprecedented precision for genome editing. Besides cancer, CRISPR is also under research for possible use in the treatment of viral diseases, such as Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), a serious livestock problem. Through enabling gene modifications to be made to individual genes, CRISPR is used in identifying oncogenic drivers, characterizing tumor suppressor networks, and designing innovative therapeutics. This review focuses on the various uses of CRISPR for cancer studies with special attention to methods like gene knockout, gene activation, and base editing that each has a great potential for correcting oncogenic mutations and restoring tumor suppressor activity. Moreover, CRISPR's capacity to regulate viral replication, as that of BVDV, signifies its dual role in oncology as well as in viral pathogenesis. Interventions based on CRISPR such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy and synthetic lethality are essentially revolutionizing cancer therapy by improving immune responses and capitalizing on the specificity that is characteristic of cancer cells. However, off-target effects, tumor heterogeneity, and ethical dilemmas remain onerous challenges for clinical application. CRISPR delivery systems, despite playing a central role in advancing cancer therapies, also have prospects in optimizing the effectiveness of treatment against viral pathogens like BVDV. Advances in delivery systems using nanoparticles and viral vectors are mitigating against these challenges and improving efficacy and specificity of CRISPR reagent in vivo. In addition to this, continued progress in new technologies such as prime editing and base editing is predicted to improve precision and efficacy of CRISPR-based therapy. Since CRISPR technology is continuously developing, CRISPR's potential to treat both cancer and viral infections, like BVDV, simultaneously will be instrumental in precision medicine. This review highlights the revolutionary potential of CRISPR to revolutionize cancer treatment paradigms and brings hope for more effective and individualized therapy. With potential developments to emergent and potentiated CRISPR tools and reagents, it is predicted that they will play a center stage role in precision oncology and promote better patient results.">

Here, we show that this heterogeneity propagates across generations to give rise to phenotypic resistance. Using real-time single-cell tracking, we exposed Escherichia coli to the β-lactam cefsulodin at its clinical breakpoint concentration and analyzed cell fate within genealogical trees statistically. Cell survival was strongly correlated among family members, driving the selective enrichment of robust lineages within an otherwise susceptible population. Our genealogical population model identified heritable phenotypic resistance as a key factor underlying this enrichment, which was validated experimentally. Comparing enrichment dynamics between the wild-type and a tolC knock-out strain, deficient in multidrug efflux, uncovered nuanced changes that increased the intergenerational memory of phenotypic resistance. Our findings provide evidence for heritable phenotypic resistance and demonstrate how its propagation through cell-to-cell heterogeneity enables the survival of minority cells within isogenic populations.">

 The combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) with endocrine therapy prolongs survival of patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Nearly all patients with advanced disease treated with this combination eventually progress, highlighting a need for therapeutic interventions that prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Drug tolerant persister (DTP) cells represent a reservoir of surviving cells from which drug-resistant clones eventually emerge. We hypothesize that targeting the DTP state which emerges under selective pressure from CDK4/6i could prevent the emergence of drug resistance. In vitro treatment of MCF7 and T47D ER+/HER2- breast cancer cells with the CDK4/6i Palbociclib and estrogen deprivation for 4 weeks suppressed cell viability with 2-5% of cells surviving treatment and achieving a DTP state. Cell cycle analysis by PI staining revealed that 95% of the DTP cells were arrested in G0/G1 after 4 weeks of continuous therapy. Upon drug washout, the DTP population resumed proliferation within ∼1 week and regained sensitivity to retreatment with CDK4/6i, suggesting epigenetic reprogramming is responsible for the DTP state. Whole exome sequencing did not show enrichment of known genomic alterations associated with CDK4/6i resistance (e.g., RB1, FAT1, PTEN). Bulk RNA sequencing of MCF7 DTP cells revealed transcriptome reprogramming compared to untreated controls, which reverted upon drug washout to that of the treatment naïve state. While cell cycle-related gene signatures such as E2F targets and G2M checkpoint were downregulated, interferon response signatures were upregulated in MCF7 DTP cells relative to untreated controls. MCF7 persisters were characterized by enrichment in senescence and chemotherapy-induced stressed gene signatures, while diapause and MYC target signatures were downregulated. These same signatures were similarly enriched in ER+/HER2- tumors from patients in the NeoPalAna study treated with neoadjuvant palbociclib and the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole compared to baseline biopsies. To study evolution of drug resistance, we transduced MCF7 and T47D cells with the LARRY (Lineage and RNA recovery) barcode library to uniquely label and track each persister cells long-term, and identify programs that are causal to the emergence of drug resistant clones. We performed single cell RNA-seq on barcoded cells treated with palbociclib plus estrogen deprivation for 0 h, 72 h, and 4 weeks. Several clones that arrested in G0/G1 initially eventually expanded at 4 weeks, while other clones were eliminated. We are currently investigating which genes/pathways are upregulated in the barcoded clones enriched at the 4-week time point. We will then validate results from these single cell approach in cells surviving neoadjuvant treatment in the NeoPalAna trial. In summary, a small subset of ER+/HER2- breast cancer cells survive long-term treatment with CDK4/6i plus estrogen deprivation and exhibits reversible transcriptomic features of DTPs. Our ongoing single cell-seq analyses may reveal transcriptional programs that enable the DTP state which, in turn, could be targeted to reduce survival of drug-tolerant cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance.

For those treated with BRAF/MEK combination therapy, in the setting of V600 BRAF mutations, or immunotherapies regardless of somatic genetic make-up, resistance eventually develops in the majority of cases. Developing rational combination therapies, as suggested by preclinical studies involving genetic manipulation of resistance mediators, necessitates a substantial expansion of druggable targets. Novel chemistry strategies, such as chemoproteomics platforms and chemical inducer of proximity (CIP) agents, offer promising solutions. Chemoproteomics enables the rapid identification of ligands to guide medicinal chemistry, while CIP agents alter the expression levels of key proteins. Using oncogene (such as NRAS) and p53 as pivotal resistance mediators, and the lineage-specific transcription factor SRY-box transcription factor 10 [SOX10]) in melanoma as illustrative examples, we demonstrate how these technologies can be leveraged to rapidly expand the druggable target pool and overcome resistance mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for regimens that produce deeper and more durable responses.">

        <tr id="Short tandem repeats (STRs) are repetitive DNA sequences that contribute to genetic diversity and play a significant role in disease susceptibility. The human genome contains approximately 1.5 million STR loci, collectively covering around 3% of the total sequence. Certain repeat expansions can significantly impact cellular function by altering protein synthesis, impairing DNA repair, and leading to neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. Traditional short-read sequencing struggles to accurately characterize STRs due to its limited read length, which limits the ability to resolve repeat expansions, increases mapping errors, and reduces sensitivity for detecting large insertions or interruptions. This review examines how long-read sequencing technologies, particularly Oxford Nanopore and PacBio, overcome these limitations by enabling direct sequencing of full STR regions with improved accuracy. We discuss challenges in sequencing, bioinformatics workflows, and the latest computational tools for STR detection. Additionally, we highlight the strengths and limitations of different methods, providing deeper insight into the future of STR genotyping.">

        <tr id="Identifying genetic mutations contributing to solid tumors by altering the biological pathways related to tumor formation and development is essential for the development of targeted therapies. This study aimed to identify commonly mutated genes and altered pathways in canine solid tumors. Four dogs with different types of naturally occurring neoplasias (urothelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma) were randomly selected and classified into carcinoma and sarcoma groups based on histopathological findings. Tumor tissues were analyzed using whole-genome sequencing, and significant variants shared within each tumor group were identified. Gene set enrichment analyses were conducted to compare the biological and functional pathways altered by the mutations in each carcinoma and sarcoma group. Forty-three and fifty-eight genes were identified in the carcinoma and sarcoma groups, respectively. Distinctions between the two tumor groups were noted for mutations related to tumor metastatic function. Mutations were identified in genes encoding cell adhesion molecules in the carcinoma group, whereas significant variations in extracellular matrix-related molecules were evident in the sarcoma group. This study revealed mutations and modified pathways associated with immune and tumor metastatic functions in canine carcinoma and sarcoma, indicating their significant relevance to the development and progression of each tumor group. Additionally, the distinctions indicated that different therapeutic approaches were required for each tumor group.">

        <tr id="Globally, gastric cancer (GC) stands as the fifth most prevalent form of malignant neoplasm and represents a significant contributor to mortality associated with oncological conditions. Despite advancements in therapeutic strategies for GC, the outcomes for patients with advanced stages of the disease continue to be unfavorable, largely due to tumor heterogeneity and the challenges posed by resistance to therapeutic agents. Metabolic reprogramming is pivotal in driving the advancement of GC, contributing to the development of resistance to pharmacological treatments and facilitating the cancer’s ability to evade immune surveillance. Developing multi-target comprehensive treatment strategies by integrating tumor microenvironment (TME) modulation holds promise for significantly improving therapeutic efficacy.The study analyzed GC and identified key cell subtypes by integrating data derived from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) alongside spatial transcriptomics information. Cell type identification was accomplished using the tool of Seurat, and the spatial distribution of cell types was revealed through the Robust Cell Type Decomposition technique. CellChat was used to analyze the interactions between key cell subtypes and other cells, and the “StLearn” package was employed to investigate spatial cell communication in depth. Additionally, the functional role of the key molecule ELK4 was validated through in vitro experiments.This research utilized scRNA-seq combined with spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively analyze GC, identifying the C1 NDUFAB1+ subtype, which exhibited high proliferative activity, metabolic reprogramming capabilities, and immune evasion properties. It was found that the C1 NDUFAB1+ subtype closely interacted with fibroblasts and pericytes via the PARs signaling pathway. Additionally, in vitro experiments confirmed that knockdown of ELK4 substantially curbed tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.This study revealed the main significance of the C1 NDUFAB1+ subtype in GC, elucidating its core mechanisms in tumor progression, metabolic reprogramming, and immune evasion. ELK4 was identified as a key regulatory factor that markedly enhanced the proliferation, migratory capacity, and invasive potential of tumor cells, while changes in the TME were a driving force behind immune suppression and drug resistance. The findings underscored the importance of developing specific therapeutic targets, targeting metabolic reprogramming, and overcoming immune evasion, providing new theoretical foundations.">

In a cohort of 64 patients in blast phase of a myeloproliferative neoplasm (BP-MPN), we describe recurrent amplification of a region of chromosome 21q (‘chr. 21amp’) in 25%, driven by chromothripsis in a third of these cases. We report that chr. 21amp BP-MPN has a particularly aggressive and treatment-resistant phenotype. DYRK1A, a serine threonine kinase, is the only gene in the 2.7-megabase minimally amplified region that showed both increased expression and chromatin accessibility compared with non-chr. 21amp BP-MPN controls. DYRK1A is a central node at the nexus of multiple cellular functions critical for BP-MPN development and is essential for BP-MPN cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and represents a druggable axis. Collectively, these findings define chr. 21amp as a prognostic biomarker in BP-MPN, and link chromothripsis to a therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Background Transcriptomic and genomic analyses of bladder cancer (BC) reveal a highly diverse disease stratified into molecular subtypes with distinct molecular features and biological behaviors. Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and plasticity can significantly impact diagnosis and patient management, yet their extent in BC remains highly debated. Here, we investigated whether the three main bladder cancer subtypes maintain or alter their identity in response to changes in the microenvironment and during metastatic colonization. Methods Seven patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representing the major BC subtypes were propagated into three distinct tissue microenvironments: subcutaneous, mammary fat pad and under the kidney capsule. Metastatic lesions were generated via systemic injection of tumor cells. Tumor samples were analysed using RNA- and exome sequencing, SNP-arrays and histopathology to assess subtype fidelity, genomic evolution, and clonal dynamics. Results A comprehensive, longitudinal multiomics analysis showed that tumors consistently maintain their molecular subtype, as well as their transcriptomic and genomic profiles, across different environments. No evidence of emerging ITH or subtype transitions was observed, regardless of the microenvironment. The transcriptomic adaptations observed in metastases and different implantation sites are limited and are associated primarily with hypoxia, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and invasion. Conclusions Our results suggest that invasive bladder cancers have a strong intrinsic tumor identity that is not easily reprogrammed by the microenvironment.

Cancers frequently exhibit DNA repair pathway alterations that contribute to their intrinsic genome instability. This, in part, facilitates a therapeutic window for many chemotherapeutic agents whose mechanisms of action often converge at the generation of a double-strand DNA break. The development of therapy resistance occurs through countless molecular mechanisms that promote tolerance to DNA damage, often by preventing break formation or increasing repair capacity. This review broadly discusses the DNA damaging mechanisms of action for different classes of chemotherapeutics, how avoidance and repair of double-strand breaks can promote resistance, and strategic directions for counteracting therapy resistance.">

 Introduction: Survival rates for patients with breast cancer have improved significantly with widespread screening and effective systemic therapies. However, patients who present with advanced nodal stage at diagnosis have higher rates of distant relapse and require more aggressive therapies than patients with pathologic N1 disease (pN1). Understanding the molecular alterations that occur in primary breast cancer (BC) that drive progression to a higher nodal stage (>pN1) could uncover potential therapeutic targets for patients with regionally metastatic BC. Given that epigenetic mechanisms represent that crucial layer of dynamic change that regulates genome-wide gene expression, we assessed the DNA methylation profiles of primary BC at various nodal stages. Methods: We conducted an exploratory study using a well-annotated, retrospective cohort of ER+/HER2- treatment-naive primary BC from patients with clinically positive nodes and complete pathologic nodal data treated at Duke University (n=49, 30 cases pN1 vs. 19 cases >pN1). DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded samples, and DNA methylation profiling was performed using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip v1 arrays. The ChAMP package was utilized to correct batch effect, and the Wilcoxon test was used to identify Differentially Methylated Sites (DMS). Tumor content purity was assessed using the LUMP algorithm and Gene Ontology enrichment of the DMSs was examined with the GOmeth tool. Data analysis and visualization were performed using the R packages ggplot2 (v. 3.4.4), circlize (v. 0.4.16), and gplots (v. 3.1.3.1), with data management facilitated by the tidyverse (v. 2.0.0) collection. Results: Tumor purity was similar between the two groups (p>0.05). The comparison revealed distinct DNA methylation patterns in 962 genomic regions between pN1 and >pN1 tumors (differential methylation > 15%, p<0.01); 683 regions were hypermethylated and 279 were hypomethylated in the >pN1 group. There was a significant enrichment of biological processes associated with morphogenesis among the hypermethylated sites, with 22 of the 43 affected molecular pathways linked to cellular morphogenesis. Additionally, epigenetic alterations were predominantly found in pathways related to the response to bone morphogenic protein (BMP). Expression-methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (emQTLs) were linked to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes in >pN1 tumors. Finally, higher methylation of the protocadherin cluster genes (PCDHGA) and regions encompassing DUSP6 and KRT7 genes were identified in tumors of higher nodal stage. These findings suggest inherent or acquired epigenetic alterations in primary BC associated with higher nodal stage. Conclusions: Understanding the mechanisms underlying lymph node invasion in breast cancer progression is crucial for improving the clinical management of patients with BC. This study indicates that ER+/HER2- primary tumors from patients with higher nodal involvement have an epigenetic predisposition to activate morphogenic differentiation and EMT more efficiently than patients with lower nodal involvement. Deeper insight into these alterations could contribute to more accurate prognostic tools, the development of novel therapeutic approaches, and potentially help avoid more aggressive axillary procedures.

        <tr id="Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is among the most frequently diagnosed cancer types, and affected patients frequently experience poor prognostic outcomes and high mortality rates. Many genomic studies of ESCC have been performed in recent years, yet the mutational mechanisms driving ESCC and their clinical implications remain incompletely understood. In this study, paired tumor and normal tissue samples from 22 patients with ESCC were used for whole genome sequencing-based analyses of genome-wide mutational events. These comprehensive analyses enabled the detection and characterization of various mutation subtypes in ESCC including somatic single-nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, copy number variations, structural variations, and circular extrachromosomal DNA. Of identified genes harboring non-silent mutations, TP53, NOTCH1, CSMD3, EP300, and FAM135B were the most frequently mutated genes in this study and they were annotated in the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census. With the exception of aging-related signatures, an APOBEC-associated mutational signature was the dominant mutational feature detected in ESCC samples, suggesting that APOBEC-mediated cytidine deamination is likely a major driver of mutations in this cancer type. Notably, our study also detected circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) events in these ESCC patient samples. The oncogenes COX6C, PVT1, and MMP12 as well as the oncogenic long non-coding RNA AZIN1-AS1 which were detected in ecDNA regions in these analyses may be associated with worse disease-free survival in ESCC patients.">

        <tr id="Aneuploidy is defined as the loss or gain of a whole chromosome or its region. Even at early stages of development, it usually leads to fatal consequences, including developmental defects/abnormalities and death. For a long time, it was believed that the disruption of gene balance results in pronounced effects at both the cellular and organismal levels, adversely affecting organism formation. It has been shown that the gene imbalance resulting from aneuploidy leads to proteotoxic and metabolic stress within the cell, reduced cell proliferation, genomic instability, oxidative stress, etc. However, some organisms have exhibited tolerance to aneuploidies, which may even confer adaptive advantages, such as antibiotic resistance in pathogenic fungal strains. A significant factor likely lies in the complexity of the tissue and organ organization of specific species. Polyploid organisms are generally more tolerant of aneuploidy, particularly those that have recently undergone whole-genome duplication. This review places special emphasis on the examination of sex chromosome aneuploidies in humans. In addition to primary effects, or cis effects (changes in the quantity of the transcripts of genes located on the aneuploid chromosome), aneuploidy can induce secondary or trans effects (changes in the expression levels of genes located on other chromosomes). The results of recent studies have prompted a reevaluation of the impact of aneuploidy on the structural-functional organization of the genome, transcriptome, and proteome of both the cell and the entire organism. Despite the fact that, in the cases of aneuploidy, the expression levels for most genes correlate with their altered copy numbers in the cell, there have been instances of dosage compensation, where the transcript levels of genes located on the aneuploid chromosome remained unchanged. The review presents findings from recent studies focused on compensatory mechanisms of dosage compensation that modify gene product quantities at post-transcriptional and post-translational levels, alleviating the negative effects of aneuploidy on cellular homeostasis. It also discusses the influence of extrachromosomal elements on the spatial organization of the genome and the changes in gene expression patterns resulting from their presence. Additionally, the review specifically examines cases of segmental aneuploidy and changes in copy number variants (CNVs) in the genome. Not only the implications of their composition are considered, but also their localization within the chromosome and in various compartments of the interphase nucleus. Addressing these questions could significantly contribute to enhancing cytogenomic diagnostics and establishing a necessary database for accurate interpretation of identified cases of segmental aneuploidy and CNVs in the genome.">

        <tr id="Guanine-rich DNA sequences have a propensity to form G-quadruplex structures. These structures play several important biological roles and are potential targets for anticancer drugs. However, no G-quadruplex-stabilizing agent has yet been approved for clinical use. Given that G-quadruplex stabilization is quite promising as a mechanism for novel anticancer therapies, it is crucial to elucidate its effects on healthy human cells. In our study, we modeled a potential human treatment using G4 -stabilizing agents and analyzed their effects on genome integrity, transcriptomic changes, and mitochondrial function focusing on non-cancerous cells to predict potential side effects of such treatments. We found that G-quadruplex stabilization does not compromise genome integrity. However, it can induce persistent alterations in the transcriptomic profile of human cells, including genes encoded on the mitochondrial genome. Notably, certain G-quadruplex-stabilizing agents triggered mitophagy in both human cells and Drosophila melanogaster. In summary, our findings indicate that while G-quadruplex stabilization does not cause genome instability, it may pose potential risks due to its long-term effects on transcription and its ability to induce mitophagy. Therefore, we recommend that all potential drug candidates be thoroughly evaluated for their ability to induce mitophagy and to promote cancer formation in animal models prior to clinical trials.

 Background:
 Endometrial cancer (EC) illustrates diverse nucleotide substitution and chromosomal re-arrangement signatures like other cancers. Namely, four molecular types are identified, replicative polymerases, microsatellite stable, copy number high/serous-like, and microsatellite instability characterized by mutations in mismatch repair genes. With advances in molecular techniques, early prediction of disease aggressiveness can be revealed using comprehension in ECs. Although few cell proliferative genes have been documented, a complete molecular landscaping is essential for effective treatment planning and decision-making. We report, the association between clinical disease status and corresponding molecular findings to establish the role of the latter in the early prediction of disease aggression in endometrial cancer.
 Methods:
 Retrospectively, we investigated the association of genomic mutational profiles of 40 endometrial cancer patients and their clinical disease status from PET scans and HPE reports. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) test was performed using a comprehensive genomic panel (CGP) OncoIndx assay.
 Results:
 Amongst 40 patients, 65% (n = 26/40) of patients had progressive and metastatic disease from PET scans and HPE reports indicative of disease aggressiveness. Almost 80% (n = 20/26) of the aggressive disease cohort were detected to have a minimum of one genomic alteration. Their mutational profiles showed a diverse spectrum of pathway-related aberrations from cell proliferation, progression, double-strand DNA (dsDNA) repair, mismatch repair (MMR), and tumor suppression constituting a total of 83 genomic alterations detected in the whole cohort. Further, the cell proliferation and dsDNA repair pathways exhibited the highest mutational load of 57.8% (n = 48/83) and 14.5% (n = 12/83) respectively in the cohort. Likewise, tumor suppressor genes constituted the lowest frequency at 6% (n = 5/83).In addition, five patients were detected with high MSI scores and one patient with an intermediate MSI score of which two MSI-high patients were also found to harbor MMR gene mutations (MSH3:p.K383Rfs*32, p.D403H, p.E456* and p.E512*, MSH6:p.F1088Sfs*2).
 Conclusions:
 Using CGP, we observed mutational frequencies of cell proliferation and dsDNA repair pathways that act as crucial markers for disease aggression in EC. We also noted that high MSI scores were not always concordant with mutations in the classical MMR genes and vice versa. This also indicates the individual significance of estimating MSI scores in these patients for clinical decision-making. Since the identified landscape of mutations well correlated with the disease states categorized from their clinical findings, they could potentially transform into molecular attributes for early prediction of progression and metastasis aiding treatment planning and decision making.

        <tr id="Background Colorectal carcinogenesis involves dynamic interactions between genetic susceptibility and cellular heterogeneity, yet current studies rarely disentangle causal genes from passive associations. While GWAS have mapped numerous risk loci, only a minority colocalize with eQTL/pQTL. A multi-omics framework combining single-cell transcriptomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and MR is urgently needed to resolve cell-type-specific drivers of colorectal cancer pathogenesis. Methods We integrated GWAS data, eQTL data, pQTL data, and single-cell RNA sequencing differential gene expression profiles from public databases. Subsequent batch Two-sample Mendelian randomization and further SMR analysis aimed to identify key genes in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Results Cluster analysis identified 4909 DEGs across various cell types. We discovered that 428 DEGs had a causal association with colorectal cancer through eQTL, of which 38 genes met the FDR statistical standards, and four of these genes (CTSF, PCSK7, LYZ, LMAN2L) also had causal associations through pQTL. SMR analysis confirmed the reliability of PCSK7 as a disease target. Conclusion By integrating single-cell data, transcriptomic data, proteomic data and GWAS data for MR analysis, we identified CTSF, PCSK7, LYZ, LMAN2L as potential targets for colorectal cancer.

 Background:
 Biliary tract cancers (BTC) are rare, highly aggressive malignancies with limited treatment options, leading to consistently poor outcomes. An improved understanding of BTC tumor evolution could inform enhanced screening strategies, identify useful prognostic markers, and discover novel therapeutic targets.
 Methods:
 We performed whole genome and transcriptome sequencing (WGTS) at high depth ( > 80X) on a prospective cohort of BTC tumors. After detecting mutations and mutational signatures, we developed two novel methods for driver identification and evolutionary reconstruction. First, we created new oncogene and tumor suppressor-specific models that integrate copy number profiles, structural variant breakends, and expression changes to distinguish structural drivers from neutral chromosomal rearrangements. Second, we applied population genetics techniques to fit demographic models to tumor allele frequencies across 20 paired primary and metastatic samples.
 Results:
 We analyzed 130 tumor samples from 110 patients, representing the largest BTC whole-genome cohort to date. We identified hypermutated tumors (50-150 mutations/mb) with distinct etiologies, including mismatch repair deficiency, platinum exposure, tobacco use, and aristolochic acid-related damage, the latter of which was associated with response to immunotherapy. Ourintegrated-driver approach identified an association between selection on
 RAD23A
 and an increased structural variant load, resulting in a tandem-duplicator-like mutational phenotype. This also revealed an underappreciated impact of
 SMAD4
 in BTC, which is inactivated through multiple mutation types in 12%. Notably,
 BAP1
 mutations occurred in 24% of cases, including 4% that were inactivated through deletion of the
 BAP1
 promoter that lowered transcript expression, a previously undescribed mechanism. By pairing clinical data to the genomics, we observed a co-occurrence of
 BAP1
 mutations and
 FGFR2
 fusions in small-duct, mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. These mutations were mutually exclusive with
 TP53
 mutations, which were enriched in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Finally, our novel method for subclonal population reconstruction on paired samples illuminated recent tumor evolutionary dynamics and identified an
 ARID1B
 fusion with a potential role in metastasis.
 Conclusions:
 This study uncovered novel genomic mechanisms underlying the evolutionary origins of BTC beyond those previously identified with exome and panel sequencing, highlighting the value of WGTS. These results highlight the complex genomic heterogeneity of BTC, with potential implications for precision therapy.

        <tr id="Background The incidence and mortality of endometrial cancer (EC) is on the rise. Eighty-five percent of ECs depend on estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) for proliferation, but little is known about its transcriptional regulation in these tumors. Results We generate epigenomics, transcriptomics, and Hi-C datastreams in healthy and tumor endometrial tissues, identifying robust ERα reprogramming and profound alterations in 3D genome organization that lead to a gain of tumor-specific enhancer activity during EC development. Integration with endometrial cancer risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms and whole-genome sequencing data from primary tumors and metastatic samples reveals a striking enrichment of risk variants and non-coding somatic mutations at tumor-enriched ERα sites. Through machine learning-based predictions and interaction proteomics analyses, we identify an enhancer mutation which alters 3D genome conformation, impairing recruitment of the transcriptional repressor EHMT2/G9a/KMT1C, thereby alleviating transcriptional repression of ESR1 in EC. Conclusions In summary, we identify a complex genomic-epigenomic interplay in EC development and progression, altering 3D genome organization to enhance expression of the critical driver ERα.

        <tr id="Recent advances of cancer immunotherapy have identified neoantigens as essential targets for personalized treatments. However, since neoantigens are generally unique in individual cancers, neoantigen therapies that are more broadly applicable are eagerly awaited. Shared neoantigens, derived from recurrent mutations found across multiple patients, are considered to be a challenging, but promising approach. Here we analyzed shared frameshift neoantigens derived from frameshift indels in TCGA exome sequencing data and identified 760 possible recurrent frameshift mutation clusters (FSCs) that share frameshifted open reding frames and premature stop codons. Among them, we investigated FSCs in the APC gene (APC-F2-1472* and APC-F3-1512*) and identified HLA-A*24:02-restricted frameshift neoantigen peptides that elicited specific CD8+ T cell responses. Subsequently we identified their corresponding T cell receptor (TCR) sequences and generated genetically-engineered T cells expressing these APC frameshift neoantigen-specific TCRs. These engineered T cells specifically recognized target cells presenting these neoantigens and cytotoxic activity against them, supporting the therapeutic potential of targeting APC frameshift neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy. This study provides compelling evidence for the development of neoantigen-based therapies targeting common frameshift peptides, offering a promising approach for more effective, relatively broadly applicable immunotherapeutic strategies that could benefit a subset population of cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for twelve percent of all breast cancer cases, with a survival rate around ten percent lower than ER+/PR+ positive breast cancers. There are limited therapeutic options as these tumors do not respond to hormonal therapy or HER2-targeted treatments. We hypothesized that new insights into pathogenic mechanisms in TNBC can be obtained from studying epigenetic alterations through Hi-C (genome-wide chromosome conformation capture) data analysis.We developed a computational strategy that captured key properties of chromatin conformation while incorporating statistical measures of interaction significance. This model addresses limitations in Hi-C data analysis without relying on predefined features like TADs and compartments. We applied this model to Hi-C and RNA-seq data from TNBC patients, representing the data as multilayer networks to identify genome-wide properties of the TNBC 3D genome.Our network-based analysis revealed distinct chromatin interaction patterns in TNBC compared to healthy contralateral controls. Hi-C data can distinguish interaction patterns related to diseased phenotypes or interaction patterns with potential to exert regulatory effects instead of incidental contacts, but some apparently random interactions may also support important genome regulatory activities.Our findings demonstrate that network-based Hi-C analysis can capture the genome-wide complexity of chromatin interactions in TNBC. This integrative approach provides new insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying TNBC pathogenesis and contributes to the advancement of analysis methods for future investigations into novel therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Genomic instability has been increasingly recognized over the past decade as a fundamental driver of cancer initiation and progression, largely owing to its association with specific genes and cellular mechanisms that offer therapeutic potential. However, a comprehensive molecular framework that captures the interconnected processes underlying this phenomenon remains elusive. In this study, we focused on polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a key cell cycle regulator frequently overexpressed in diverse human tumors, to reconstruct a regulatory network that consolidates pre-existing biological knowledge exclusively related to pathways involved in genome stability maintenance and cancer. The resulting model integrates nine biological processes, 1030 reactions, and 716 molecular species to form a literature-supported network in which PLK1 serves as a central regulatory node. However, rather than depicting an isolated PLK1-centric system, this network reflects a broader and more complex architecture of interrelated genomic instability mechanisms. As expected, the simulations reproduced known behaviors associated with PLK1 dysregulation, reinforcing the well-established role of the kinase in genome destabilization. Importantly, this model also enables the exploration of additional, less-characterized dynamics, including the potential involvement of genes such as kif2c, incenp, and other regulators of chromosomal segregation and DNA repair, which appear to contribute to instability events downstream of PLK1. While these findings are grounded in mechanistic simulations and require further experimental validation, gene expression and survival analyses across tumor types support their clinical relevance by linking them to poor prognosis in specific cancers. Overall, the model provides a systemic and adaptable foundation for studying PLK1-related genomic instability, enabling both the reinforcement of known mechanisms and discovery of candidate genes and circuits that may drive tumorigenesis through compromised genome integrity across distinct cancer contexts.">

        <tr id="Essential transcription and cell cycle progression controllers are CDKs, whose dysregulation is a defining trait of many human cancers. CDKs have grown to be very crucial therapeutic targets in cancer. Although traditional CDK inhibitors have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy, they frequently encounter limitations due to resistance mechanisms and off-target effects. Recent developments in targeted protein degradation, like proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glues, offer creative ways to destroy CDK proteins specifically. These techniques reduce scaffolding activities and slow down kinase activity, hence more completely blocking oncogenic CDK signaling. This paper highlights the clinical and preclinical developments of PROTACs and molecular glues, investigates the current CDK-targeting therapeutic landscape, and studies the molecular basis of CDK dysregulation in cancer. We also address their benefits over conventional inhibitors, current issues, and possibilities for inclusion into precision oncology. These new approaches taken together represent a change in CDK-targeted cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Objective DDX17, an ATP-dependent RNA/DNA helicase, is implicated in the regulation of RNA metabolism and has been linked to tumorigenesis and metastasis in various cancers. While studies have explored the role of DDX17 in specific cancers, further research is needed to understand its mechanisms across different cancer types. Methods We leveraged several public databases, including TIMER, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), to investigate DDX17 mRNA expression across 33 types of tumors. The GEPIA2 database was utilized to assess the impact of DDX17 on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with these tumors. Additionally, we employed cBioPortal to examine DDX17 gene alterations in various tumor tissues. Further analysis was conducted using the R language to explore the correlation between DDX17 and a range of clinical features, including tumor microenvironment (TME), immune regulatory genes, immune checkpoints, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA methylation, RNA methylation, and drug sensitivity. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was also applied to elucidate the molecular mechanisms mediated by DDX17. Results DDX17 showed significant differences in expression between cancer and normal tissues. Expression of DDX17 was associated with patient prognosis, TMB, MSI, and drug sensitivity in certain cancers. DDX17 is additionally involved in modulating immune functions and influencing the tumor microenvironment. Further analysis of DDX17 mutation sites and types showed that the mutation frequency was highest in endometrial cancer and the major mutations of DDX17 were missense mutations. Conclusion These findings indicated that DDX17 may be considered a potential prognostic biomarker and a promising target for novel immunotherapeutic approaches in cancer treatment.

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common cancer worldwide, is one of the deadliest cancers. CRC is known as a cold tumor, characterized by a low immune response that makes it difficult for immune cells to infiltrate and exhibits strong resistance to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition. This restricted response is largely attributed to signature gene mutations including mismatch repair (MMR) genes, KRAS, BRAF, APC, and TP53, which are also the main oncogenes in CRC. Mutated signature genes continuously upregulate abnormal signaling pathways, leading to excessive proliferation, cancer progression, and metastasis. Furthermore, it reorganizes the tumor microenvironment (TME) by recruiting immunosuppressive cells. However, the mutation can produce neoantigens that can provoke an immune response, making it a potential target for immunotherapy. In particular, cancer vaccines that leverage the strong neoantigenic properties of these mutations are considered promising for overcoming immune resistance and eliciting anti-tumor responses. In this review, we will describe signature gene mutations in CRC and focus on cancer vaccines targeting these mutations as potential therapies for CRC.">

        <tr id="Chromosomal instability (CIN), a characteristic feature of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), drives tumor aggressiveness and therapy resistance, presenting an intractable problem in cancer treatment. CIN leads to constitutive stimulation of the innate immune cGAS–STING pathway, which has been typically linked to anti-tumor immunity. However, despite the high CIN burden in EAC, the cGAS– STING pathway remains largely intact. To address this paradox, we developed novel esophageal cancer models, including a CIN-isogenic model, discovering myeloid-attracting chemokines – with the chemokine CXCL8 (IL-8) as a prominent hit – as conserved CIN-driven targets in EAC. Using high-resolution multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy, we quantified the extent of ongoing cGAS-activating CIN in human EAC tumors by measuring cGAS-positive micronuclei in tumor cells, validated by orthogonal whole-genome sequencing-based CIN metrics. By coupling in situ CIN assessment with single-nucleus RNA sequencing and multiplex immunophenotypic profiling, we found tumor cell-intrinsic innate immune activation and intratumoral myeloid cell inflammation as phenotypic consequences of CIN in EAC. Additionally, we identified increased tumor cell-intrinsic CXCL8 expression in CINhigh EAC, accounting for the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Using a novel signature of CIN, termed CINMN, which captures ongoing CIN-associated gene expression, we confirm poor patient outcomes in CINhigh tumors with signs of aberrantly rewired cGAS–STING pathway signaling. Together, our findings help explain the counterintuitive maintenance and expression of cGAS–STING pathway components in aggressive, CINhigh tumors and emphasize the need to understand the contribution of CIN to the shaping of a pro-tumor immune landscape. Therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting the cGAS-driven inflammation axis may be instrumental in improving patient outcomes in this aggressive cancer.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be a major contributor to global cancer-related mortality, with KRAS and NRAS oncogenic mutations playing a pivotal role in tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance. These genetic alterations drive uncontrolled proliferation and modulate responses to targeted treatments, significantly influencing clinical outcomes. This review examines the prevalence and prognostic implications of KRAS and NRAS mutations, with particular attention paid to the Venezuelan population. Reported frequencies in Venezuela (13–23% for KRAS and 1.6–2.6% for NRAS) are markedly lower than global averages (36–45% for KRAS), a discrepancy potentially attributable to population-specific genetic variations or methodological constraints of conventional sequencing techniques, which may lack sensitivity for variant detection. The presence of RAS mutations is a well-established biomarker of resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, necessitating alternative treatment regimens for affected patients. Although novel agents such as KRAS G12C inhibitors exhibit therapeutic potential, their efficacy remains under investigation in clinical trials, highlighting the need for regionally tailored drug development and improved access to innovative therapies in Venezuela. Beyond proliferative signaling, KRAS-mediated oncogenesis involves metabolic adaptation, angiogenic activation, and immune system evasion, underscoring its multifaceted role in CRC progression. Advanced molecular diagnostic techniques, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis, have significantly improved the detection of oncogenic mutations, offering higher sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional methods. However, their widespread adoption in resource-limited settings remains hindered by infrastructural, economic, and technical barriers.">

 Background:
 The development of resistance is the one of the reason for ineffective treatment of soft tissue sarcomas (STSs). The search for new molecular-biological targets, both for the personalized selection of novel targeted drugs and for predicting chemoresistance of STSs to individual antitumor agents and their combinations, is a pressing task.
 Methods:
 In this study, an experimental in vitro chemoresistance analysis, whole-genome sequencing, and single-cell sequencing of tumors in patients (N = 9) with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas were performed. Chemotherapy resistance indices were determined for the obtained samples.
 Results:
 Whole-genome DNA sequencing yielded data on the type and frequency of somatic mutations in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, and driver genes of carcinogenesis were identified, among which the most frequently occurring were FCGBP, PARP4, TP53, RGPD3, PDE4DIP, and RB1. Correlations between the presence of genetic alterations and the response to chemotherapy in the in vitro test were sought. Thus, in samples resistant to the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide, the presence of mutations in the PEG3, USP8, NT5C3A, and WAS genes was characteristic. Bioinformatic analysis of single-cell transcriptome sequencing data, aimed at characterizing the population composition and transcriptomic landscape of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma cells, revealed 15 normal and 8 tumor cell populations. Among the populations of normal cells, the following clusters were identified: M2 and M1 macrophages, T-cells, matrix-remodeling fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, monocytes, stromal cells, endothelial cells, and osteoblasts. Among tumor cells, clusters of proliferating cells, hypoxic cells, matrix-interacting cells, and tumor cells with a stem-like phenotype were identified. The most common clusters in all samples were M2 macrophages, endothelial cells, and one of the clusters of tumor cells interacting with the matrix. Comparison of the expression profiles of cells from patients with different responses to chemotherapy allowed identification and characterization of clusters associated with chemosensitivity and chemoresistance. These included clusters of macrophages, tumor cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. In addition, genes common to all clusters associated with resistant samples were identified (ARGLU1, JUND, TNNT3, RHOB, CCNL2, LENG8, LUC7L3, KLF9, RSRP1, RNF213, SERPINE1, CDK5RAP3).
 Conclusions:
 The data obtained in this study will expand the understanding of the pathogenesis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas and the mechanisms underlying their development of chemotherapy resistance. In the future, this will serve as the basis for creating a test system to evaluate the expression levels of genes whose activation/repression is associated with the development of drug resistance in STSs.

 Sex differences in breast cancer (BC) lead to distinct clinical and molecular characteristics. Sex-associated heterogeneity relies intricately on the oncogenic properties of cancer cells and multicellular interactions in tumor microenvironments. Here we conducted a multiomic analysis encompassing single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and large-scale histological analysis, combined with genetic and pharmacological perturbations to systematically develop a high-resolution and spatially resolved map of intratumoral expression heterogeneity in male breast cancer (MBC). Among the malignant cells, we identify 9 consensus meta-programs (MPs, for example, estrogen response and interferon response), each consisting of dozens of genes that are coordinately upregulated in subpopulations of cells within MBC. Of these, MP5 exhibits significant male bias, characterized by aberrant activation of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling pathway, inducing endocrine therapy resistance in MBC. Bidirectional interactions between MP5 malignant cells and immunosuppressive cancer-associated fibroblasts form an immune exclusionary microenvironment mediated by LRBA. Collectively, our study highlights the endocrine therapy resistant and immunosuppressive role of LRBA in MBC, and these findings may provide insights into the molecular features of MBC and facilitate the development of sex-specifical treatment strategies.

        <tr id="Evolution and outgrowth of drug-resistant cancer cells is a common cause of treatment failure. Patients with leukemic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (L-CTCL) have a poor prognosis due to development of drug-resistance and severe bacterial infections. Here, we show that most L-CTCL patients harbor multiple genetically distinct subclones that express an identical clonal antigen receptor but display distinct phenotypes and functional properties. These co-existing malignant subclones exhibit differences in tissue homing, metabolism, and cytokine expression, and respond differently to extrinsic factors like Staphylococcus (S.)aureus and cancer drugs. Indeed, while S. aureus toxins selectively enhance activation and proliferation of certain subclones, these responsive subclones are also the most intrinsically sensitive to cancer drugs when the stimuli are removed. Consequently, although divergent evolution of malignant subclones drives aggressiveness, adaptability and drug-resistance, by removing extrinsic stimuli and mapping malignant subclones, we can expose inherent vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the treatment of these cancers.">

 Background:
 Children with high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma (NB) need improved therapies, and recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, such as
 MYCN
 oncogene amplification, represent candidate therapeutic targets.
 MYCN
 amplification and increased
 MYCN
 expression drive deregulated hyper-transcription that leads to development and growth of NB tumors, and
 MYCN
 amplifications, which can be found both within the linear genome (HSR) and on circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), are associated with significantly worse survival rates for children with NB.
 MYCN
 overexpression has been linked to an increase in replication stress (RS), and RS and subsequent genome instability are important drivers of tumor initiation and progression. Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a non-essential DNA replication enzyme, was identified as a synthetic lethal target in
 BRCA1
 /
 2
 -deficient cancers via induction of RS. Recent success of targeting RS-elevated cancers with replication enzyme inhibitors opens a new avenue to target
 MYCN
 -amplified NB.
 Methods:
 Associations of gene expression with patient survival and prognostic features were performed on available neuroblastoma tumor databases using the R2 Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform. The efficacy of FEN1 inhibition was assessed using live cell imaging and cell viability assays, comparing results in
 MYCN
 -amplified to -nonamplified NB cells and in NB cells with inducible
 MYCN
 expression and repression. Mechanisms of cell death and impacts on replication stress in cells treated with FEN1 inhibitors were evaluated by Western blots.
 Results:
 We have found that
 FEN1
 expression levels are associated wtih NB patient outcomes and with features of high-risk disease, including tumor stage and
 MYCN
 amplification. FEN1 inhibition was effective against NB cells and was significantly more effective in
 MYCN
 -amplified NB cells causing reduced cell growth and viability. Increased
 MYCN
 expression also led to increased sensitivity to FEN1 inhibition, and reduced MYCN expression reduced sensitivity. FEN1 inhibition led to the induction of apoptosis but not necroptosis in NB cells and responses to FEN1 inhibition were associated with markers of replication stress, including activation of the ATR-CHK1 and ATM-CHK2 pathways.
 Conclusions:
 We have discovered that
 MYCN
 -amplified NB cells are hypersensitive to FEN1 inhibition, suggesting that FEN1 inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for children with high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma.

        <tr id="In cancer genomics, there is the realization that some very frequently mutated genes like TP53 or KRAS are extremely hard to approach from a therapeutic perspective. In the realm of cancer treatment, the development of agents capable of transforming these alterations into actionable targets would be like capturing unicorns. These unicorns of oncology-drugs targeting undruggable targets that span various cancer types-offer an exciting opportunity for the development of histology-agnostic therapies. Among these, recent developments in targeting TP53 mutations, KRAS alterations, and MTAP loss mark pivotal advancements for innovative treatment strategies. TP53 mutations, which occur in nearly every cancer type, are central to tumorigenesis and contribute to resistance against conventional therapies. KRAS mutations, especially in cancers like pancreatic and lung cancers, are notoriously difficult to target but are now yielding promising therapeutic avenues. Similarly, MTAP is frequently deleted in cancers such as lung, pancreatic, and mesothelioma and plays a critical role in cellular metabolism and epigenetics, making its loss a significant vulnerability in tumor cells. Recent developments in drug discovery provide a broad foundation for the clinical testing of drugs that target common mechanisms across diverse tumor types, offering hope for a more universal approach to cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a diverse collection of malignant tumors that originate in the bile ducts. Mitochondria, the energy converters in eukaryotic cells, contain circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) which has a greater mutation rate than nuclear DNA. Heteroplasmic variations in mtDNA may suggest an increased risk of cancer-related mortality, serving as a potential prognostic marker. In this study, we investigated the mtDNA variations of five CCA cell lines, including KKU-023, KKU-055, KKU-100, KKU213A, and KKU-452 and compared them to the non-tumor cholangiocyte MMNK-1 cell line. We used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), a long-read sequencing technology capable of synthesizing the whole mitochondrial genome, which facilitates enhanced identification of complicated rearrangements in mitogenomics. The analysis revealed a high frequency of SNVs and INDELs, particularly in the D-loop, MT-RNR2, MT-CO1, MT-ND4, and MT-ND5 genes. Significant mutations were detected in all CCA cell lines, with particularly notable non-synonymous SNVs such as m.8462T > C in KKU-023, m.9493G > A in KKU-055, m.9172C > A in KKU-100, m.15024G > C in KKU-213A, m.12994G > A in KKU-452, and m.13406G > A in MMNK-1, which demonstrated high pathogenicity scores. The presence of these mutations suggests the potential for mitochondrial dysfunction and CCA progression. Analysis of mtDNA structural variants (SV) revealed significant variability among the cell lines. We identified 208 SVs in KKU-023, 185 SVs in KKU-055, 231 SVs in KKU-100, 69 SVs in KKU-213A, 172 SVs in KKU-452, and 217 SVs in MMNK-1. These SVs included deletions, duplications, and inversions, with the highest variability observed in KKU-100 and the lowest in KKU-213A. Our results underscore the diverse mtDNA mutation landscape in CCA cell lines, highlighting the potential impact of these mutations on mitochondrial function and CCA cell line progression. Future research is required to investigate the functional impacts of these variants, their interactions with nuclear DNA in CCA, and their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Mutations in the p53 gene are frequently observed in various cancers, prompting the initiation of efforts to restore p53 function as a therapeutic approach several decades ago. Nevertheless, only a limited number of drug development initiatives have progressed to late-stage clinical trials, and to date, no p53-targeted therapies have received approval in the USA or Europe. This situation can be attributed primarily to the characteristics of p53 as a nuclear transcription factor, which lacks the conventional features associated with drug targets and has historically been considered “undruggable”. In recent years, however, several promising strategies have emerged, including the enhanced iterations of previous approaches and novel techniques aimed at targeting proteins that have traditionally been considered undruggable. There is a growing interest in small molecules that can restore the tumor-suppressive functions of mutant p53 proteins, and the development of drugs specifically designed for particular p53 mutation types is currently underway. Other approaches aim to deplete mutant p53 or exploit vulnerabilities associated with its expression. Additionally, genetic therapy strategy and approaches have rekindled interest. Advances in mutant p53 biology, compound mechanisms, treatment modalities, and nanotechnology have opened up new avenues for p53-based therapies. However, significant challenges remain in clinical development. This review reassesses the progress in targeting p53-mutant cancers, discusses the obstacles in translating these approaches into effective therapies, and highlights p53-based therapies via nanotechnology.">

        <tr id="Among the human leukemia cell lines described in the literature, only the MDS-L cell line has been definitively established from a patient during the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) phase of the disease. However, the limited studies on its genomic complexity have restricted its applicability as an in vitro model for MDS. Here, we aimed to better characterize the chromosomal and genetic alterations of MDS-L. A comprehensive approach was employed combining conventional G banding, multicolor FISH (M-FISH), SNP arrays with the novel Optical Genome Mapping (OGM) technology. In addition, the mutational landscape was defined using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). G-banding revealed two karyotypically distinct cell populations, both exhibiting complex karyotypes. Using G-banding and OGM, we identified previously undescribed structural alterations, including der(1)t(1;7)(q11;q11.2), del(1)(q11), der(4)t(4;5)(p16;q11.2), i(5)(p10), der(6)t(6;15)(p21.3;q15), i(8)(q10), der(9)t(9;10)(q34;p11.21), der(19)t(6;19)(p13;p22) and i(22)(q10). Both OGM and SNP microarray analyses detected multiple copy number variants and regions of homozygosity. Chromosome breakpoints were precisely defined by OGM, allowing the identification of gene disruption events. Moreover, M-FISH technique validated the origins of additional chromosomal material observed in the karyotype, identified cryptic rearrangements, and distinguished the two clonal populations within the cell line. Finally, NGS revealed mutations in CEBPA, NRAS, TET2 and TP53 genes associated with MDS pathology. This multi-technique approach has enabled a precise characterization of the MDS-L cell line’s genomic complexity, highlighting the unique contributions of each technique in uncovering various genetic alterations and establishing a valuable resource for mechanistic studies and pre-clinical drug development.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a deadly disease known for its genetic heterogeneity. LTR12C is an endogenous retrovirus-derived regulator of pro-apoptotic genes and is normally silenced by epigenetic regulation. In this study, we found that the treatment of two glioblastoma cell lines, T98-G and U87-MG, with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors activated LTR12C expression. Combined treatment with these epigenetic drugs exerted a synergistic action on the LTR12C activation in both cell lines, while treatment with each drug as a single agent had a far weaker effect. A strong induction of the expression of the TP63 gene was seen in both cell lines, with the pro-apoptotic isoform GTA-p63 accounting for most of this increase. Coherently, downstream targets of p63, such as p21 and PUMA, were also induced by the combined treatment. Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction in the GBM cell growth and viability following the dual DNMT/HDAC inhibition. These findings reveal that the reactivation of LTR12C expression has the potential to modulate survival pathways in glioblastoma and provide information regarding possible epigenetic mechanisms that can be used to treat this deadly disease.">

        <tr id="The TP53 gene encodes the critical tumor suppressor p53, which is involved in the regulation of cell cycle control, apoptosis, and genomic stability. In cancer biology, p53 holds an elevated position because high mutation rates in the TP53 gene across human cancers lead to abnormal p53 protein. This would allow limitless replication of genetically damaged cells with malignant potential and so facilitate tumorigenesis. Normally referred to as the “guardian of the genome,” this protein assumes a central role in different cellular functions spanning metabolism through cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis to DNA repair mechanisms. Its significance extends beyond tumor suppression because it controls metabolic pathways that are central to maintaining homeostasis under normal physiological conditions. The normal functions of p53 as a tumor suppressor are abrogated by mutations; indeed, many such mutant forms act as oncogenes themselves when expressed in cancer cells. The review paper presents information from recent scientific investigations on the chemical structure of p53 protein and its mutations with a discussion on implications for cancer treatment. It also integrates various research findings to clarify the clinical effects of the p53 gene, especially in breast cancer and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and looks into changing treatment plans that focus on p53 problems.">

        <tr id="Extensively studied over the past four decades, the TP53 gene has emerged as a pivotal watchman in cellular defense and a key factor in cancer biology. TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human malignancies, 50% of which carry alterations to it. Initially, the functions of p53 were thought to be restricted to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. With time, however, a growing number of functions have been discovered, illustrating p53's role as a master switch between any cellular stress and cellular or multicellular responses that contribute to its anti-tumor activity. Indeed, the peculiar landscape of TP53 mutations and its high heterogeneity are linked both to the structure of the protein and its ubiquitous function in regulating cellular homeostasis. Mutations in p53 are associated with poor response to therapy and shorter survival in most cancer types, and the diagnosis of p53 mutations is currently used to improve case management in some types of leukemia and lymphoma. Although TP53 has been defined as a tumor suppressor gene, overexpressed mutated p53 variants found in human tumors are defined as dominant oncogenes with a potential gain of function, which makes the gene a very attractive target for developing new cancer treatments. Beyond its role in cancer, our review also highlights TP53's significance in non-neoplastic conditions, such as bone marrow failure syndromes and certain developmental disorders, where chronic p53 activation plays a crucial role in cellular stress responses, demonstrating its broader biological importance.">

        <tr id="Background T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a relatively rare hematological malignancy, characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature T lymphoblasts and associated with a generally unfavorable prognosis. Our previous research has demonstrated that decreased mitochondrial activity is associated with the aggressiveness of T-ALL tumors. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and its contribution to treatment resistance remain largely elusive. Methods We have built up the largest known T-ALL tumor bank, with a median follow-up of 32 months, including our transcriptomic data from 79 newly sequenced tumors that adds to the 54 publicly accessible samples. Computational analyses and a series of functional assays were performed to investigate the molecular links between altered mitochondrial activity and drug resistance. Results The transcriptomic analysis revealed that down-regulation of mitochondrial activity is a potent driver of ABCB1 activation, a gene strongly associated with multidrug resistance. In tumors with low mitochondrial activity, the impaired fatty acids β-oxidation leads to intracellular lipid accumulation, which is directly involved in ABCB1 activation. Indeed, our data show that lipid neo-synthesis and accumulation promotes the activation of lipogenic transcription factors, liver X receptors (LXRs), which act as drivers of ABCB1 expression. Tumor data analyses confirmed that high ABCB1 expression in tumour samples is indeed associated with reduced mitochondrial gene expression, lipid droplet enrichment, increased tumour aggressiveness, and significantly shorter patient survival. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that reduced mitochondrial activity drives multidrug resistance in adult T-ALL via lipid-mediated activation of ABCB1. These findings enhance our understanding of the biology of aggressive T-ALL and provide insight into mechanisms of resistance to conventional chemotherapy. Consequently, we propose that targeting de novo lipogenesis and restricting dietary fats, such as caprylic acid, may help overcome treatment resistance in patients with T-ALL exhibiting low mitochondrial activity.

        <tr id="Human SAMD9 and SAMD9L are duplicated genes that encode innate immune proteins restricting poxviruses and lentiviruses, such as HIV, and implicated in life-threatening genetic diseases and cancer. Here, we combined structural similarity searches, phylogenetics and population genomics with experimental assays of SAMD9/9L functions to resolve the evolutionary and functional dynamics of these immune proteins, spanning from prokaryotes to primates. We discovered structural analogs of SAMD9/9L in the anti-bacteriophage defense system Avs, resulting from convergent evolution. Further, the predicted nuclease active site was conserved in bacterial analogs and was essential for cell death functions, suggesting a fundamental role in defense across different life kingdoms. Despite this ancestral immunity, we identified genomic signatures of evolutionary arms-races in mammals, with remarkable gene copy number variations targeted by natural selection. We further unveiled that the absence of SAMD9 in bonobos corresponds to a recent gene loss still segregating in the population. Finally, we found that chimp and bonobo SAMD9Ls have enhanced anti-HIV-1 functions, and that bonobo-specific SAMD9L polymorphisms confer increased anti-HIV-1 activity to human SAMD9L without compromising its effect on cell translation. These SAMD9/9L adaptations likely resulted from strong viral selective pressures, including by primate lentiviruses, and could contribute to lentiviral resistance in bonobos. Altogether, this study elucidates the interplay between ancient immune convergence across kingdoms and species-specific adaptations within the Avs9 and SAMD9/9L antiviral shared immunity. Significance statement The SAMD9 gene family encodes antiviral factors of poxviruses and lentiviruses/HIV and is implicated in genetic diseases. Here, we found strong structural similarity with proteins from the Avs anti-bacteriophage system and uncovered ancient functional convergence in immune strategies between prokaryotes and metazoans. Within mammals, and more importantly in primates, we describe a highly dynamic evolutionary history of the SAMD9 gene family that underwent adaptive episodic gene losses. Unlike humans and chimps, some bonobos lack the SAMD9 gene entirely. Bonobos and chimps also possess unique variants of SAMD9L enhancing anti-HIV-1 activity without compromising cell functions, suggesting super-restrictors. This could also participate in shaping SIVcpz evolution and contribute to the absence of lentivirus-infected bonobos. Overall, the seeming dichotomy between the ancient evolutionary convergence in different kingdoms and recent functional adaptation within primates highlights the arms-races between key immune defense systems and viruses. This study paves the way for evolutionary medicine, where evolutionary-based discoveries may have application to human health, providing a deeper understanding of how the immune system adapts to fight viral infections over billion years of evolution.">

        <tr id="Elucidating the role of somatic mutations in cancer, healthy tissues, and aging depends on methods that can accurately characterize somatic mosaicism across different cell types, as well as assay their impact on cellular function. Current technologies to study cell-type-specific somatic mutations within tissues are low-throughput. We developed Duplex-Multiome, incorporating duplex consensus sequencing to accurately identify somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNV) from the same nucleus simultaneously analyzed for single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) and RNA-seq (snRNA-seq). By introducing strand-tagging into the construction of snATAC-seq libraries, duplex sequencing reduces sequencing error by >10,000-fold while eliminating artifactual mutational signatures. When applied to 98%/2% mixed cell lines, Duplex-Multiome identified sSNVs present in 2% of cells with 92% precision and accurately captured known sSNV mutational spectra, while revealing unexpected subclonal lineages. Duplex-Multiome of > 51,400 nuclei from postmortem brain tissue captured sSNV burdens and spectra across all major brain cell types and subtypes, including those difficult to assay by single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS). This revealed for the first time that diverse neuronal and glial cell types show distinct rates and patterns of age-related mutation, while also directly discovering developmental cell lineage relationships. Duplex-Multiome identified clonal sSNVs occurring at increased rates in glia of certain aged brains, as well as clonal sSNVs that correlated with changes in expression of nearby genes, in both neurotypical and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) individuals, directly demonstrating that somatic mutagenesis can contribute to gene expression phenotypes. Duplex-Multiome can be easily adopted into the 10X Multiome protocol and will bridge somatic mosaicism to a wide range of phenotypic readouts across cell types and tissues.">

 Although genetic variants associated with bladder cancer (BCa) risk have been identified through hypothesis-driven and genome-wide association studies, a systematic understanding of BCa genetic susceptibility at the gene and pathway levels remains to be achieved.



 In this 2-stage functional genomics study, we used 5 independent tools for genome-wide gene mapping and ranking based on BCa genome-wide association studies summary statistics, followed by a meta-analysis of gene-level significance p values, to obtain a consensus gene ranking in terms of association with BCa. Subsequently, we performed preranked gene-set enrichment analysis to identify the functional pathways involved in BCa genetic susceptibility. Joint analysis with gene-set enrichment analysis, based on somatic alteration frequency, was performed to explore the pathway-level relationships between genetic susceptibility and somatic alterations in BCa.



 Other than the well-known BCa genes (such as FGFR3, MYC, TERT, CCNE1, and TP63), we additionally prioritized a set of novel genes likely to be genetically implicated in BCa development, including SETD2, a possible tumor suppressor gene involved in chromatin remodeling. We further demonstrated convergence between genetic associations and somatic alterations at both the gene (eg, FGFR3 and TERT) and pathway levels (eg, cell cycle and chromatin modification), as well as functional ontologies specifically implicated in germline predisposition to BCa (eg, CD8/TCR signaling, immune checkpoints, and cytokine signaling).



 We identified several novel genes associated with BCa and demonstrated that genetic variants contribute to the development of BCa by affecting antitumor immunity, response to toxic exposure, and RNA and protein homeostasis and synergizing with somatic alterations in various cancer-related pathways.

 Chromosome arm-level aneuploidies (CAAs) are a common consequence of genomic instability during the evolution of solid tumor and often associated with metastasis and therapy resistance. In breast cancer, chromosome arms 1q and 8q are the frequent amplified regions for CAAs. This study aims to investigate whether critical genes amplified in genomic regions with CAAs contribute to the pathophysiology in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We established multiple long-term culturable TNBC patient-derived cells (PDCs) using spheroid culture technique, which is favorable for the enrichment of cell population with cancer stemness. We performed a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation study for histone H3K27ac and super-enhancer analysis in these TNBC PDCs and cell lines. Super-enhancer analysis revealed that 8q is a substantial chromosomal region with a high density of super-enhancers. Among genes in the vicinity of 8q super-enhancers, we identified that MYB proto-oncogene like 1 (MYBL1) is a transcription factor with high abundance in TNBC PDCs as well as in basal-like BT549 cells. In TCGA breast cancer database, 8q gain is a common genomic feature in MYBL1 gene-amplified breast cancer tissues and MYBL1 expression is substantially correlated with 8q-related genes and proliferation-related genes like MKI67 and BUB1. In TNBC PDCs and cell lines, we showed that MYBL1-specific siRNAs significantly repressed TNBC cell proliferation and migration. RNA sequencing analysis in TNBC cells revealed that MYBL1 silencing substantially downregulated genes involved in the transcription machinery such as nuclear envelope, chromatin dynamics, and DNA replication. In immunohistochemical analysis of clinical TNBC tissues from a Japanese cohort, we showed that a positive MYBL1 immunoreactivity (IR) was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS). Among candidate MYBL1 targets, we demonstrated that NCAPH, a subunit of condensin I complex, was a prognostic factor for patients with TNBC based on the immunohistochemistry of clinical TNBC tissues. Notably, patients with double IR positivity for MYBL1 and NCAPH showed shorter DFS than those with MYBL1 or NCAPH positivity alone. MYBL1 has been characterized as an essential transcriptional regulator in male meiosis and in female mammary gland development. Our findings indicate that MYBL1 plays an essential role in the pathophysiology for advanced breast cancers such as TNBC, and MYBL1 and its downstream genes can be potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for the disease.

Although these DNA repair-deficient tumors are eligible for effective targeted therapies, fully reliable diagnostic strategies based on functional assay have yet to be established, potentially limiting safe and proper application of the molecular targeted drugs. Here we show that transient transfection of artificial DNA substrates enables ultrarapid detection of HR and MMR. This finding led us to develop a diagnostic strategy that can determine the cellular HR/MMR status within one day without the need for control cells or tissues. Notably, the accuracy of this method allowed the discovery of a pathogenic RAD51D mutation, which was missed by existing companion diagnostic tests. Our methods, termed HR eye and MMR eye, are applicable to frozen tumor tissues and roughly predict the response to therapy. Overall, the findings presented here could pave the way for accurately assessing malignant tumors with functional defects in HR or MMR, a step forward in accelerating precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Chromothripsis, a phenomenon of massive genomic rearrangements, introduces extensive mutations in critical genes, affecting cell survival and apoptosis. Among these genes, the BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) gene, which plays a crucial antiapoptotic role in cancer cells, is often subjected to significant alterations. Here, we present a computational pipeline to model and analyze the structural and functional impacts of chromothripsis-induced Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within the BCL2 gene. This pipeline integrates mutation simulation, homology modeling, and protein inter-action analysis to evaluate the stability and apoptotic potential of BCL2 mutations. These results indicate that chromothripsis-induced mutations can destabilize the Bcl-2 protein, thereby disrupting its binding affinity with apoptotic regulators, such as Bax. These findings support the potential of ergodic anticancer therapy to exploit such mutations, facilitating the apoptosis of cancer cells. Our computational model offers a novel in silico approach for understanding mutation-driven alterations in cancer biology, aiding the development of therapeutic strategies targeting apoptotic pathways.">

        <tr id="There has been a substantial investment in elucidating the mechanism of expansion in hopes of identifying therapeutic targets for Huntington disease (HD). Although an expanded CAG allele is the causal mutation for HD, there is evidence that somatic expansion may not be the only disease driver. We report here that double strand breaks (DSBs) drive HD toxicity by an independent mechanism from somatic expansion. The mutant HD protein inhibits non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity, leading to the accumulation of DSBs. DSBs promote transcriptional pathology in mice that cannot expand their CAG tracts somatically. Conversely, Inhibition of DSBs reverses neuronal toxicity in animals that undergo somatic expansion. Although they coexist in neurons, DSBs and somatic expansion are independent therapeutic targets for HD.">

        <tr id="Aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancer, leads to widespread changes in chromosome copy number, altering the abundance of hundreds or thousands of proteins. How-ever, evidence suggests that levels of proteins encoded on affected chromosomes are often buffered toward their abundances observed in diploid cells. Despite its preval-ence, the molecular mechanisms driving this protein dosage compensation remain largely unknown. It is unclear whether all proteins are buffered to a similar degree, what factors determine buffering, and whether dosage compensation varies across different cell lines or tumor types. Moreover, its potential adaptive advantage and therapeutic relevance remain unexplored. Here, we established a novel approach to quantify protein dosage buffering in a gene copy number-dependent manner, show-ing that dosage compensation is widespread but variable in cancer cell lines and in vivo tumor samples. By developing multifactorial machine learning models, we identify mean gene dependency, protein complex participation, haploinsufficiency, and mRNA decay as key predictors of buffering. We also show that dosage com-pensation can affect oncogenic potential and that higher buffering correlates with reduced proteotoxic stress and increased drug resistance. These findings highlight protein dosage compensation as a crucial regulatory mechanism and a potential therapeutic target in aneuploid cancers.">

 Background:
 Pancreatic cancer has apoor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. While
 K-RAS
 mutations are prevalent in this malignancy, a subset of patients harboring wild-type
 K-RAS
 presents distinct clinical behavior. Gene fusions have been discerned in pancreatic cancer and are promising candidates for administering targeted therapies.
 Methods:
 We conducted a retrospective analysis of 926 pancreatic cancer patients of which 165 (18%) carried a wild-type
 K-RAS
 gene, by next generation sequencing (NGS) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Tumors were analyzed with a clinical-grade hybrid capture-based RNA-seq clinical fusionome test, evaluating gene fusions between 1104 genes or to other known or novel partners as well as gene expression transcript analysis. Single nucleotide variants/insertions deletions (SNV/Indels) were tested with a clinical-grade NGS assay targeting > 300 cancer genes.
 Results:
 Gene fusions were detected in 32% of
 K-RAS
 wild-type pancreatic cancers, with 75% involving known oncogenic, clinically actionable genes including
 FGFR
 (two
 FGFR2
 and one
 FGFR1
 fusion), two
 NTRK3
 and one each of
 RAF1, RET, ROS1
 and
 BRAF
 fusions. Deleterious SNVs were frequently found in both fusion-positive and fusion-negative
 K-RAS
 wild-type pancreatic cancers. Transcriptomic expression revealed additional potentially druggable targets, e.g.,
 ROS1
 and
 FGFR3
 overexpression in a tumor harboring an
 NTRK3
 fusion,
 BRAF
 overexpression in the context of an otherwise non-actionable
 ETV6
 fusion, and
 MET
 overexpression in a
 TES::TFEC
 -fusion bearing cancer.
 Conclusions:
 Druggable fusions are frequent in
 K-RAS
 wild-type pancreatic cancers. Moreover, RNA fusion assays as well as transcriptomic expression testing can identify candidate personalized therapies for patients with
 K-RAS
 wild-type pancreatic cancer.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly resistant to chemotherapy. However, PDAC with germline BRCA mutations, which lead to homologous recombination (HR) deficiency (HRD), demonstrated an increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. This increased chemosensitivity was also seen in PDACs with germline or somatic mutations in the DNA double-strand damage response (DDR) genes beyond canonical HR genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2. However, there are no consensus methods to determine HRD status; and neither is there a well-defined list of HR-DDR genes. In addition, how HRD and/or HR-DDR gene mutation status impacts the tumor immune microenvironment including tumor mutation burden (TMB), neoantigen load, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, and effector T cell infiltration is unknown. Thus, in this study, we developed a new method to categorize PDACs into HRD-positive and HRD-negative subgroups by using results from whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, or both into consideration. We classified a cohort of 89 PDACs into HRD-positive (n = 18) and HRD-negative (n = 69) tumors. HR-DDR gene variants were identified more frequently in HRD-positive PDACs than HRD-negative PDACs, with RAD51B, BRCA2 and ATM alterations most frequently identified in HRD-positive PDACs. Notably, TMB and neoantigen load was significantly higher in HRD-positive PDACs compared to HRD-negative tumors. Interestingly, HRD-positive PDACs, PDACs with high tumor mutational burden, and PDAC with high neoantigen load were all associated with lower CD8 + T lymphocyte infiltration and T cell clonal diversity, suggesting a mechanism of resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Therefore, this study suggests that treatments to enhance effector T cell infiltration and T cell clonal diversity may overcome resistance to ICI-based immunotherapy in HRD-positive PDACs.

 Background:
 Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most common malignancy in young adult men, with a globally increasing incidence. While these tumors are highly curable due to their exceptional sensitivity to cisplatin (cDDP), a proportion of patients develops a resistance to this chemotherapy, which results in disease progression and patient death. The cause of cisplatin resistance in TGCT has not been elucidated yet and is supposed to be multifactorial.
 Methods:
 We conducted a CRISPR Knockout (KO) screening in a TGCT cell line (NCCIT) using a lentiviral sgRNAs library (Addgene #101926) targeting 3015 genes involved in cell cycle regulation and cancer development. The screening population was cultured with or without cDDP (1.25 uM) for 7 days. Samples of treated and control cells were harvested before and after cDDP exposure, the sgRNA cassettes were sequenced by massive parallel sequencing, and the differences in sgRNA abundance were determined using the MAGeCK/MAGeCK-Flute pipeline.
 Results:
 The CRISPR-KO screening data analysis identified 59 gene KOs that were significantly positively selected and 7 gene KOs that were significantly negatively selected after cDDP exposure. Among the top positive hits were genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis (
 BMF, CDIP1
 and
 BAX
 ), epigenetic modifiers (
 HDAC8, SSX2
 ), G-protein regulators (
 ADCY8, GNG10
 ), and others (e.g.
 MAGEA2, ACADM, LAMP1
 ) — inactivation of these genes potentially contributes to the development of cDDP resistance. Among the top negative hits were genes implicated in DNA damage repair (
 FANCB
 ,
 ERCC5
 ), sphingolipid metabolism (
 KDSR
 ), and cytokinesis (
 SPECC1L
 ) — inactivation of these genes may increase sensitivity to cDDP.
 Conclusions:
 The results highlight several potential mechanisms of cDPP resistance in TGCT. Some of these genes and pathways are well known and have been previously described in association with platinum resistance in malignant tumors, while others — such as the G-protein regulators, sphingolipid synthesis, and
 SPECC1L
 — are novel in this context and may reflect the unique biology of TGCT progression. SPECC1L is involved in spindle organization and microtubule stabilization; its paralog SPECC1 is highly expressed in testis. Polyenoic sphingolipids are essential for the completion of meiosis in male germ cells and spermatozoa production.

 ADCY8 controls the production of cAMP, which is a key signaling molecule in spermatogenesis. They have also been described in association with malignant proliferation and progression. The identified hits will be validated in subsequent experiments.

 Background: Large-scale genomic profiling has cataloged the prevalence of single base substitution (SBS) mutational signatures associated with the activity of Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) cytidine deaminases in breast cancer (BC). These mutational signatures are enriched in metastatic BC (mBC) compared to early tumors indicating an association with poor prognosis and a potential function in therapy resistance and disease progression. We sought out to investigate whether APOBEC3 mutational signatures can serve as biomarkers for poor treatment outcomes and if APOBEC3 mutagenesis-driven genomic instability can induce therapy resistance in mBC. Methods: We analyzed SBS mutational signatures in 3,880 BC samples with paired tumor-normal sequencing by the MSK-IMPACT assay using the SigMA algorithm. We utilized the detailed clinical annotation to assess the clinical characteristics of APOBEC3-dominant tumors including survival analyses on endocrine and targeted therapies. We generated cellular models of BC to investigate the molecular drivers of APOBEC3 mutagenesis and its function in promoting therapeutic resistance. We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of BC models and paired primary/metastatic patient samples to identify broader genomic alterations mediated by APOBEC3 activity. Results: Building on published results, we found that APOBEC3 mutational signatures were highly prevalent in all subtypes of BC and enriched in metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) compared to unmatched primary tumors (p < 0.0001 for HR+/HER2-, p < 0.01 for HR+/HER2+ and TNBC). APOBEC3 mutational signatures were independently associated with shorter progression-free survival on antiestrogen plus CDK4/6 inhibitor combination therapy in patients with HR+ mBC (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 - 1.8, p < 0.001). Expression of APOBEC3A (A3A) and APOBEC3B (A3B) enzymes generated APOBEC3-associated alterations including single nucleotide variants, copy number alterations (CNAs), and clustered mutations in a deamination-dependent manner, and promoted resistance acquisition of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BC cells to agents including an ER degrader and CDK4/6 inhibitors. In HER2+ cells, endogenous A3A-driven APOBEC3 activity was also necessary for faster resistance development against anti-HER2 therapies. WGS analyses of resistant models identified CNA events such as loss of heterozygosity in chromosome 13 exclusively in APOBEC3-positive cells. Upon exposure to the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib, these cells acquired APOBEC3-context truncating mutations in RB1 tumor suppressor gene, a well-characterized mechanism of resistance. Detailed analyses of WGS of five paired patient samples also highlighted acquired resistance-linked alterations such as PIK3CA E54XK mutations in APOBEC3-dominant tumors, which were corroborated in paired pre/post-treatment samples in our clinical cohort. The acquisition of APOBEC3-context alterations in APOBEC3-dominant samples highlights the causality of APOBEC3 mutagenesis in driving resistance-promoting changes. Lastly, comparison of mutational signatures in the paired cohort demonstrated pre-existence of APOBEC3 signatures in 75% of pre-treatment samples that became APOBEC3-dominant post-treatment illustrating that APOBEC3 mutagenesis can be active during early stages of BC. Conclusions: Our work reveals that APOBEC3 mutational signatures predict poor treatment outcomes of HR+ mBC. We demonstrate that APOBEC3 mutagenesis, primarily through the enzymatic activity of A3A and A3B, drives resistance to endocrine and targeted therapies by causing APOBEC3-context resistance-associated changes. We further show that the presence of APOBEC3 mutagenesis can be detected before therapy exposure and may therefore represent a valuable biomarker and therapeutic target.

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BC) is a highly prevalent malignancy in women and is often resistant to available therapies, calling for urgent investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis and progression. BC is thought to result from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Among key factors, chronic stress has been associated with worse cancer outcomes and can profoundly impact the epigenome. However, both stress and BC phenotypes are complex and heterogeneous, making studies that examine their molecular links challenging. Despite their heterogeneity, stressors trigger a neuroendocrine response that in humans culminates in the release of cortisol, a highly lipophilic hormone that traverses essentially every cell and induces widespread genomic effects. Modeling such effects at the epigenetic level, here we examine whether cellular DNA methylation (DNAm) markers of chronic stress – derived from human fibroblasts undergoing prolonged exposure to physiological stress cortisol levels – distinguish BC phenotypes in two independent human cohorts. Our results show that methylomic signatures of stress are consistently higher in tumor samples as compared to normal samples and in more advanced tumor stages and grades. Follow-up analyses further identify specific DNAm sites driving these associations, which are significantly enriched for cell adhesion pathways in both cohorts. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms linking stress with BC and a proof-of-concept for utilizing cell model-derived disease biomarkers in environmental epigenetics.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its pronounced cellular heterogeneity, therapy resistance, and metastatic propensity, traits driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs). Once thought to be a rare, static subpopulation, CSCs are now recognized as a dynamic, plastic cell state influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In this review, we explore the “inner” (genetic, cellular, and metabolic) and “outer” (microenvironmental and macroenvironmental) determinants that govern CSC identity, emergence, and evolution in PDAC. We focus on how acinar and ductal cell plasticity, in combination with oncogenic mutations (e.g., KRAS, TP53), contribute to tumor initiation and CSC generation, how genomic instability further fuels CSC heterogeneity and adaptability, and we highlight how micro and macro TME properties, metabolism and external factors regulate CSC behavior afterwards. Altogether, CSCs exist at the nexus of genetic chaos and environmental cues. Understanding this complex interplay is key to developing therapies that not only eradicate CSCs but also prevent their reemergence. While still far from clinical application, disrupting CSC-supportive networks should be a research and clinical focus for improving outcomes for PDAC patients.">

 Background: Combinations of endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) used in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) result in heterogenous clinical benefit with subsets of patients having disease control ranging anywhere from a few months to more than 5 years. Understanding the mechanisms that account for these differences can enable new pharmacologic approaches to convert more of these cancers into the long-term control subset. Methods: To elucidate the causal factors that underlie the observed clinical variability, we have utilized multi-omic analyses of patient samples as well as experimental modeling using a diverse cohort of ER+ breast cancers. For clinicogenomic analyses, we analyzed 467 patients with ER+/ HER2- MBC treated with first-line CDK4/6i at our institution (MSK) with detailed clinical follow annotation and follow up. For genomic/transcriptomic studies, we analyzed single cell RNA sequencing data, whole genome sequencing data, and Ki67 score from the neoadjuvant CDK4/6i containing arms in the FELINE trial (NCT02712723). Patient derived xenografts, patient derived organoids, isogenic cell lines were used to define the underlying mechanisms. Live cell imaging assays were performed by FUCCI cell cycle sensor to assess cell cycle transitions. Results: Of 467 patients from MSK cohort, 129 (27.6%) had pre-CDK4/6i loss-of-function variants in TP53, corresponding to short PFS (median PFS= 8.7 months, 95% CI: 6.6–10.3; HR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.68 to 2.68; p = 2.64e-10). This finding was validated in two large independent clinical cohorts outside MSK. In patient derived and isogenic cell lines, p53 loss had no impact on initial drug response but promoted long-term cell outgrowth and prevented emergence of senescence phenotypes. Following cells in detailed time courses revealed the propensity of p53 mutant but not wild type cells to reenter the cell cycle after initial arrest by CDK4/6 inhibition. Gene expression analysis of RNA seq data revealed a significant positive association between TP53 mutation status and DREAM complex genes, assessed by GSEA (NES= 1.51, p = 1e-4) In models, deletion of DREAM complex component, p130-Rbl2 was found to fully recapitulate the effects of p53 loss: promoting long-term outgrowth from CDK4/6i, blocking therapy induced senescence, and promoting cell cycle re-entry. To validate these results, we analyzed the multi-omic and histologic characteristics of serial samples from the FELINE trial. Compared with WT cases, baseline TP53 LOF had a higher amount of proliferating cells at the end of treatment, measured by Ki67 > 10% (4.5% of WT cases vs. 60% of mutant cases, respectively, OR = 26.8, p = 0.014), the per cell proliferation score, measured by ssGSEA (log2FC: 0.2 vs. 2.8, respectively) as well as a higher pseudobulk expression of DREAM complex related genes (GSEA: NES = 2.0, q = 3.7e-4). Finally, to identify strategies that might facilitate stable cell cycle control of p53KO tumors, we investigated which targets of p53 regulate DREAM and identified p21. Given role of p21 in regulating both CDK4/6 and CDK2 we investigated whether CDK2 inhibitors would provide additional benefit to CDK4/6i. Addition of CDK2i was able to fully restore efficacy in p53KO lines as well as a patient derived model with TP53 mutation enabling irreversible cell cycle arrest and long-term growth suppression. Conclusion: Wild type p53 facilitates DREAM complex assembly in response to CDK4/6i in ER+ breast cancer, underlying long-term disease control. p53 loss enables cells to reenter the cell cycle and facilitates the development of CDK4/6i resistance. Combined inhibition of CDK2 with CDK4/6 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming loss of p53 and enabling long-term antitumor efficacy.

        <tr id="Canine lymphoma, a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous disease, represents a significant proportion of canine cancers. We present a large-scale study of 238 dogs with lymphoma to better understand the genetic landscape of canine lymphoma, as well as the relationship to clinical outcomes. Using a targeted next-generation sequencing panel comprising 308 genes, we screened somatic and germline mutations in matched tumor and normal samples. Our findings revealed key associations between genetic alterations and lymphoma subtypes, with certain somatic variants linked to significant differences in response to common chemotherapy regimens. Recurrent mutations in genes such as KMT2C, KMT2D, NOTCH2, TRAF3, CCND1, ARID1A, CREBBP, and TP53 were observed, with TRAF3 mutations standing out for their significant association with prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival in B-cell lymphomas. In contrast, mutations in PIK3CD and CREBBP were associated with inferior outcomes in T-cell lymphomas, highlighting the immunophenotype-specific impact of genetic alterations on treatment responses. These findings support the integration of comprehensive genomic profiling in planning treatment strategies and optimizing clinical outcomes in canine lymphomas.">

 Background:
 Histone lactylation, a newly identified epigenetic modification, has been extensively implicated in the initiation and progression of tumors. However, the precise role of histone lactylation in modulating tumor cell responses to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity remains insufficiently explored.
 Methods:
 To elucidate the adaptive changes tumor cells undergo in response to T cell-induced cytotoxicity within the tumor microenvironment (TME), we performed a comprehensive, genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen. This approach facilitated the identification of genetic alterations in lung cancer cells co-cultured with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that promote their evasion of T cell-mediated destruction. Complementary RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells modulate their response to T cell-mediated killing, particularly following the deletion of the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1).
 Results:
 MCT1 deletion significantly heightened the cancer-cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing. Furthermore, the loss of MCT1 led to mitochondrial dysfunction within the tumor cells. Mechanistically, MCT1 knockout resulted in a reduction of histone H3K18 lactylation and downregulation of ferridoxin reductase (FDXR), which disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis and precipitated mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, the combination of MCT1 inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy substantially enhanced ICB efficacy, prolonged survival in both lung cancer and malignant pleural effusion (MPE) murine models, and alleviated the immunosuppressive milieu within the TME.
 Conclusions:
 Our findings reveal a novel role for lactate metabolism in modulating mitochondrial dysfunction and anti-tumor immunity, with lactylation-mediated regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis serving as a critical mechanism. These results provide new insights into the epigenetic regulation of tumorigenesis and highlight potential immune-metabolic strategies for targeted lactate metabolism therapies in the treatment of lung cancer and MPE.

        <tr id="BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BRAF/MEKi) have radically changed the treatment landscape of advanced BRAF mutation-positive tumours. However, limited efficacy and emergence of drug resistance are major barriers for successful treatments. Here, by using relevant preclinical models, we find that Connexin43 (Cx43), a protein that plays a role in cell-to-cell communication, enhances the effectiveness of BRAF/MEKi by recruiting DNA repair complexes to lamin-associated domains and promoting persistent DNA damage and cellular senescence. The nuclear compartmentalization promoted by Cx43 contributes to genome instability and synthetic lethality caused by excessive DNA damage, which could provide a therapeutic approach for these tumours to overcome drug resistance. Based on these findings, we designed a drug combination using small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) to deliver the full-Cx43 in combination with the BRAF/MEKi. This study reveals Cx43 as a regulator of DNA repair and BRAF/MEKi response, highlighting the therapeutic potential that this approach could eventually have in the clinic to overcome the limitations of current therapies and improve treatment outcomes for patients with advanced BRAF mutant tumours.">

        <tr id="How the host immune system loses its surveillance function during the evolution from normal cell to malignancy is still largely unknown. Here, we investigate the dynamics changes of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor microenvironment by profiling 132,115 single-cell transcriptomes derived from 51 tissues, including healthy pancreatic tissue, non-metastatic PDAC primary tumors, metastatic primary tumors, and patient-matched liver metastases. The cellular proportion, bio-functional, and interaction between each cell type are carefully characterized. Aberrant copy number variations (CNVs) indicating malignant intensity are identified at chromosomes 7 and 20 of epithelial cells during tumor development. A bio-functional transition of predominant genes from physiology to pancreatic oncogenesis and metastasis is observed. Combinatorial analysis of epithelial cells and immunocytes indicates a gradient loss of immune surveillance during the malignant transformation. By dissecting cellular interaction, we unravel an incremental tumor cell-triggered apoptosis of DCs through molecular pair ANXA1-FPR1/3. Consequently, the activation and infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are dampened progressively. Remarkably, we unveil a novel subtype of stress-response NK cells (strNK), which are characterized by robust proliferation, diminished cytolytic capabilities, and negative immune regulation. Notably, the presence of strNK cells is associated with poor prognosis of PDAC patients, implying a potential pro-tumor function. Taken together, our results not only shed light on the intricate mechanisms underlying step-wise evasion of immune surveillance during PDAC tumor development, but also provide a potential strategy for holding back malignant transition by reinforcing DCs’ function.">

        <tr id="Maintaining genome integrity is crucial for the proper functioning and development of organisms. One intriguing aspect of genome integrity is the formation and function of neocentromeres at non-centromeric sites. CENP-A, a centromere-specific protein, is essential for centromere identification and function. However, in many cancers, CENP-A is often found to be ectopically misplaced when overexpressed. Moreover, CENP-A deposition at the centromere depends on the transcription of centromeric non-coding RNAs. Consequently, ectopic CENP-A is found at transcriptionally active and frequent breakpoint regions. To further explore ectopic CENP-A localization, we previously engineered a stable ectopic CENP-A site on a naïve chromosome by overexpressing a non-centromeric oncogenic lncRNA, PCAT2, which was capable of recruiting CENP-A to its transcription site. In this work, we tracked cells carrying this stable transgene to understand the longevity of the induced ectopic CENP-A site at the chromosome that harbors it. Our findings revealed that the induced epigenetic memory was eventually lost due to the suppression of the transgene through competing epigenetic silencing mechanisms. This epigenetic restoration naturally reversed the ectopic CENP-A level to its previous levels at the engineered site. These data suggest that cells may have evolved failsafe mechanisms to prevent neocentromere formation at ectopic sites by suppressing transcription, unless otherwise favored by selection involving multiple components.">

Schlafen family member 11 (SLFN11) gene is associated with the sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (DDAs). The knockout of SLFN11 is associated with acquired chemoresistance in both cell lines and preclinical models. Here, we aimed to elucidate the metabolic underpinnings of SLFN11-loss associated chemoresistance in patient derived cell lines of EWS. Our integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed downregulation of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GPD2) gene, which was accompanied by the upregulation of glycerophospholipid (GPL) biosynthesis pathway. Further, therapeutic targeting of lipid synthesis with the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 (GPAT1) inhibitor (FSG67) enhanced the efficacy of the DDA (SN-38) in SLFN11−/− cells. These findings indicate that SLFN11 loss-mediated chemoresistance can be targeted by blocking GPL biosynthesis in addition to DDA administration.">

 In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), genetic mutations distort hematopoietic differentiation, resulting in the accumulation of leukemic blasts. However, it remains unclear how these mutations intersect with the cellular origins of each patient's disease, and whether distinct sets of mutations converge upon similar differentiation patterns. Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled high-resolution mapping of the relationship between leukemia and normal hematopoietic cell states. Yet, this application has been hampered by imprecise reference maps of normal hematopoiesis, or by small patient cohort sizes which do not adequately capture the extent of inter-patient heterogeneity in AML. To resolve this, we constructed a reference atlas of human bone marrow hematopoiesis from 263,519 single-cell transcriptomes enriched for rare hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The resulting reference spans 55 cellular states and has been benchmarked against independent datasets of purified HSPCs. Using this comprehensive reference atlas, we confidently mapped over 1.2 million single-cell transcriptomes from 318 patient samples spanning AML, mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), and acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) diagnoses. Single-cell composition analysis revealed twelve patient subgroups, each reflecting distinct patterns of aberrant differentiation in AML. Strikingly, some AML samples exhibited virtually no overlap in cell state involvement with one another, likely reflecting their disparate cellular origins. One subgroup was enriched for early lymphoid progenitors and featured co-clustering of AML and MPAL samples. Notably, this early lymphoid subgroup included an AML sample which eventually relapsed with lymphoid disease. To understand the genetic determinants of aberrant differentiation in AML, we quantified leukemia cell state abundance in >1,200 patient samples and evaluated genotype-to-phenotype associations to link >40 genetic driver alterations with their specific impacts on AML differentiation. This identified genetic drivers for unconventional lineage phenotypes in AML, including erythroid lineage priming associated with the co-occurrence of complex cytogenetics with TP53 mutations as well as lymphoid lineage priming associated with bi-allelic RUNX1 mutations. We also identified non-genetic determinants of AML differentiation. For example, we identified two subgroups of KMT2A-rearranged AML with distinct cellular origins reflecting either HSPCs or committed myeloid precursors. Last, we show that distinct leukemia cell hierarchies can co-exist within individual patients, providing insights into AML evolution. Together, single-cell reference mapping of malignant cell states provides a framework for understanding the impact of genetic alterations on hematopoietic differentiation across hundreds of individual AML patients.

        <tr id="The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been harnessed and repurposed into a powerful genome editing tool. By leveraging this technology, researchers can precisely cut, paste, and even rewrite DNA sequences within living cells. Nevertheless, the application of CRISPR screen technology goes far beyond mere experimentation. It serves as a pivotal tool in the fight against genetic diseases, systematically dissecting complex genetic landscapes, empowering researchers to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying biological phenomena, and enabling scientists to identify and target the root causes of illnesses such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia. Among all, cancer poses a formidable challenge for medicine, spurring eradication efforts. Radiotherapy, as a traditional treatment, yields results but has limitations. It eradicates cancer cells but also damages healthy tissues, causing adverse effects that reduce quality of life. Additionally, not all cancer cells respond to radiotherapy, and some may develop resistance, worsening the condition. To address this, a comprehensive whole-genome CRISPR screen technology is introduced, as it enables the efficient identification of radiosensitive and radioresistant genes, thereby advancing the field of cancer research and treatment. A genome-wide CRISPR screen was conducted in lung adenocarcinoma cells exposed to irradiation following the described protocol, through which both radioresistance- and radiosensitivity-associated genes were identified.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2, which drove the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic, continues to engender inquiries into the role of host genetic factors in disease susceptibility. Despite the identification of over 1,000 genes potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, the mechanisms connecting genetic variants to phenotype remain elusive. To shed light on these mechanisms, we undertook an integrated analysis, merging data from whole-genome association analyses of COVID-19 with methylome and transcriptomic. Methods: Study includes African American adults from the GENE-FORECAST study, encompassing 371 individuals with whole genome sequencing (WGS), 203 with DNA methylation, and 321 with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of blood. 53.3% of participants reported COVID-19. Significant loci associated with COVID-19 were examined within the framework of methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) which located near the gene-of-original (cis-mQTL) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) which located near the gene-of-origin (cis-eQTL), enabling analysis to assess mediators between genetic variants and COVID-19 status. Results: Our analysis identified four intronic variants and confirmed a missense variant, rs1052067, in PMF1 associated with COVID-19. Causal mediation analysis revealed that the combination of genetic variants within PMF1, epigenomics, and transcriptomics mapped four pathways influencing COVID-19 status. These pathways include: rs9659072 -> DNAm at chr1:156285845 (annotated to TMEM79) -> ENSG00000198715:13 (annotated to GLMP); rs12083543 -> DNAm at chr1:155951748 (ARHGEF2) -> ENSG00000198715:13 (GLMP); rs1052067 -> DNAm at chr1:155951748 (ARHGEF2)-> ENSG00000198715:13 (GLMP); rs1543294 -> ENSG00000198715:13 (GLMP) -> DNAm at chr1:156077518 (MEX3A). Conclusions: Through integrated multi-omics analyses, we identified genetic variants whose effects on COVID-19 susceptibility are mediated by changes in DNA methylation and mRNA expression. These findings offer insights into potential mechanistic pathways that merit further exploration.">

 Background:
 Cells possess a complex DNA damage response (DDR) system to prevent detrimental mutations from accumulating. The genes encoding various DDR components are frequently mutated in cancer cells and provide potential sites for therapeutic intervention. DNA damaging agents, with one exception, are repaired by the global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) pathway. Our novel class of drugs, Illudins, are the exception as Illudin-induced DNA damage is not recognized by GG-NER and can only be repaired by the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway. Studies utilizing isogeneic cell lines completely deficient in specific TC-NER proteins (e.g. homozygous ERCC6 knockout) indicate these cells are extremely sensitive to Illudins (up to 30-fold). In contrast, cells deficient in GG-NER activity are not sensitive to our drugs. Moreover, non-replicating or normal cells are minimally affected by Illudins, as evidenced by the lack of systemic toxicity in humans treated with one of our drugs. In TC-NER deficient cancer cells, however, our drug ITX-0121 blocks the TC-NER polymerase complex, which disengages from DNA, and initiates the irreversible process of apoptosis or cellular suicide. Many cancers exhibit deficiencies in DDR mechanisms and cannot properly repair DNA damage.
 Methods:
 Analysis of the GENIE Database indicates that the overall incidence of TC-NER deficient cancers in solid tumors is ~10%, and includes all major histological classifications (breast, ovarian, endometrial, prostate, renal, bladder, bone, colorectal, liver, lung, skin, pancreatic, thyroid, etc.) or ~175,000 new patients annually. These cancers, however, possess monoallelic mutations, as opposed to biallelic, and thus have some residual TC-NER functionality. To determine the relative sensitivity of cancers with monoallelic alterations in TC-NER genes, we generated colorectal HCT-116 cells with a monoallelic deletion in a single TC-NER gene. For example, we are generating daughter cell lines with small monoallelic deletions in ERCC2, ERCC3, ERCC4, ERCC6, and ELOF1 genes.
 Results:
 We are comparing sensitivity of these daughter lines to our lead drug ITX-0121, as well as to other DNA damaging agents such as cisplatin. Preliminary results indicate a monoallelic alteration in a TC-NER gene can confer > 6-fold sensitivity to ITX-0121, which is clinically relevant based on PK results. Based on these PK results, we believe the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ITX-0121 in patients to be > 1.2 mg/kg; yet only 0.4 mg/kg will be sufficient for clinical efficacy against cancers that are phenotypically TC-NER deficient.
 Conclusions:
 Thus, despite the administration of a cytotoxic agent, TC-NER deficient cancer patients can be treated at a non-toxic dose; if toxicity occurs, it should be limited to transient thrombocytopenia, as indicated by prior studies.

        <tr id="Melanomas are genetically heterogeneous, displaying mitogen-activated protein kinase mutations and homozygous loss of tumor suppressor genes. Mouse models combining such mutations produce fast-growing tumors. In contrast, rare, slow-growing tumors arise in mice combining Braf activation with heterozygous loss of Pten. Here we show that similar tumors can arise in albino mice bearing only a Braf mutation. Incidence kinetics suggest a stochastic event underlies tumorigenesis in tumors that arise with only a Braf mutation, yet de novo mutations or structural variants that could explain the incidence of most tumors could not be found. Single-cell transcriptomics of tumors identify a cell type resembling “neural crest-like” cells in human and mouse melanomas. These exist in normal mouse skin, expand upon Braf activation, and persist through serial transplantation; analyses of gene expression suggest they serve as precursors of malignant cells. This state may serve as an intermediate on a slow path to malignancy that may provide a diagnostically and therapeutically important source of cellular heterogeneity.">

        <tr id="Background Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (ACT) is a significant concern for cancer survivors, while genetic basis of ACT remains unclear. This study employs a murine genetic reference population (GRP) of BXD recombinant inbred strains, derived from DBA/2J (D2) and C57BL/6J (B6) crosses, to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to doxorubicin (DOX)-induced phenotypes through systems genetics approaches. Methods To model variability in ACT, 58 BXD strains and parental B6 and D2 mice (n ≥ 4 mice/sex/strain, 3–4-month-old) underwent an intraperitoneal injection of DOX (20 mg/kg). Survival and body weight (BW) were monitored for 10 days. Echocardiography was performed before treatment and on Day 5 post-treatment, followed by genetic mapping and Mendelian randomization analyses for identifying QTLs and candidate genes associated with DOX-induced traits and severity. Results Parental B6 strain had 60% survival, whereas 24% of D2 mice survived on Day 10. Among BXD strains, median survival varied, with BXD77 showing the lowest at Day 4. Echocardiography revealed cardiac dysfunction and a small-heart phenotype resembling ACT patients. Significant QTLs on Chromosome 10 (86–94 Mb), Chromosome 19 (52.5–54.2 Mb) and on Chromosome 14 (103–120 Mb) were associated with the survival, mean BW loss, and left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF%), respectively. MR analysis identified significant causal associations between the genes implicated in BW loss (ADD3, HSPA12 A, SLC18 A2, PDZD8, DUSP5, CASP7) as well as EF% and LV volumes (GPC6, UGGT2, SLAIN1, POU4 F1, MBNL2) in BXD mice post-DOX and heart failure outcomes in humans. Most of the top candidates showed cardiomyocyte specific expression based on scRNA-seq data. Conclusions Survival, BW loss, and echocardiography parameters considerably varied among DOX-treated BXDs, suggesting significant influence of genetic background on expression of those traits. Several candidate genes that may modulate ACT susceptibility and heart failure were identified, providing a foundation for genetic-based risk stratification and therapeutics in cardio-oncology.

        <tr id="Canine malignant insulinoma is a rare, highly metastatic and life-threatening neuroendocrine tumour of pancreatic beta cells. To map the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of canine insulinoma for the first time, transcriptomic profiles of 5,532 cells were captured from two spontaneous insulinomas (Patient 1 and 2) and one associated metastasis (Patient 2) in two Boxer dogs. Distinct cancer, endocrine, and immune cell populations were identified. Notably, all three tumour samples contained two transcriptionally distinct insulin-expressing tumour cell populations (INS+ and INS+FOSlow), characterised here for the first time. These two cancer cell populations significantly differed by ~ 8,000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), particularly tumour suppressor genes (e.g. TP53, EGR1) and cancer-related pathways (e.g., MAPK, p53). In contrast, COX7A2L was one of a few genes ubiquitously expressed and significantly upregulated (> 20-fold) in both insulin-expressing tumour populations compared to other captured populations. Both populations were also characterised by expression of chromogranin/secretogranin neuroendocrine tumour marker genes (e.g. CHGA, SCGN). There were far fewer gene expression differences observed between insulin-expressing tumour cells from the two patients (~ 600 DEGs) than between the two cancer cell populations within each patient. These DEGs included CLTRN, TMSB4X, CSRP2, LGALS2, and C15orf48. Unexpectedly for a tumour of endocrine origin, the metastasis in Patient 2 exhibited > 20–70 fold upregulation of exocrine pancreatic genes including CLPS, PRSS2, PRSS and CTRC. Immune cell analyses identified distinct infiltrating immune populations, including memory T cells and macrophages and revealed likely tumour-immune interactions, including the CD40-CD40L interaction. This study provides the first single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of naturally occurring insulinoma in any species, revealing tumour cell heterogeneity, novel immune microenvironment features, and potential therapeutic targets. Despite its small scale, the findings highlight the utility of scRNA-seq in veterinary oncology and its translational potential for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours across species.

However, effective clinical treatments for patients with this mutation are limited, highlighting a demand for new therapeutic strategies. Here, we establish Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase (WRN) as a critical vulnerability target in ARID1A-mutated cancers. Upon genetic and pharmacological inhibition of WRN, ARID1A-mutated cells had defective Chk1-mediated DNA damage signaling, resulting in compensatory Chk2 activation, leading to G1-phase arrest and apoptosis, whereas ARID1A-proficient cells underwent Chk1-dependent G2/M arrest. Additional p21 inhibition, combined with WRN suppression, drove G1-arrested cells to re-enter the cell cycle, triggering mitotic catastrophe. The anti-tumor efficacy of WRN inhibition was validated using in vivo cell lines and patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Our findings define WRN as a selective therapeutic target in ARID1A-mutated cancers and suggest a combinatorial strategy of WRN and p21 inhibition as a therapeutic approach.">

        <tr id="Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern, impacting over half a million women annually. The primary cause is a persistent infection with hr-HPV, which disrupts various cellular processes crucial for normal function. This disruption leads to genetic instability, including changes in the expression of microRNAs and their corresponding host genes, with far-reaching consequences for cellular regulation. Researchers have widely utilized high-throughput technologies to analyze gene expression in cervical cancer, aiming to identify distinct molecular signatures of microRNAs and genes through genomic analysis. However, discrepancies among studies have been noted, possibly due to variations in sample collection, technological platforms, and data processing methods such as normalization and filtering. Therefore, it is essential to synthesize findings from diverse studies to comprehensively understand the molecular mechanisms of regulatory genetic networks involved in the initiation and progression of cervical cancer. This review examined the evidence detailing the role of microRNA signatures and their target genes in cervical carcinogenesis and disease advancement. The accumulated data suggest the presence of widespread regulatory genetic networks active in both precancerous and cancerous cervical cells, potentially acting as key drivers of this malignancy. Identifying these molecular genomic signatures could open new avenues for developing therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer, particularly in the realm of precision medicine.">

This is partly caused by the overuse of Chemotherapeutic drugs against Cancer, leading to its potency. Cancer starts with an accumulation of genetic mutations in the genome, and the ignorance to cell checks by CD8 and NK cells. The Cancer cell utilizes its hallmark capabilities and uses one of its cells to metastasizes in other areas of the body either through the perineural, circulatory, or lymphatic system. p53 is a tumor suppressor gene which repairs the mutations of the cell by conducting cell cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis. However, cancer cells can increase the expression of SB100 which can inhibit p53. One solution is to combine PRIMA-1 and CDDP which restores p53 and it’s wild type functions to induce apoptosis.

 Recent advancements in genomic technologies have become critical tools for deciphering the genetic complexities of cancer tissues, enabling precision medicine strategies aimed at improving patient clinical outcomes. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of clinically annotated whole genome and whole transcriptome sequences from 1,364 breast cancer cases. Our investigation provides the most detailed genomic landscapes of breast cancer to date, which allowed us to comprehensively correlate genomic changes with clinical characteristics. Our findings include, but not limited to, (1) whole-genome-based homologous recombination deficiency profiles effectively predict responses to adjuvant chemotherapy and first-line CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, (2) focal ERBB2 amplifications, often arising via extrachromosomal DNA mechanisms, are strongly associated with a positive response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Additionally, our study identified (3) recurrent copy number amplifications linked to patient survival, and (4) whole-genome-based intratumoral heterogeneity profiles that can predict patient survival as well as response to anti-HER2 therapies. Our work underscores the power of highly annotated whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of a population-scale cancer cohorts for uncovering clinically relevant genomic mutations and novel molecular targets, thereby advancing precision oncology strategies for breast cancer.

        <tr id="Epitranscriptomics has emerged as a rapidly evolving field that focused on studying post-transcriptional RNA modifications and their role in spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) represent the most extensively studied modifications on mRNAs. These reversible modifications, mediated by ‘writer,’ ‘eraser,’ and ‘reader’ proteins, dynamically fine-tune mRNA stability, splicing, and translation. Growing evidence links their dysregulation to pathological states, including cancer progression and metastasis, where their aberrant deposition on oncogenes or tumor suppressors alters cellular signaling and therapeutic responses. In the current study, we present a detailed analysis of the m5C epitranscriptomic landscape across distinct breast cancer molecular subtypes. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we confirm NSUN2 as a key m5C writer in human mRNAs. NSUN2 loss was validated by targeted sequencing and Western blotting. Furthermore, we demonstrate the regulatory effects of NSUN2 on its canonical mRNA targets, revealing its critical role in maintaining proper gene expression networks. Our findings strongly suggest that additional m5C writers contribute to m5C methylation machinery. Additionally, we assessed the functional impact of NSUN2 depletion on mRNAs harboring m5C sites using mRNA stability assays. Furthermore, our analysis revealed distinct m5C methylation patterns among breast cancer subtypes, highlighting unique m5C signatures associated with the disease. Notably, we identified specific hypomethylated and hypermethylated m5C sites in each breast cancer cell line, representing a universal m5C methylation signature for breast cancer. Our study constitutes the first comprehensive m5C epitranscriptomic atlas in human breast cancer and paves the way for future research aimed at developing targeted therapeutic interventions that leverage the m5C methylation landscape.

        <tr id="Background Cervical cancer (CC) remains a significant global health challenge despite advancements in screening, HPV vaccination, and therapeutic strategies. Tumor heterogeneity, driven by epigenetic modifications, affects immune evasion, metastasis, and treatment response. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in CC progression and therapy resistance. Single-cell sequencing offers new insights but remains underutilized in CC research. This study integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and deconvolution analysis to identify key genes and immunotherapy targets. By constructing a prognostic model and exploring the immune microenvironment, we aim to provide novel insights into CC pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies. Methods We utilized scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, deconvolution analysis, and pseudotime trajectory mapping to delineate fibroblast subtypes within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of CC. Functional annotations, differential gene expression profiling, cell–cell communication pathways, and transcription factor networks were systematically analyzed. A prognostic model based on bulk RNA-seq data was constructed and validated through survival analysis, with correlations to immune microenvironment characteristics. Functional experiments investigated the role of SDC1, a critical mediator of fibroblast-tumor crosstalk. Additionally, Fibroblast–tumor cell co-culture systems and functional assays were employed to investigate the paracrine role of SDC1. The CAF MYH11⁺ subpopulation was isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Multiplex immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on both cultured cells and human cervical cancer tissue samples to characterize the spatial distribution and dynamic remodeling of MYH11 during stromal reorganization. Results Six distinct fibroblast subtypes were identified, including the C0 MYH11 + fibroblasts, which exhibited unique roles in stemness maintenance, metabolic activity, and immune regulation. Spatial and functional analyses revealed that the C0 subtype is central to tumor-fibroblast interactions, particularly through the MDK-SDC1 signaling axis. The prognostic model incorporating fibroblast-specific markers demonstrated robust predictive power for patient survival outcomes. Additionally, in vitro SDC1 knockdown significantly inhibited CC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Fibroblasts show spatially regulated heterogeneity, with activation markers enriched in the tumor zone and MYH11 highest in normal zones, indicating dynamic stromal remodeling. C0 MYH11 + CAF Promotes Tumor Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Inhibits Apoptosis via Soluble SDC1. Conclusion Our results illustrate, in some ways, the possible immunomodulatory and tumor supporting roles of CAFs in CC TIME and highlight the possibility that the MDK-SDC1 pathway is a promising therapeutic target. This study not only promotes a partially new understanding of temporal heterogeneity in CC, but also provides a possible reference base for the development of new biomarkers and immunotherapy approaches to improve clinical outcomes.

        <tr id="One of the strongest signatures of aging is an accumulation of mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy. Here we investigate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon by calling mtDNA sequence, abundance, and heteroplasmic variation in human blood using whole genome sequences from ∼750,000 individuals. Our analyses reveal a simple, two-step mechanism: first, individual cells randomly accumulate low levels of “cryptic” mtDNA mutations; then, when a cell clone proliferates, the cryptic mtDNA variants are carried as passenger mutations and become detectable in whole blood. Four lines of evidence support this model: (1) the mutational spectrum of age-accumulating mtDNA variants is consistent with a well-established model of mtDNA replication errors, (2) these mutations are found primarily at low levels of heteroplasmy and do not show evidence of positive selection, (3) high mtDNA mutation burden tends to co-occur in samples harboring somatic driver mutations for clonal hematopoiesis (CH), and (4) nuclear GWAS reveals that germline variants predisposing to CH (such as those near TERT, TCL1A, and SMC4) also increase mtDNA mutation burden. We propose that the high copy number and high mutation rate of mtDNA make it a particularly sensitive blood-based marker of CH. Importantly, our work helps to mechanistically unify three prominent signatures of aging: common germline variants in TERT, clonal hematopoiesis, and observed mtDNA mutation accrual.">

 Cancer treatment options including small molecules, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), CAR T-cells, and combination therapies are rapidly expanding to improve cancer patient survival. However, efficacy of targeted therapies is limited by interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneity in breast cancer, and may be further exacerbated by dysregulated tumor microenvironments. For example, studies suggested that changes in tumor and breast tissue microenvironment in obesity (e.g. inflammation, increased growth factors) could lead to worsened prognosis that could be related to therapy resistance. Systematic characterization of the cellular effects of emerging drug candidates, particularly across different tumor microenvironments, is challenging, as it needs to be surveyed in diverse cancer contexts beyond just a handful of cancer cell lines. To overcome this challenge, we created PRISM (Profiling Relative Inhibition Simultaneously in Mixtures), an effective drug discovery screening platform with over 900 genetically distinct cancer cell lines of diverse lineages, to rapidly test therapeutics in a high-throughput manner. These cell lines, including 33 different breast cancer cell lines covering diverse cell types and subgroups, carry a specific 24 nucleotide “barcode” tag and have rich baseline genomic and functional characterization. They are first pooled into 20-25 cell pools of different lineages with similar growth rates, then subsequently cultured together with or without drugs. The relative barcode quantity read out by NextGen sequencing determines cell line responses to drugs. This pooled approach significantly reduces the time and the resources required for drug screening. Importantly, utilizing the rich cell line characterization to interpret viability profiles enables the identification of drivers of differential sensitivity and potential biomarkers of compound response. Furthermore, we created a breast cancer cell specific pool to investigate how media conditions mirroring different tumor microenvironments [e.g. media filtration, addition of insulin (0.01 mg/mL) or EGF (0.01 ug/mL)] can impact drug effects on breast cancer cells. In the PRISM 900+ cell panel treated with ADCs conjugated to different payloads that target HER2, there was a clear association between cell line sensitivity and ERBB2 (encoding HER2) gene expression, with the strongest effects on viability observed in a subset of cell lines overexpressing ERBB2. Upon further comparison of biomarker profiles across different ADCs, we established relationships between payload resistance and ABCB1 efflux pumps emerged for a subset of ADC payloads. Using the breast cancer cell specific pool, our data showed that estrogen receptor (ER) degraders fulvestrant and vepdegestrant (ARV-471) had significantly greater effects in reducing viability of ER+ versus ER- breast cancer cell lines. Media filtering reduced the drug effects of fulvestrant but not ARV-471, suggesting that ARV-471 efficacy may be less sensitive to the tumor microenvironment than fulvestrant. Lapatinib (HER2/neu and EGF receptor inhibitor) was more effective in killing HER2+ than HER2- negative breast cancer cells, with cells cultured in EGF-spiked media being more sensitive to lapatinib, whereas media filtration diminished its effects. We did not observe breast cancer subgroup specific killing by alpelisib (PI3K inhibitor) or olaparib (PARP inhibitor), but breast cancer cells became less sensitive to alpelisib when cultured in either insulin- or EGF-spiked media, and less sensitive to olaparib in EGF-spiked media. Overall, our study highlights how the PRISM 900+ cell panel can provide insights into drug specificity, cancer subtype selectivity, and to uncover clinically relevant targets. The breast cancer specific pool can further increase the throughput of understanding how drug responses may be altered in different tumor microenvironments in breast cancer.

Etiology of the phenotypic variability remains elusive. Here, we hypothesized that decreased genomic diversity, manifested by increased homozygosity, may be one etiology. Comprehensive analyses of 376 PHTS patients of European ancestry revealed significant enrichment of homozygous common variants in genes involved in inflammatory processes in the PHTS-NDD group and in genes involved in differentiation and chromatin structure regulation in the PHTS-ASD group. Pathway analysis revealed pathways germane to NDD/ASD, including neuroinflammation and synaptogenesis. Collapsing analysis of the homozygous variants identified suggestive modifier NDD/ASD genes. In contrast, we found enrichment of homozygous ultra-rare variants in genes modulating cell death in the PHTS-cancer group. Finally, homozygosity burden as a predictor of ASD versus cancer outcomes in our validated prediction model for NDD/ASD performed favorably.">

 International efforts focused on discovery of biological targets in inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) have suggested that aberrant inter-cellular relationship instead of genomic aberrations is the key driver of IBC. To identify such IBC-specific aberrations, we generated single nucleus chromatin accessibility and transcriptome atlas of IBCs (9,628 nuclei from three donors) and compared IBC atlas with a similar atlas of the healthy breast (81,735 nuclei from 92 donors). We recently reported single nucleus atlas of breast tissues of healthy women of diverse genetic ancestry (Nature Medicine in press). In that report, we described markers that identify three major epithelial cell subtypes [Basal-myoepithelial (BM), luminal adaptive secretory precursor (LASP), luminal hormone sensing (LHS)], two endothelial cell subtypes, two adipocyte subtypes, fibroblasts, macrophages, and T cells of the healthy breast. We also showed that LHS cells are the likely cells-of-origin of Luminal A, Luminal B and HER2+ breast cancers. Unlike these breast cancer subtypes, IBC does not appear to have a cell-of-origin, as epithelial cells in IBCs shared gene expression pattern across BM, LASP and LHS cells. Similar results were obtained when comparison was restricted to ancestry-specific healthy breast atlas. However, individual gene level expression differences affecting specific signaling pathways were observed in epithelial cells of IBCs. LASP, and LHS cells of IBCs overexpressed GPR137C, a positive regulator of mTORC1 signaling, and HS6ST3, an enzyme required for heparan sulfate synthesis. LASP and LHS cells of IBCs displayed activation of mitotic and matrix metalloproteinase signaling, respectively. Endothelial cells of IBCs, which showed significant gene expression differences compared to endothelial cells of the healthy breast, displayed enhanced integrin cell surface interaction but loss of cell junction organization. Most critically, BM, LASP, LHS, and endothelial cells of IBCs compared to their counterparts in the healthy breast showed downregulation of TEX14, an inter-cellular bridge forming factor in germ cells and a regulator of mitosis. Downregulation of TEX14 expression in these cells was accompanied with changes in the chromatin accessibility patterns of this gene. These results reinforce the notion that defective inter-cellular communication is a hallmark of IBC and TEX14 expression levels may serve as a biomarker of this defect. We suggest that greater attention to vascular biology and vascular-epithelial cell communication has to be given for better understanding of IBC biology and therapeutic targeting.

Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), transcribed from active enhancer regions, are increasingly recognized as key regulators of transcription. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most plentiful internal modification in eukaryotic mRNAs, has garnered significant research interest in recent years. With advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies, it has been established that m6A modifications are also present on eRNAs. An accumulative body of evidence demonstrates that aberrant enhancers, eRNAs, and m6A modifications are intimately connected with carcinoma onset, progression, invasion, metastasis, treatment response, drug resistance, and prognosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms governing m6A modification of eRNAs in cancer remain elusive. Here, we review and synthesize current understanding of the regulatory roles of enhancers, eRNAs, and m6A modifications in cancer. Furthermore, we investigate the possible roles of eRNAs m6A modification in tumorigenesis based on existing literature, offering novel perspectives and directions for future research on epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Cervical and other anogenital malignancies are largely caused by E6 and E7 oncogenes of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), which inhibit important tumor suppressors like p53 and pRb when they are persistently activated. The main goal of traditional treatments is to physically or chemically kill cancer cells, but they frequently only offer temporary relief, have serious side effects, and have a high risk of recurrence. Exploring the efficacy and accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in both inducing death in HPV-infected cancer cells and restoring the activity of tumor suppressors is our main goal. In this study, we propose a novel precision oncology strategy that targets and inhibits the detrimental effects of the E6 and E7 oncogenes using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system. In order to do this, we create unique guide RNAs that target the integrated HPV DNA and reactivate p53 and pRb. Reactivation is meant to halt aberrant cell development and restart the cell’s natural dying pathways. This review discusses the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in targeting HPV oncogenes, with a focus on studies that have demonstrated its promise in cancer treatment. Given the absence of a definitive treatment for papillomavirus infection and its subsequent association with various cancers, future clinical trials and experimental investigations appear essential to establish and evaluate the therapeutic potential of CRISPR-based approaches. This approach provides a less invasive alternative to conventional treatments and opens the door to personalized care that considers the genetic makeup of each patient’s tumor.">

 Background:
 HRD is linked to sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors across various tumor types. However, the presence of HRD, driver events (such as pathogenic mutations in HR genes or other genomic alterations), and its clinical relevance in mCRC remain underexplored.
 Methods:
 We performed the VHIO-300 test, an ISO15189 accredited custom NGS panel profiling over 450 genes (including HR-related genes:
 ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2 or PALB2
 ) on 356 Stage IV mCRC patients (corresponding to 247 primary colorectal and 109 to metastatic samples) enrolled in the Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology’s Molecular Prescreening Program from June 2021 to December 2024. All samples had a tumor cellularity > 40% as per pathologist evaluation
 .
 An HR score (sHR) based on genome-wide copy number alterations (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) patterns is generated. After cross-validation with Myriad MyChoice, sHR ≥ 56 was established based on a cohort of ovarian tumors and used to identify HRD in mCRC tumor samples.
 Results:
 HRD prevalence was 3.4% in our mCRC cohort (12/356), but, much higher in metastatic lesions, (6.4%, 7/109) than in primary samples (2.03%, 5/247) (p = 0.05). In fact, the median sHR between primary (21) vs. metastases (30) in CRC was significantly different (p < 0.01). Regarding HR gene status, HR-mutated samples were not significantly within the HRD group (p = 0.27) and only 6.5% (2/31) were HRD. Noteworthy,
 BRCA2
 exhibits a frameshift deletion in a homopolymer stretch, that is a frequent hotspot in microsatellite instable (MSI) tumors, but this event was not found to be associated with HRD. In fact, all HRD tumors (n = 12) were microsatellite stable (MSS). Other frequent alterations in mCRC were studied and
 BRAF
 mutations were found to be present in 42% of HRD tumors (p < 0.01). Inversely, HRD was rare in
 KRAS
 -mutated samples (0.7%; 1/140) and, in fact, highly correlated with non-HRD status (p = 0.02), especially the G12 mutation (p < 0.01). Interestingly, CNA profiles also revealed a strong association between the
 BCL2L1
 loci gain and HRD (p < 0.01). Clinically, HRD was not significantly associated with prognostic value nor clinical benefit to oxaliplatin-based combinations. However, the limited sample size and heterogeneous treatment lines restricted robust statistical analysis.
 Conclusions:
 This study identified a small, yet significant subset of mCRC that displays HRD. sHR and HRD rates were higher in metastatic lesions vs primary tumors, indicating HR scarring could be accumulating over time in some mCRC patients. No clear association between pathogenic HR gene mutations and HRD were found, suggesting the involvement of alternative molecular mechanisms in this process. Frequent co-occurring events, such as
 BRAF
 mutations or
 BCL2L1
 gains could be drivers in CRC HRD, and shape, eventually, new therapeutic options for these patients in the metastatic setting.

It affects about one-fifth of cancer cases. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a multifaceted network of immune cells, metabolites, microbiota, stromal components, and extracellular matrix. It creates a dynamic ecosystem that supports malignant initiation, progression, and therapy resistance through bidirectional crosstalk with tumor cells. Emerging evidence reveals distinct TME landscapes shaped by wild-type versus oncogenic KRAS variants. Additionally, TME rewiring occurs during KRAS-targeted therapies. Deciphering these KRAS-dependent TME architectures and their therapeutic vulnerabilities represents a critical frontier for precision oncology. This review synthesizes key milestones and persistent challenges in KRAS inhibitor development. And it systematically evaluates how KRAS mutations orchestrated immunosuppressive niches, metabolic symbiosis, stromal remodeling, and microbiome dysbiosis, supported by mechanistic insights from preclinical and clinical studies. It further explores therapeutic opportunities arising from targeting TME interactions, including rational combinations of KRAS inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade, metabolic agents, or microbiota-modulating strategies.">

        <tr id="Focal gene amplification serves as an oncogenic driver during tumorigenesis and is a hallmark of many forms of cancer. Oncogene amplifications promote genomic instability, which is integral to cancer cell survival and evolution. However, focal gene amplification potentially affords an opportunity for therapeutic exploitation. As a proof-of-concept, we leverage CRISPR-Cas9 nickase to selectively promote cancer cell death in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma in a gene amplification-dependent manner. Our analysis demonstrates that CRISPR-Cas9 nickase can generate a lethal number of highly toxic, replication-dependent double-strand breaks in cells harboring amplified loci. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cas9 nickase—mediated toxicity can be modulated in combination with small molecule inhibitors targeting key regulators of the DNA-damage response or cell death pathways. Importantly, our findings in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma translate to other cancer types with distinct oncogene amplifications.">

        <tr id="Many chemotherapeutic agents impair cancer growth by inducing DNA damage. The impact of these agents on mutagenesis in normal cells, including sperm, is largely unknown. Here, we applied high-fidelity duplex sequencing to 94 samples from 36 individuals exposed to diverse chemotherapies and 32 controls. We found that in many of the sperm samples from men exposed to chemotherapy, the mutation burden was elevated as compared with controls and the expected burden based on trio studies, with 1 patient having a more than 10-fold increase over that expected for age. Saliva from this same individual also had a markedly higher mutation burden. We then validated this finding using other tissues, also finding an increased mutation burden in the blood and liver of many patients exposed to chemotherapy as compared with unexposed controls. Similarly, mice treated with 3 cycles of cisplatin had an increased mutation burden in sperm but also in the liver and hematopoietic progenitor cells. These results suggest an association between cancer therapies and mutation burden, with implications for counseling patients with cancer considering banking sperm before therapy and for cancer survivors considering the trade-offs of using banked sperm as compared with conceiving naturally.">

        <tr id="Akt (v-akt murine thymoma virus oncogene homologue) is a well-known serine-threonine kinase that functions as a central node in various important signal cascades involved in cellular maintenance. Akt has also been implicated in oncogenic malignancies as evidenced by protein overexpression, activation and somatic aberration of components in the phosphoinositide-3 kinase-Akt pathway. As such, Akt is a potential target in cancer therapy. Akt is frequently activated in human cancer tissues not only due to aberrant upstream signaling, but also by genetic mutations in AKT itself. This leads to the aberrant activation of pathways downstream of Akt that regulate cell-cycle progression and metabolism as well as activation of transcription factors that promote oncogenesis. In this review, we summarize previous research on Akt, including the molecular mechanisms underlying Akt signal transduction, as well as its physiologic roles and the pathologic consequences when dysregulated. We also discuss the roles of dysregulated protein overexpression/activation, increases in gene copy number, single nucleotide polymorphisms and the network of non-coding RNAs that regulate this pathway, with a particular focus on lung carcinomas. Finally, we discuss strategies that might lead to more effective targeting of Akt for clinical cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Heritable gene activity variations that do not alter the underlying DNA sequence are known as epigenetic modifications. Mutations that disrupt genome structure and function are key drivers of oncogenesis. In addition to genetic mutations that cause direct disruptions in the DNA sequence, epigenetic changes can affect gene expression, which helps the development of cancerous traits. Changes in DNA methylation and histone mark patterns are the main drivers of these epigenetic modifications, as they encourage the growth and spread of tumors. In this review, we explore the substantial implications of epigenetic control on tumor genesis, metastatic behaviour, metabolic pathways, and the tumor microenvironment, delving into the intricacies of this intricate regulation. We pay special attention to the dysregulation at every stage of epigenetic modulation, which includes, but is not limited to, abnormalities in the enzymes that modify histones and methylate DNA, subunit loss or fusions in chromatin remodeling complexes, and disruptions in higher-order chromatin structure. We also highlight the development of inhibitors of medications targeted at epigenetic enzymes and summarize the abnormal roles of enzymes in DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and histone methylation during tumour progression.">

        <tr id="The discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes provided important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of cancer but also revealed some contradictions in the prevailing somatic mutation theory. The evidence that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) form an elaborate network that regulates the flow of genetic information in eukaryotic cells offers an explanation for the inconsistencies. ncRNAs comprise a wide variety of molecules that interact with one another as well as with other RNAs, DNA, and proteins, over whose activities they exert a regulatory influence. The outcome of the dynamic interactions of the cell’s biomolecules is the emergence of higher-order states of equilibrium, called attractor states, which correspond to the gene-expression configurations of distinct cell types. Attractor states are relatively stable systems, but they are susceptible to perturbation by a disturbing force, such as mutation. Mutations that disrupt the ncRNA network can enable the cell to undergo a state transition towards a potentially neoplastic one. This is the crux of tumorigenesis. An inquiry into the architecture of the ncRNA network and its role in tumorigenesis is required to complement our knowledge of the well-known cancer genes as well as serve as a guide in the design of new anticancer therapeutics.">

        <tr id="The present report aims to improve the understanding of the clinicopathological features of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) harboring concomitant T315I and E459K mutations. CML with the T315I mutation alone and in combination with other mutations has demonstrated sensitivity to olverembatinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, providing valuable insights into potential treatment strategies for this rare mutational profile. In the present study, a 57-year-old woman with a 7-year history of CML relapsed 1 year after stopping imatinib treatment. The patient presented with right arm pain and bone lesions confirmed by imaging. Laboratory tests and bone marrow analysis confirmed CML in the chronic phase, and the patient initially responded well to dasatinib. After 5 months, severe pancytopenia developed. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed concomitant T315I and E459K mutations in the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson tyrosine kinase 1 tyrosine kinase domain, as well as an ASXL transcriptional regulator 1 mutation, indicating progression to the blast phase. Treatment was switched to olverembatinib, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was recommended. Overall, patients with multiple mutations in CML tend to have a worse prognosis due to treatment resistance and disease progression. NGS is crucial for detecting low-frequency mutations and allo-HSCT also serves a key role in treating high-risk cases.">

        <tr id="Cancer is a major global health challenge, with an estimated 19.3 million new cases by 2025, largely due to lifestyle changes, environmental factors, and increased life expectancy. Despite advances in conventional therapies, issues such as drug resistance, systemic toxicity, and relapse continue to hinder long‐term survival rates. One underexplored molecular mechanism potentially contributing to cancer progression is the enzyme Human tRNA‐dihydrouridine synthase 2 (hDus2). hDus2 plays a pivotal role in tRNA modification by converting uridine residues to dihydrouridine, enhancing tRNA structural flexibility and translational efficiency. Elevated dihydrouridine levels in tRNA have been correlated with cancer progression, highlighting hDus2 as a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we investigated the inhibition of hDus2 as a novel strategy for cancer therapy. Using in silico techniques, we screened a library of FDA‐approved drugs against the 3D structure of hDus2. Top candidate compounds identified through virtual screening with the Glide module were further evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations. Parameters such as RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, and PCA were analyzed. Additionally, binding free energy calculations were performed to validate the stability and interaction strength of the hDus2 ligand complexes. Our results identified DB09050, a cephalosporin antibiotic used for treating complicated intra‐abdominal infections, and DB00650, a folate analog, as promising hDus2 inhibitors. These findings pave the way for further development of anticancer therapeutics post‐experimental validation.">

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) showed little efficacy in pediatric solid tumors. The reconfiguration of gene regulation in cancers is a major factor in tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) remodeling and ICB resistance. Hypothesis: A subset of pediatric tumors may exhibit an epigenetically altered TiME, potentially responsible for ICB resistance. Objective: classify the TiME of pediatric extracranial solid tumors and describe the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of immune landscapes.
 Methods:
 We studied bulk tumor gene expression and DNA-methylation from 184 pediatric extracranial solid tumors. Similarity network fusion (SNFtool) individualized TiME phenotypes by dual-omic clustering of immune genes. The clusters were compared by differential analysis for gene expression and methylation. We studied the relationship of enhancer methylation to gene expression (ELMER package) to infer methylation reprogramming. An enrichment study of regulatory binding regions (ReMapEnrich) identified the master regulators that define the GRNs unique to each phenotype.
 Results:
 SNF clustering identified 3 phenotypes with 52 (28%), 83 (45%), 49 (27%) samples in clusters (cl) 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Cl1 exhibited low expression of immune genes (“cold” phenotype), cl2 overexpressed immune genes (“hot” phenotype), and cl3 featured global hypermethylation (epigenetically “altered” phenotype). Different tumor types were present across all phenotypes, but Ewing sarcoma was more frequent in altered, osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma in hot, and Wilms tumor in cold phenotype (
 p
 <0.05). Both hot and altered phenotypes overexpressed immune checkpoints (
 CD274
 ,
 PDCD1
 ), T-cell activator chemokines (
 CXCL9
 ,
 CXCL10
 ) and pro-inflammatory pathways, central to ICB sensitivity. However, only hot tumors overexpressed genes and pathways essential for antigen-presenting machinery and immune recognition. Methylation regulation was responsible for derepressing MHC-II genes and their regulators in hot tumors. In contrast, gene silencing in altered phenotype relied on hypermethylation/downregulation of the CIITA cofactor domain, the master control of MHC-II genes, and other immune-specific master regulators crucial for anti-tumor immunity and ICB sensitivity. The regulatory landscape of immune gene repression in the altered phenotype involved binding regions specific to the MYC/MAX network and the polycomb-group protein PCR2 (
 i.e.,
 EZH2 and SUZ12).
 Conclusions:
 We demonstrated that GRN reconfiguration participates in TiME reshaping in pediatric extracranial solid tumors. A subset of tumors with epigenetically altered immune phenotype has an immune recognition capacity repressed by MYC/MAX and PCR2 complexes. Future studies should investigate specific inhibitors to reprogram the GRN to foster immune recognition and ICB sensitivity.

        <tr id="Background Targeted sequencing is critical in cancer diagnosis, treatment selection, and monitoring. However, the effectiveness of these methods for reflecting whole-exome sequencing (WES)-level mutational signatures remains unclear. Therefore, we addressed this issue through simulation-based analysis to clarify how well targeted sequencing can reproduce WES-level mutational signatures. Methods We compared the correlation and similarity of mutational signatures between whole-exome sequencing-level mutation data and downsampled data for gene sets targeted by each sequencing method in 13 cancer types. Additionally, a similarity analysis of the mutational signatures was conducted using randomly downsampled data. Results The comparison between whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing showed a low correlation based on Pearson’s correlation coefficient but a high similarity based on the Dice similarity index. As a result of the downsampling of data with cancer-related genes and whole genes to evaluate similarity, the cancer-related gene random set showed high similarity when 200–400 genes were selected. However, the whole-genome random set required 2–3 times as many genes as the cancer-related gene random set to show high similarity. Among cancer types, colorectal and lung cancers demonstrated high similarity with fewer downsampled genes, whereas breast and prostate cancers required more downsampled genes to achieve high similarity. Conclusion This study demonstrated that current clinically used targeted sequencing methods can reflect whole-exome sequencing-level mutational signatures. This suggests that considering the cancer type and average number of gene mutations in each patient when selecting targeted sequencing methods can lead to more effective treatment choices.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy characterized by complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment, where mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contribute significantly to disease progression, immune suppression, and drug resistance. Methods This study investigated the heterogeneity of MSCs in multiple myeloma using single-cell RNA sequencing (10X) and bulk transcriptomic data. Further analysis was performed by Seurat, SCENIC, CellChat. GSE4581 and GSE136337 were used as training set and validation set to construct a newly described prognostic model through COX and LASSO. Results By analyzing bone marrow samples from healthy donors and multiple myeloma patients at different Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) stages, this study identified distinct MSC subpopulations, including osteogenic, angiogenic, immune regulatory, and multipotent clusters, each of which plays unique roles in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found a unique subclone with upregulated expression of high mobility group proteins, these MSC exert a strong regulatory effect, which was defined as “HMGhMSC”. Conclusions Our findings reveal that the proportion of osteogenic MSCs, which are crucial for bone health, decreases as the disease progresses, which is correlated with the bone lysis commonly observed in advanced multiple myeloma. Additionally, immune regulatory MSCs contribute to the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, promoting tumor immune evasion. A prognostic model based on HMGhMSC subpopulations was developed, which demonstrated that these cells have significant potential as therapeutic targets for improving the prognosis and developing treatments for bone disease in multiple myeloma patients.

        <tr id="Research on myeloid neoplasms, a field that has been driving scientific advances in cancer for over 50 years, has yielded many discoveries that have fundamentally reshaped our understanding of cancer biology. These insights, often the product of leukemia research, have been instrumental in developing more mechanism-based treatments in the early 2000s [1]. Recognizing epigenetic dysregulation as a common disease mechanism in myeloid cancers has been groundbreaking regarding recent treatment developments that exploit chromatin-based oncogenic mechanisms. In the case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), sequencing studies aimed at assessing the complement of genetic alterations demonstrated that more than 60% of AML cases harbored disease-driving mutations in epigenetic regulators. This high prevalence underscores the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in AML pathogenesis [2, 3]. Chromatin regulators commonly control disease-specific transcriptional programs, making them attractive therapeutic targets to manipulate neoplastic gene expression programs, particularly in myeloid neoplasms. Several drugs targeting epigenetic mechanisms and exploiting myeloid disease-specific dependencies have recently been approved for treating myeloid neoplasms. Many additional drugs are currently being investigated in clinical trials, and numerous new compound developments are being studied in preclinical studies. This manuscript will review (1) chromatin-based disease mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, chromatin regulatory complexes, and histone modifications, currently investigated for therapeutic exploitation in myeloid malignancies, and (2) therapeutic developments already approved or investigated for treating these diseases.">

        <tr id="Background Aberrant function or overactivation of exonuclease 1 (EXO1) may be associated with cancer tumor development, drug resistance, and response to immunotherapy in female-related cancers. Methods By analyzing RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, combined with validation through quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments, we explored the expression levels of EXO1 in breast cancer (BRCA) cell lines and assessed its multidimensional roles in various female-related cancers. Results Our experiments revealed elevated expression of EXO1 in BRCA cell lines, consistent with the RNA-sequencing data. The high expression of EXO1 is associated with poor prognosis in various female-related cancers, especially in BRCA and UCEC. It significantly correlates with clinical and pathological characteristics. In specific cancer subtypes like the basal-like subtype of BRCA, high EXO1 expression is associated with a better prognosis. Genetic mutation analysis indicates a higher frequency of EXO1 gene mutations in uterine sarcoma and BRCA. DNA methylation levels may play a role in the regulation of EXO1 gene expression in some cancers. EXO1 expression is correlated with various factors within the tumor immune microenvironment and may be associated with the sensitivity to anticancer drugs. Conclusion EXO1 exhibits multidimensional roles in female-related cancers as a prognostic biomarker and potentially influences tumor immune therapy responses and drug sensitivities. Further studies are needed to fully understand the complex mechanisms underlying these associations and to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting EXO1.">

 The Mismatch Repair (MMR) pathway, a crucial tumor suppressor mechanism, is dysregulated across cancer types. We previously identified the loss of the MutL complex of the MMR pathway, as a key factor inducing resistance to endocrine therapy in Estrogen Receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients. Preliminary data previously generated in the lab supports a role for MutL loss in promoting metastasis of ER+ breast cancer. A mammary-specific knockout mouse model for MLH1, a principal component of MutL, created in the Haricharan lab develops aggressive mammary tumors that metastasize to multiple organs. To unveil the mechanism by which MLH1 loss triggers metastasis, an unbiased RPPA and RNA-Seq was conducted which revealed cytokine secretion in the immune system as a distinctive signature of MLH1- ER+ breast cancer cells. The tumor secretome, particularly cytokines, can manipulate macrophage plasticity to skew polarization states towards either an anti- or pro- metastatic phenotype. Secreted cytokine levels altered by MLH1 loss were identified in multiple ER+ breast cancer cells lines from concentrated conditioned media. Additionally, in vivo experiments with xenograft MLH1- ER+ tumors in nude mice, revealed an elevated number of CD206 expressing tumor-promoting M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, MLH1- ER+ breast cancer cells grown in the presence of macrophages exhibit an increase in their migratory capacity. Our preliminary data strongly indicate that loss of MLH1 alters the ER+ breast cancer secretome and alters macrophage maturation, suggesting a role for MLH1 in immunomodulation supporting metastatic progression. Investigation of this new role will uncover key tumor-intrinsic drivers of “cold” tumor immune microenvironment profiles and present unique opportunities for therapeutic interventions to convert them into “hot” profiles, thereby improving ER+ breast cancer patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Mutation spectra vary across genetic and environmental contexts, leading to differences between and within species. Most research on mutation spectrum has focused on the trinucleotide (3-mer) mutation types in mammals, limiting the breadth and depth of variation surveyed. In this study, we use whole-genome resequencing data across 108 eukaryotic species – including mammals, fish, plants, and invertebrates – to characterize pentanucleotide (5-mer) non-coding mutation spectra using a Bayesian approach. Our findings reveal cytosine transition mutability at CpG and (among plants) at CHG sites as the main drivers of variation in mutation spectra across eukaryotes, correlating strongly with genomic CpG and CHG depletion. However, despite the influence of methylation on CpG mutability, genome-wide average CpG methylation levels do not predict CpG transition rates across species and CHG methylation does not predict CHG transition rate, indicating unknown genetic or environmental factors influencing mutation rates at methylated cytosines. Together, our results illustrate the pivotal role of mutagenesis in shaping genome composition across eukaryotes and highlight a gap in knowledge about the mechanisms governing mutation rates.">

        <tr id="Background: Recent large-scale sequencing studies reveal that up to 18% of children with cancer harbor pathogenic variants (PV) in known cancer predisposing genes (CPG). However, many patients exhibit features of an underlying predisposition but lack CPG PV. This observation suggests the presence of unidentified cancer predisposing variants and/or genes. To address this gap, we interrogated genes implicated in DNA damage repair (DDR) as a source of novel cancer predisposing signals that could account for this missing heritability. Methods: We examined germline data from 5,993 childhood cancer cases and 14,477 adult non-cancer controls for damaging variants among 189 DDR genes. Damaging variants were defined as rare (allele frequency <0.05% in the gnomAD v2.1 non-cancer subset), nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site, and missense with REVEL scores >0.7. Enrichment of damaging variants was determined using logistic and firth regression models. Putative novel CPG were replicated using data from 1,494 additional childhood cancer cases in three independent cohorts. Findings: Pan-cancer analyses revealed enrichment of germline TP53 variants (false discovery rate [FDR]logistic=0.0066, FDRFirth=0.0064). Cancer-specific analyses demonstrated significant associations for TP53 in adrenocortical carcinoma (37%, FDRlogistic<0.0001, FDRFirth=0) and high-grade glioma (2.4%, FDRlogistic=0.0022, FDRFirth=0.1082), as well as BARD1 in neuroblastoma (1.2%, FDRlogistic=0.0341, FDRFirth=0.2682). Three novel gene-tumor associations were identified, including POLL in Ewing sarcoma (1.7%, FDRlogistic=0.0319, FDRFirth=0.3101), SMC5 in medulloblastoma (1.6%, FDRlogistic=0.0005, FDRFirth=0.0499) and SMARCAL1 in osteosarcoma (2.6%, FDRlogistic=0.0250, FDRFirth=0.2180). Among these new putative CPG, enrichment of SMARCAL1 PV in osteosarcoma was replicated across all three additional pediatric cancer cohorts (2.5%, PFisher <0.0001). All osteosarcoma tumors (n=3) with whole genome sequencing data available exhibited deletion of the wild-type SMARCAL1 allele. Interpretation: We report a catalogue of germline SMARCAL1 variants in pediatric osteosarcoma and demonstrate potential molecular effects in tumor formation through the presence of second somatic SMARCAL1 hits. The contribution of germline POLL and SMC5 variants in Ewing sarcoma and medulloblastoma, respectively, warrants further investigation. Our study highlights the power of unbiased genomic investigations to uncover novel CPG, providing insights into tumor biology and creating opportunities for therapeutic intervention, surveillance, and prevention.

        <tr id="Objective. This study describes mutations of genes that stimulate and regulate cell growth, programmed cell death, DNA repair, and cell growth suppression in a boy with osteosarcoma. 
Case Report. We report a case of bone sarcoma in a 9-year-old boy with possible familial predisposition. In our patient, only a subset of tumor cells expressed the ATRX protein, which is known to control the expression of several genome regions. The function of the p53 protein, which acts as a transcription factor that regulates the DNA damage repair response, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis pathways, is lost in 40-50% of malignant cells. Retinoblastoma was positive in the predominant subset of tumor cells. Deletion is found on chromosome 9, cytoband 9p21.3, where the genes for CDKN2A and CDKN2B are located. Neoplastic cells were SATB2-positive in a substantial subset, with nu- clear staining. The SATB2 protein is a DNA-binding protein involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. Chromosomal losses of 8p and 19q11-q13.43 were also found. These regions contain several tumor suppressor genes, including NKX3.1, whose reduced expression correlates with 8p loss in high-grade tumors. Although there was no known cancer syn- drome in the family, the maternal grandfather had a similar tumor requiring amputation. 
Conclusion. Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of osteosarcoma and is characterized by heterogeneous and extensive genetic complexity. Various numerical and structural genomic rearrangements have been described in cancer cells. However, there is little consistent genetic change to understand the etiopathogenesis of this aggressive tumor.">

        <tr id="Aggressive and therapy-resistant glioblastoma is among the most lethal malignant tumors in humans. Complete surgical resection is often unachievable; therefore, combination chemoradiotherapy is used to target tumor cells residual beyond the resection margin. This approach induces DNA damage in tumor cells and activates the apoptosis pathway. Unfortunately, recurrence remains a major clinical challenge, frequently manifesting as more aggressive and treatmentresistant glioblastoma phenotypes. The DNA repair and damage response (DDR) pathways are critical for maintaining genome stability. While defects in these mechanisms contribute to oncogenesis, they also make tumor cells vulnerable to DNA-damaging therapy, as the cells become dependent on residual repair capacity. It is of paramount importance to understand the molecular components of these mechanisms and to identify potential therapeutic/pharmacological targets for improving outcomes in glioblastoma patients. A subpopulation of stem-like cells, designated as glioblastoma cancer stem cells (CSCs), has been identified as a critical factor in the initiation, maintenance, and recurrence of tumors. These cells exhibit therapy resistance due to enhanced DNA repair capacity. In addition, emerging evidence suggests a link between carbohydrate metabolism and DNA repair pathways, thereby revealing novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in glioblastoma. This review examines current strategies targeting DNA repair mechanisms in glioblastoma. We present a synopsis of recent advancements in research concerning the mechanisms and factors involved in the elimination of DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation and temozolomide (TMZ). Furthermore, we explore the potential of DNA repair pathway inhibitors under investigation in preclinical and clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Disorders of sex development (DSDs) are characterized by discrepancies among karyotype, the gonadal phenotype and gonadal anatomy following birth. Among these, 46, XY DSD is the most complex sub-type and a major cause of birth defects associated with sexual development. However, due to the considerable heterogeneity in pathogenic genes, numerous cases remain genetically undiagnosed. In the present study, a novel gain-of-function variant was identified in the mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase 1 (MAP3K1) gene, contributing to 46, XY DSD through the induction of abnormal cell apoptosis. Genetic analysis of a pediatric male patient and his family revealed a heterozygous MAP3K1 c.4445 G>A variant, resulting in an arginine-to-glutamine substitution. The variant site is highly conserved across species and the amino acid transition induced structural changes in the MAP3K1 protein. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the MAP3K1 c.4445 G>A variant markedly increased apoptotic signaling, leading to abnormal cell apoptosis, disruption of the cell cycle and reduced cell viability. Moreover, the variant exhibited increased levels of ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation, indicative of a gain-of-function effect. Subsequent analysis revealed increased expression of the testis-determining gene, SOX9 and reduced expression of the ovary-determining gene, FOXL2. Notably, alterations in gene expression were associated with the MAP3K1 c.4445 G>A variant, providing a mechanistic basis for the pathogenesis of 46, XY DSD. Collectively, these findings offer novel insights into the anti-apoptotic role of MAP3K1, advancing genetic diagnosis and pre-natal screening for individuals with DSDs.">

This perspective focuses on the state-of-the-art methodology of CRISPR knock-ins to engineer immune cells. Since this technique relies on homology-directed repair (HDR) of double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by the Cas9 enzyme, it can be used to introduce specific mutations into the target genome. Therefore, this methodology offers a valuable opportunity to functionally study specific mutations and to uncover their impacts not only on overall cell functions but also on the mechanisms behind cancer-related alterations in common signaling pathways.

        <tr id="Cell heterogeneity is a universal feature of life. Although biological processes affected by cell-to-cell variation are manifold, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity and differential drug responses, the sources of cell heterogeneity remain largely unclear1,2. Mutational and epigenetic signatures from cancer (epi)genomics are powerful for deducing processes that shaped cancer genome evolution3–5. However, retrospective analyses face difficulties in resolving how cellular heterogeneity emerges and is propagated to subsequent cell generations. Here, we used multigenerational single-cell tracking based on endogenously labelled proteins and custom-designed computational tools to elucidate how oncogenic perturbations induce sister cell asymmetry and phenotypic heterogeneity. Dual CRISPR-based genome editing enabled simultaneous tracking of DNA replication patterns and heritable endogenous DNA lesions. Cell lineage trees of up to four generations were tracked in asynchronously growing cells, and time-resolved lineage analyses were combined with end-point measurements of cell cycle and DNA damage markers through iterative staining. Besides revealing replication and repair dynamics, damage inheritance and emergence of sister cell heterogeneity across multiple cell generations, through combination with single-cell transcriptomics, we delineate how common oncogenic events trigger multiple routes towards polyploidization with distinct outcomes for genome integrity. Our study provides a framework to dissect phenotypic plasticity at the single-cell level and sheds light onto cellular processes that may resemble early events during cancer development.">

        <tr id="Background Cancer cells achieve replicative immortality through telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs), primarily via telomerase activation or alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Sarcomas frequently employ the ALT pathway, which traditionally correlates with adverse clinical outcomes. However, chondrosarcomas represent a unique context where the role and prognostic significance of ALT remain largely unexplored. Methods We performed comprehensive analyses of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from patients with chondrosarcoma and integrated this with 90 bulk RNA-seq datasets. This approach enabled detailed characterization of TMM at single-cell resolution, identification of ALT-specific signatures, and evaluation of the tumor microenvironment in chondrosarcomas. Results Patients with ALT-like chondrosarcomas exhibited significantly improved survival compared to those with non-ALT-like chondrosarcomas. Analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment revealed distinct metabolic and immune landscapes between the ALT-like and non-ALT-like groups. Single-cell analysis showed that high-entropy stem-like cells in high-grade chondrosarcomas predominantly adopted telomerase activation over the ALT pathway as their TMM. Additionally, we identified a 100-gene signature that reliably distinguishes ALT-like chondrosarcomas, providing a robust molecular marker for classification and prognosis. Conclusions Our study reveals ALT-like state as a marker of favorable prognosis in chondrosarcomas—contrasting with its typically adverse implications in other sarcomas. We establish a robust 100-gene signature that reliably identifies ALT-like chondrosarcomas and characterize their distinct immune microenvironment profile. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="Over the past half-century of the global effort against cancer, the vast majority of investigations in both tumor basic research and clinical practice have centered on the "somatic mutation" theory, such as in molecular classification, individualized precision medicine strategies, gene therapy approaches, the development of neoantigen-based tumor vaccines, and advancements in sequencing technologies. Even in the extensively studied tumor microenvironment (including tumor immunity), which has garnered significant attention in recent years, the underlying mechanisms frequently revert to specific genes and mutations within tumor cells or microenvironmental cells as the primary driving forces. However, despite the dominance of the "somatic mutation" paradigm, truly effective approaches for curing cancer in clinical settings remain elusive. Undoubtedly, if the prevailing "somatic mutation theory" continues to monopolize cancer research, meaningful progress in understanding and treating cancer will likely remain frustratingly out of reach. At this critical juncture in the evolution of cancer research, a comprehensive re-evaluation of cancer not only is necessary but also imperative, highlighting the urgent need for a profound transformation in our conceptual framework. This article systematically elucidates the novel perspective offered by the "tumor system" for comprehending the essence of cancer, the foundational principles of "tumor ecology" and their potential applications in treatment, and explores in depth the theoretical framework and research significance of the emerging field of "ecological pathology". Beyond merely advocating for the abandonment of the currently dominant linear reductionist paradigm of cancer, this commentary strives to construct a pragmatic and systematically structured framework to guide the trajectory of the "post-genomic revolution in oncology" and the "tumor ecological philosophy", ultimately fostering the realization of the overarching societal goal of eradicating cancer.">

        <tr id="Mutations in TP53 are mutually exclusive with other known drivers of myeloid transformation and define a distinct molecular subtype within de novo Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) that is associated with a complex karyotype, resistance to chemotherapy, and poor prognosis. Although TP53 defects are rare in de novo AML, biallelic mutations are a defining molecular feature of erythroleukemia. The genetic alterations that cooperate with defective TP53 to transform erythroid progenitors remain unknown. We found that loss of BAP1 (BRCA1 Associated Protein-1) co-occurs in one-third of patients with TP53-mutated AML, is associated with an erythroid-primed gene expression signature, and confers an additional adverse effect on overall survival. BAP1 is a tumor suppressor involved in the DNA damage response as well as epigenetic regulation through histone H2AK119 de-ubiquitination. While Bap1KO mice develop myelodysplasia with prominent dyserythropoiesis, combined deletion of Bap1 and Trp53 caused transplantable erythroleukemia, and occasionally mixed AML, mirroring the heterogeneity of human disease. Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq coupled to ChIP-seq in hematopoietic progenitors revealed that Bap1 loss triggers a proinflammatory response and cooperates with Trp53 deficiency to transform erythroid-primed multipotent progenitors. Mechanistically, genomic instability led to the development of erythroleukemia, while epigenetic deregulation caused myelomonocytic skewing suggesting a dichotomous and context dependent role for BAP1. We also demonstrate that BAP1 deficient erythroleukemia is dependent on BCL2L1 expression and is sensitive to BCL-xL inhibitors in vivo.">

Recent advances in CRISPR–Cas9–based genome editing have revolutionized cancer
immunotherapy by enabling precise and efficient T-cell engineering. This review focuses on how
CRISPR-mediated modifications enhance T-cell functionality, highlighting key applications, such
as CAR-T cells and TCR-engineered T-cell therapies. By selectively targeting immune-regulating
genes, CRISPR empowers T cells to recognize and eliminate tumor cells with greater specificity
and reduce off-target effects. This precision opens the door to personalized treatment strategies, allowing
T cells to be tailored to each patient’s unique tumor profile. Furthermore, the ability to
rapidly and systematically edit multiple gene targets has accelerated the development of more potent
and durable T-cell therapies, overcoming some of the current limitations in cancer immunotherapy.
Overall, CRISPR’s transformative potential of CRISPR provides a platform for next-
generation patient-centric cancer treatments, paving the way for improved clinical outcomes and
expanded therapeutic options.

        <tr id="Embryogenesis and tumorigenesis share several key biological characteristics, such as rapid cell proliferation, high plasticity, and immune evasion. This similarity indicates that developmental pathways can be hijacked, leading to the formation of malignant cell states. With regard to this, cancer can be regarded as a stem cell disease. On the contrary, a fetus, in many ways, has similar characteristics to the “ideal tumor”, such as immune evasion and rapid growth. Therefore, deciphering the molecular mechanisms beneath these phenomena will help us to understand the embryonic origins of cancer. This review discusses the relationship between embryogenesis and tumorigenesis, highlighting the potential roles played by DUX4. DUX4 is involved in the activation of the zygote genome and then facilitates the establishment of totipotency in pre-implantation embryos, whereas the misexpression of DUX4 is associated with different types of cancer. Taken together, this indicates that DUX4 performs analogous functions in these two processes and connects embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. Through examining DUX4, this review underscores the importance of developmental mechanisms in cancer biology, suggesting that the insights gained from studying embryonic processes may provide novel therapeutic strategies. As we continue to explore the complex relationship between cancer and embryogenesis, elucidating the role of DUX4 in linking these two processes will be critical for developing targeted therapies that exploit developmental pathways.">

        <tr id="Abrogating the immunoevasive role of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) represents a critical yet still elusive challenge in cancer treatment. Progress in this area has been hampered by both technological limitations and incomplete understanding of TIME-dependent immunoevasion mechanisms. We hypothesize that the immune-evasive role of TIME subpopulations—including regulatory T cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and tumor-associated macrophages—is critically mediated by hyperconnected Master Regulator Checkpoint (MRC) modules whose aberrant activity, as induced by paracrine signals, can be abrogated or modulated either genetically or pharmacologically. MRCs are primarily composed of transcription and co-transcription factors, acting downstream of surface receptors and signal transduction cascades to control the transcriptional identity and, ultimately, the phenotype of individual TIME subpopulations. Pharmacological inhibition of subpopulation-specific MRC proteins can thus help reprogram the TIME and potentially abrogate or modulate its immunosuppressive state. This paradigm shift, away from single ligand/receptor targeting, is supported by recent algorithmic, experimental, and clinical advances allowing systematic identification of MRCs and their pharmacological modulators using systems immunology-based approaches. Refocusing the deployment of existing tools and experimental methods that have proven successful in tumor cell contexts to identify and validate MRC-targeting agents capable of remodeling the immunosuppressive cell states of the tumor microenvironment can potentially pave the road to novel combination therapy synergizing with immune checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is characterized by high malignancy, and its global incidence is predicted to continue to increase over the past decades. However, the mechanisms underlying ICC pathogenesis and progression remain unclear.


APPROACH AND RESULTS
The training cohort consisted of single-cell sequencing of 12 treatment-naïve ICC samples and spatial transcriptomics of four ICC samples. The validation cohort comprised of RNA-seq data from 87 ICC tumor samples. Finally, we validated our findings via multiplex immunofluorescence, organoids, and mice models both in vivo and in vitro. We found significant heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of ICC patients. ICC cells were classified into five molecular subtypes, and we revealed that aspartate beta-hydroxylase (ASPH) was a marker gene for invasion subtypes. We then selected cepharanthine (CEP) as an ASPH inhibitor that effectively suppressed tumor progression. Regarding the ICC lymphatic metastasis mechanism, we found that tumor cells in N1 lymph nodes highly expressed tumor-specific MHC-II molecules but lacked co-stimulatory factors CD80/CD86, inducing a state of anergy in CD4+ T cells, which might facilitate ICC immune evasion.


CONCLUSIONS
The TME of ICC was heterogeneous. ASPH markedly enhanced ICC invasion The ASPH inhibitor CEP significantly inhibits ICC progression and may serve as a targeted therapeutic drug for ICC. Tumor cells in N1 lymph nodes demonstrate high expression of tumor-specific MHC-II molecules, but silencing of co-stimulatory factors such as CD80/CD86 induces CD4+ T cells into an anergic state. Our study indicated that ASPH and MHC-II may serve as novel therapeutic targets for ICC.">

        <tr id="The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was the first member of a broad family of growth factor receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. While lung cancer commonly exhibits point mutations and minor insertions within the kinase domain, brain tumours typically exhibit high abundance of EGFR and massive internal deletions. These factors led to the widespread use of EGFR and HER2/ERBB2 as targets for anti-cancer treatments. The association between EGFR expression and cancer prognosis is investigated in this review paper. EGFR, when activated by a ligand, starts a sequence of time-dependent molecular switches that govern genes that determine phenotype. These switches include up-regulation of freshly synthesised mRNAs, down-regulation of a large cohort of microRNAs, and covalent protein changes. Long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs, in addition to microRNAs, are essential for EGFR signalling. EGFR is a multifaceted driver of metastasis, in addition to driver mutations. Targeted therapies against EGFR, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, have significantly improved treatment outcomes in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. In this review, we discussed about how EGFR overexpression and mutations affect different types of human malignancies. Finally, we evaluated all anti-cancer medications that have received clinical approval that target EGFR and discuss recent advancements in therapy as well as in future possibilities.">

        <tr id="Segmental duplications (SDs) are blocks of genomic DNA with high sequence homology that are hotspots for chromosomal rearrangements, coinciding with copy-number and single-nucleotide variations in the population. SDs could represent unstable genomic regions that are susceptible to somatic alterations in human cancers. Here, we aimed to elucidate the genomic locations of SDs in relation to cancer-related genes and their propensity for somatic alterations in cancer. The analysis showed that tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) were less associated with SDs compared to non-cancer genes in nearly all mammalian species. TSGs with SDs were larger in size in humans but only modestly conserved among mammals. In humans, the proportion of non-cancer genes with SDs decreased as the gene age increased. However, for TSGs, a loss of association with SDs was apparent among young genes. Pan-cancer analysis revealed that TSGs with SDs were more prone to deletions and structural variations independently of gene size. Re-analysis of publicly available experimental data further revealed that genes with SDs tended to replicate late and were more likely to undergo the error-prone mitotic DNA synthesis upon replication stress. In conclusion, the loss of SDs from TSGs during mammalian evolution protects against tumor formation by reducing somatic alterations.">

        <tr id="The transcription factor PAX5 is a major target of genetic alterations in human B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Among the alterations, the P80R mutation affecting the DNA-binding domain represents the most frequent PAX5 point mutation in B-ALL. In contrast to other somatic PAX5 mutations, PAX5P80R defines a distinct B-ALL subtype characterized by a unique transcriptional program. Here, we aimed to develop a model to elucidate the mechanism by which PAX5P80R perturbs normal B-cell differentiation and the oncogenic relays involved in PAX5P80R-driven malignant progression. A retroviral complementation approach of Pax5-deficient murine fetal liver cells demonstrated at the functional and molecular levels that PAX5P80R failed to rescue definitive B-cell commitment but maintained the repression of T-cell development. Moreover, PAX5P80R eventually led to clonal B-ALL transformation after transplantation through the acquisition of secondary mutations in genes involved in the JAK/STAT and RAS/MAPK pathways. Finally, transcriptomic analyses combined with pharmacological investigation revealed ectopic activation of HIF2α as a common feature of B-ALL and identified acriflavine as a potent drug against B-ALL. Hence, this study provides a strategy to model the multistep process of B-ALL and sheds light on the biological mechanism by which the PAX5P80R mutation leads to leukemia.">

DSCC1 is reported to have increased expression in tumor progression, but the underlying mechanisms of DSCC1 in tumor immunity remain obscure. Methods: Data were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to obtain DSCC1 expression and clinicopathologically relevant data. Differential expression of DSCC1 and its association with prognosis, tumor microenvironment, immune infiltration, immune regulation, and genomic stability in various cancers were analyzed using R software. Results: The results of pan-cancer analysis showed that DSCC1 expression was elevated in 22 tumors. In 15 tumors, high expression of DSCC1 was observed to correlate with dismal overall survival. Furthermore, a correlation between DSCC1 expression and immune checkpoints was determined. In addition, DSCC1 expression was correlated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells, especially in Thymoma (THYM). Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that DSCC1 is critically involved in tumor proliferation, immunity, and metabolism. Conclusions: High DSCC1 expression is found in many common tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. The gene is an essential factor in sister chromatid cohesion and may contribute to tumor progression by affecting the tumor immune microenvironment and genomic stability. DSCC1 has the potential to be a prognostic marker, and therapies targeting it may benefit patients.">

        <tr id="Accurate and timely detection of clinically relevant genetic abnormalities, such as CBFB::MYH11 or inversion(16) [inv(16)], is critical for the diagnosis and management of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Notably, CBFB::MYH11 is a disease-defining mutation in AML and is associated with a favorable prognosis. The current standard-of-care workup, which includes a combination of conventional G-banding karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and/or reverse-transcriptase PCR, poses challenges in detecting variant CBFB::MYH11 translocations. High-resolution, genome-wide technologies capable of accurate and unbiased detection of chromosomal structural aberrations at the gene/exon level, such as optical genome mapping (OGM), will be helpful for the timely detection of clinically actionable abnormalities. This case report presents a patient initially diagnosed with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) following cytotoxic therapy and treated with a hypomethylating agent, who later experienced progression to AML with CBFB::MYH11. Retrospective analysis of the initial diagnostic sample using OGM revealed a cryptic CBFB::MYH11 abnormality at the time of the first presentation. Furthermore, OGM enabled comprehensive characterization of this novel CBFB::MYH11 transcript with noncanonical breakpoints, which were not detected by standard molecular techniques. This case highlights a critical diagnostic blind spot in the detection of CBF::MYH11 AML, representing a missed opportunity to offer effective frontline therapy to a patient with potentially curable AML-an aberration not recognized by conventional karyotype or FISH at the time of initial diagnosis. The implementation of genome-wide technologies such as OGM as a first-tier diagnostic tool in clinical laboratories for the workup of MDS/AML is essential for detecting clinically impactful cryptic genomic alterations.

        <tr id="PARP inhibitors (PARPi), recently introduced for treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), have heightened interest in molecular profiling for pathogenic aberrations in homologous recombination DNA repair (HRR) genes in all mCRPC patients. Liquid biopsy offers a viable alternative to archival tumor tissue for genetic analysis. In this study, we assessed the feasibility and utility of combining mutational panel sequencing with shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) to refine HRR status determination from plasma in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. The mutational profile of 16 HRR genes was assessed in 63 PCa patients: 28.6% of patients harbored putative pathogenic variants in HRR-related genes. A HRR-mutant status was defined for 10 patients (15.8%). Through the integration of sWGS data, plasma samples non-informative about somatic alterations were identified, and germline/somatic origin of HRR mutations was defined. Matched tumor tissue was available for 41 patients, with an 85.7% concordance rate between plasma and tissue mutational analyses. Additionally, we explored the copy number variation (CNV) profile using sWGS and it was found concordant with the literature PCa profiles. Our findings demonstrated that ctDNA analysis through liquid biopsy is a reliable alternative to tissue-based methods for identifying SNVs and CNVs. However, concordance was affected by ctDNA levels in plasma and clonal hematopoiesis. The data highlight the utility of integrating sWGS with targeted mutation analysis for comprehensive molecular profiling of PCa patients.

        <tr id="Double‐strand breaks (DSBs) are universally acknowledged as the most detrimental type of DNA damage, and their effective repair primarily depends on the non‐homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Such DSBs, which require NHEJ for resolution, can arise from intrinsic and extrinsic DNA‐damaging factors or emerge naturally during essential biological processes like V(D)J recombination and antibody class switch recombination.Failure to properly repair DSBs may lead to genomic instability, disruption of cellular functions, and immunodeficiency, thereby promoting the development of hematologic malignancies. Conversely, overexpression of NHEJ‐related genes can enhance resistance to DNA‐damaging therapies in these cancers. Analyzing mutations in key classical NHEJ (cNHEJ) components and understanding their mechanisms could provide valuable biomarkers for predicting therapeutic outcomes and guiding treatment decisions. Consequently, defects in cNHEJ may offer insights into the development of novel drugs targeting DNA repair pathways.We focus on genetic changes and alterations in gene regulation, while also providing an overview of cNHEJ.">

 A deeper understanding of the complicated transcriptional landscape of human breast cancers are vital to identifying more efficacious treatments. Investigating genetic variations among breast cancer subtypes at a single-cell level holds the potential to enhance our understanding of cancer formation, progression, and elucidate actionable targets. In this study, we compile single-cell RNA sequencing data from patient tumors and matched lymph metastasis, reduction mammoplasties, breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs), and cell lines, forming a diverse dataset consisting of 117 samples with a total of 506,719 cells. These samples include hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes, along with isogenic model pairs. Within this study, we outline the similarities and differences across these models and patient samples, and assess therapeutic drug efficacy based on subtype proportions. Within the TNBC subtype, PDX models exhibited a closer resemblance to patient samples in terms of tumor heterogeneity and cell cycle features compared to cell lines. Acquired drug resistance in TNBC PDX tumors was linked to an increase in basal-like cell proportions, as defined by SCSubtype and TNBCtype cell typing predictors. Cell-wise subtyping revealed all patient samples comprised a mix of subtypes; notably, HR+ lymph node metastases had a lower proportion of HER2-Enriched cells compared to matched primary tumors. PDXOs displayed differences in metabolic-related transcripts relative to matched PDX tumors. Correlative analyses of cytotoxic drugs on PDX cells demonstrated that therapeutic efficacy was dependent on subtype proportions. Herein we provide an extensive multi-model dataset, a dynamic approach to cell-wise sample annotation, and a thorough examination of models within human breast cancer systems. This analysis and reference resource will support informed decision-making in preclinical research and therapeutic development by establishing model limitations, subtype-specific insights, and novel targetable pathways.

 How can we improve the safety and efficiency of germline gene correction using CRISPR/Cas9 in early mouse embryos?



 We observed a higher frequency of desirable gene editing events when using crRNA XT for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene correction during fertilization of mouse oocytes.



 CRISPR/Cas9 induces double-stranded DNA breaks, which can be repaired via homology-directed repair (HDR) using a repair template to achieve precise gene editing. Undesired events may occur, including non-homologous end joining, leading to error-prone repair causing insertions or deletions (indels), unrepaired DNA breaks resulting in large deletions or partial chromosomal loss, or HDR using the untargeted parental chromosome (gene conversion), causing loss of heterozygosity.
 HDR frequencies in early embryos are typically much lower compared to gene editing outcomes in somatic cell lines. In this study, we aimed to improve HDR efficiency by using chemically modified crRNA optimized for high nuclease environments.



 To achieve gene correction with reduced mosaicism, we co-injected CRISPR/Cas9 along with mutant C57BL/6J mouse sperm (carrying a homozygous Plcz1 deletion, causing failed fertilization after ICSI) into wild-type B6D2F1 and DBA/2 mouse oocytes for subsequent developmental and detailed genetic analysis, respectively.
 We analysed 59 embryos injected with crRNA XT and 60 embryos injected with classical crRNA. The repair template used contained synonymous variants, which, if detected, indicate successful gene correction through HDR with template use.



 We injected CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, designed for correcting the Plcz1 deletion, simultaneously with mutant mouse sperm into wild-type mouse oocytes during piezo-assisted ICSI, followed by artificial activation. We compared the use of crRNA XT, containing additional modifications for improved functional stability, to classical crRNA. After four days of in vitro culture, DNA was extracted and used for targeted sequencing, whole genome amplification, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis to evaluate the events following gene editing.



 After gene correction using classical crRNA, targeted sequencing revealed that the deletion was undetectable in 8 out of 60 embryos (13.3%). However, none of these embryos contained the synonymous variants which would indicate HDR with the provided repair template. In contrast, using crRNA XT, the deletion was no longer detected in 22 out of 59 embryos (37.3%). The synonymous variants were found in 50% of the embryos with undetectable deletions, suggesting a remarkable increase in HDR rates with the repair template. These results indicate that crRNA XT, with its enhanced stability, leads to a remarkable improvement in the frequency of desired gene editing events.
 To explain further the events in which the deletion is no longer detected without incorporation of the repair template’s synonymous variants, we performed whole-genome amplification and copy number variation (CNV) analysis using shallow whole-genome sequencing. In the embryos edited using classical crRNA, we observed partial chromosomal loss of chromosome 6 (carrying the Plcz1 gene) in 1 out of 7 analysed embryos and aneuploidy with partial chromosomal loss of chromosome 6 in 1 out of 7 analysed embryos. CNV analysis of embryos edited with crRNA XT is still ongoing to complete our comparison.



 The resolution of the shallow whole-genome sequencing is limited to 5 Mbp. To detect larger deletions smaller than this threshold, we will perform long-read sequencing.



 Targeted sequencing of embryos undergoing early gene correction for the Plcz1 deletion revealed that the use of crRNA XT, which offers greater stability, significantly enhanced the frequency of HDR with the repair template compared to classical crRNA. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of germline gene editing events.

        <tr id="Mutations and gene rearrangements are crucial for the diagnosis and subtyping of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the contribution of non-coding genetic variants, particularly those within cis-regulatory elements (CREs), to AML pathophysiology and heterogeneity remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterize the single-cell chromatin accessibility landscapes of 10 bone marrow samples from AML patients at diagnosis. Additionally, we develop eMut, an integrated computational pipeline for detecting, imputing, and functionally characterizing non-coding mutations in CREs at the single-cell level. Our analysis identifies 2878 potential somatic non-coding mutations, highlighting the extensive mutational heterogeneity in the non-coding genome of AML patients, with recurrent non-coding mutations displaying cell type-specific patterns. We show that mutated CREs are enriched with blood-related genetic variants, potentially linked to AML-associated genes, and harbor a higher abundance of functional CREs, suggesting their functional relevance in leukemogenesis. Importantly, we pinpoint candidate functional non-coding mutations that associate with alteration of target gene expression in AML. Collectively, our work provides a comprehensive resource of single-cell chromatin accessibility in AML and introduces an integrative approach to identify candidate functional non-coding mutations contributing to cellular heterogeneity in AML.">

The transcriptomes of multiple edited models pointed to Gli3 and the Hedgehog signaling pathway in a genotype-specific manner, while SPOP mutation and AR stimulation promote Gli3 accumulation in the full-length (FL) transcriptionally active form. This, in turn, triggers the cell-autonomous production of steroids that prostate cancer relies on, in line with the enhanced responsiveness of SPOP-mutated prostate cancer to androgen deprivation therapy. These data demonstrate that germline variants dictate men's prostate cancer somatic evolution and suggest opportunities to jointly model germline-somatic tandems to help untangle the complexity of human cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutations are somatic variants in lung adenocarcinoma. One of the most prevalent mutations, G12C, has led to the clinical approval of targeted inhibitors for advanced stages in lung cancer. Research has increasingly focused on the efficacy of combination therapies that target multiple tumorigenic pathways. Cases harboring KRAS G12C mutation are heterogenous. We explored alternative changes in genetic pathways and evaluated the effectiveness of combination therapy using several types of cell lines and KRAS inhibitors. Methods We comprehensively investigated genetic changes induced by KRAS G12C inhibition using RNA sequences and the candidate to inhibit in combination therapy was explored. Three lung cancer cell lines (two adenocarcinoma and one squamous cell carcinoma) and three KRAS G12C inhibitors (AMG 510, MRTX849, and ARS-1620) were used. KRAS G12C and candidate gene were simultaneously inhibited in cell lines and the efficiency of combination therapy was evaluated using clonogenic assays and MTS assay. Pathway activation was assessed via western blotting. A combination index (CI) < 0.8 was considered statistically synergistic. Results RNA sequences revealed treatment with two of the three KRAS G12C inhibitors led to a significant increase in mTOR expression across all three cell lines. mTOR was targeted in combination therapy; each KRAS G12C inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor (RAD001) combination exhibited synergism (CI < 0.8) in MTS and clonogenic assays. Single inhibition of mTOR induced activation of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-RAS, thereby activating the RAS-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways in WB, suggesting mTOR activation is crucial for KRAS-driving lung cancer. A combination strategy targeting KRAS G12C and mTOR abrogated GTP-RAS, pmTOR (Ser2448), and pERK (Thr202/Tyr204) more efficiently. Conclusions KRAS G12C inhibitor plus RAD001 consistently revealed synergism. Targeting KRAS G12C and mTOR abrogates the RAS-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways. Our data suggests that a combined strategy targeting GTP-bound KRAS G12C and mTOR shows promise for primary lung cancers with KRAS G12C mutations. This approach may also be effective even for lung cancers harboring KRAS G12C mutation but having different profiles.

        <tr id="Aim: The current in vitro study investigated the role of Period 2 (PER2) in aggressiveness and the acquisition of drug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Parental PLC/PRF/5 cells, along with everolimus-resistant (EveR) and Sorafenib-resistant (SorR) cell lines, were used in this study. PER2 expression was silenced using siRNA knockdown (KD) and blocked using CRISPR/Cas9 Plasmid knockout (KO). PER2 expression levels were assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence, together with markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, casein kinase 1ε (CK1ε), and tumor protein p53. Modulation of p53, p21, cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene, and mouse double minute 2 homolog was investigated by western blot. Mitochondrial activity was evaluated using the Seahorse System. The role of PER2 on the onset of aggressiveness was examined through assays of cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation. Results: PLC/PRF/5 everolimus-resistant (EveR), SorR, PER2 KD, and PER2 KO cells expressed significantly lower PER2 mRNA and protein levels compared to the parental PLC/PRF/5 cells. Remarkably, in PLC/PRF/5 EveR and SorR cells, PER2 protein was entirely localized in the cytoplasm, where it colocalized with CK1ε, in contrast to the parental cells. In PLC/PRF/5 EveR, PER2 KD and PER2 KO cells, but not in SorR cells, E-cadherin was significantly decreased while vimentin and ZEB1 protein levels were significantly increased across all modified cell models. Interestingly, p53 expression was reduced in PER2 KO cells and completely absent in PLC/PRF/5 EveR and SorR cells. Consistent with these findings, the inhibitory effect of everolimus (10-9 M) and sorafenib (5 × 10-6 M) on cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation observed in parental PLC/PRF/5 cells were reversed in PER2 KD and KO cells, which was accompanied by upregulation of oncogenes, downregulation of tumor suppressor genes, and alterations in mitochondrial activity. Conclusion: These results suggest that the acquisition of an aggressive phenotype is characterized by reduced PER2 expression and loss of its nuclear translocation, which, in turn, is associated with resistance to systemic therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.">

        <tr id="The CRISPR–Cas system has transformed molecular biology by providing precise tools for genome editing and pathogen detection. Originating from bacterial adaptive immunity, CRISPR technology identifies and cleaves genetic material from pathogens, thereby preventing infections. CRISPR–Cas9, the most widely utilized variant, creates double-stranded breaks in the target DNA, enabling genetic disruptions or edits. This approach has shown significant potential in antiviral therapies, addressing chronic infections, such as HIV, SARS-CoV-2, and hepatitis viruses. In HIV, CRISPR–Cas9 edits the essential viral genes and disrupts latent reservoirs, while CCR5 gene modifications render the T cells resistant to viral entry. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 is targeted using CRISPR–Cas13d to inhibit the conserved viral genes, significantly reducing viral loads. Hepatitis B and C treatments leverage CRISPR technologies to target conserved genomic regions, limiting replication and expression. Emerging innovations, such as the PAC-MAN approach for influenza and base-editing systems to reduce off-target effects, further highlight the therapeutic versatility of CRISPR. Additionally, advances in Cas12a and Cas13 have driven the development of diagnostic platforms like DETECTR and SHERLOCK, which provide rapid and cost-effective viral detection. Innovative tools like AIOD-CRISPR enable accessible point-of-care diagnostics for early viral detection. Experimental approaches, such as targeting latent HSV-1 reservoirs, highlight the transformative potential of CRISPR in combating persistent infections.">

        <tr id="T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) exhibits exceptionally high levels of DNA methylation, with silencing of the DNA demethylating enzyme TET2 implicated in T-ALL’s hypermethylation phenotype. We propose that DNA hypomethylating agents (HMAs) could be particularly potent in T-ALL cells with this phenotype. Here, we used a reversible DNMT1-specific inhibitor and the conventional HMAs, 5-azacytidine and decitabine, to assess the effects of global DNA methylation loss in T-ALL cell lines and the potential of using HMAs as targeted therapeutic agents in T-ALL. We demonstrate that removal of DNA methylation, even in the absence of DNA damage, results in cell death and that toxicity is negatively correlated with methylation levels. Notably, whereas DNA demethylation caused limited transcriptional changes, key tumour suppressor genes, including TET2, were upregulated in a methylation-dependent manner. Few endogenous retroviruses or immune-related genes were reactivated after demethylation, challenging the contribution of ‘viral mimicry’ to HMA toxicity. Together, these findings provide fundamental insights into the role of DNA methylation in T-ALL, demonstrating that the removal of DNA methylation alone is sufficient to (i) induce cell death in T-ALL cell lines and (ii) reactivate silenced tumour suppressor genes. Our findings support the development of therapies targeting the unique methylation phenotype of T-ALL.

        <tr id="Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality despite advances in treatments, necessitating more effective therapeutic strategies. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized our ability to dissect the cellular complexity of cancers, which is often obscured in conventional bulk transcriptomic experiments. Methods: In this study, we performed an integrative analysis of scRNA-seq data from multiple LUAD patient cohorts to investigate cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes across disease stages. Clustering, lineage trajectory analysis, and transcriptional regulatory network reconstruction were employed to identify stage-specific gene markers and their upstream regulators. Additionally, we constructed intercellular communication networks to evaluate signaling changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) during LUAD progression. Results: Our analysis revealed that epithelial cells from stage IV tumors exhibited a distinct transcriptional profile compared to earlier stages, a separation not observed in immune or stromal cell populations. We identified a panel of gene markers that differentiated epithelial cells across disease stages and effectively stratified patients into subgroups with distinct survival outcomes and TME compositions. Regulatory network analysis uncovered key transcription factors, including ATF3, ATF4, HSF1, KLF4, and NFIC, as potential upstream regulators of these stage-specific genes. Moreover, cell–cell communication analysis revealed a significant increase in signaling originating from epithelial cells and a concomitant decrease in immune-derived signals in late-stage LUAD. We identified several signaling pathways enriched in stage-specific crosstalk, including Wnt, PTN, and PDGF pathways, which may play critical roles in LUAD progression. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive single-cell resolution map of LUAD progression, highlighting epithelial-driven regulatory programs and dynamic intercellular communication within the TME. Our findings uncover novel molecular markers and regulatory mechanisms with potential prognostic and therapeutic value for more precise treatment.">

        <tr id="The IgLON family of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) impact a variety of cellular processes involved in cancer and non-cancer biology. OPCML is a member of this family and its inactivation is an important control point in oncogenesis and tumor growth. Here, we analyze RNA-Seq expression ratios in ovarian cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (189 subjects at Stage III) to identify genes that exhibit a cooperative survival impact (via Kaplan–Meier survival curves) with OPCML expression. Using enrichment analyses, we reconstruct functional pathway impacts revealing interactions of OPCML, and then validate these in independent cohorts of ovarian cancer. These results emphasize the role of OPCML’s regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways (PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK) while identifying three new potential RTK transcriptomic linkages to KIT, TEK, and ROS1 in ovarian cancer. We show that other known extracellular signaling receptor ligands are also transcriptionally linked to OPCML. Several key genes were validated in GEO datasets, including KIT and TEK. Considering the range of OPCML impacts evident in our analyses on both external membrane interactions and cytosolic signal transduction, we expand the understanding of OPCML’s broad cellular influences, demonstrating a multi-functional, pleiotropic, tumor suppressor, in keeping with prior published studies of OPCML function.">

        <tr id="The ATP-hydrolytic ectoenzyme ENPP1 has been implicated in the metastasis and recurrence in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), primarily by contributing to tumor cell survival and treatment resistance. However, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. In a model of local recurrence (LR), circulating tumor cells (CTC) engrafting in the post-resection tumor bed developed a radioresistant phenotype linked to an ENPP1+-gene signature which was also identified in TNBC patients, suggesting ENPP1´s role in genome integrity. Blockade of ENPP1 using a permeable ENPP1 inhibitor (AVA-NP-695) reduced radioresistance, mechanistically attributed to decreased homologous recombination (HR) resulting in persistent DNA damage, as evidenced by enhanced tail moment and sustained γH2AX formation. This impaired DNA damage repair (DDR) sensitized tumor cells to ionizing radiation (IR). Notably, several DDR inhibitors (i) (including PARPi and ATMi) showed the highest synergy score in a targeted pharmacological screening. In vivo, dual ENPP1/ATM inhibition heightened radiosensitivity, compromised tumor cell survival and enhanced STING-TBK1 signaling by preventing ENPP1-mediated cGAMP hydrolysis. This resulted in robust innate and long-lasting adaptive antitumor immune memory responses, leading to significant tumor regression. Remarkably, combined treatment post-IR reduced spontaneous metastasis and local recurrence, and induced abscopal effects that impacted distant tumor spread in orthotopic tumor models. Thus, these findings position ENPP1 as a critical link between genome integrity and immunosuppression, offering promising translational opportunities for treating local or distant dissemination in TNBC.">

 Background:
 Understanding the molecular profile of cancer-associated genes is crucial in oncology, as it informs targeted therapies and improves patient outcomes. Tumor suppressor genes inhibit the activation of oncogenic signals, while oncogenes promote them. Ras proteins, encoded by KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS genes, are involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival pathways. This study aims to investigate the frequency of KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS mutations in solid tumors treated at a single academic institution between January 2017 and May 2024. By analyzing these mutations, we seek to enhance our understanding of their distribution across different cancer types in Venezuela, providing valuable insights for personalized cancer treatment strategies.
 Methods:
 We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional, analytical cohort study. The study included 175 patients, with 179 molecular genetic sequencing studies and 20 RT-PCR analyses. We examined mutations in codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, and 146 of the KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS genes.
 Results:
 We identified 43 mutations in the RAS gene family: 37 in KRAS, 5 in NRAS, and 1 in HRAS. Lung cancer accounted for 14 of those mutations, with 13 in KRAS and 1 in HRAS. Colorectal cancer showed 19 mutations, with 16 in KRAS and 3 in NRAS. Other KRAS mutations (13.9%) were found in breast, endometrial, pancreatic cancers, and thymoma. We also recorded 2 NRAS mutations in melanoma and 1 in pancreatic cancer.
 Conclusions:
 This study represents the largest collection of KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS mutations reported in Venezuela.

Through a biochemical lens that highlights the molecular complexities behind its methods and discoveries, this review explores the complex field of CRISPR cloning and its emerging frontiers. We examine the molecular underpinnings of target identification, protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) specificity, and Cas nuclease activation, starting with the groundbreaking discovery of CRISPR-Cas systems in bacterial adaptive immunity. Advances in CRISPR-based cloning techniques, such as the creation of synthetic guide RNAs, Cas variants with specific functions, and high-fidelity and base-editing systems that reduce off-target effects, are also examined in the study. The molecular dynamics of DNA-RNA-protein interactions during gene targeting, activation of DNA repair pathways, and epigenetic state regulation are given special attention. We investigate cutting-edge uses beyond traditional genome editing, including RNA-targeting Cas proteins (like Cas13), CRISPR-based diagnostics and treatments, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa). Additionally covered is the incorporation of CRISPR with other biochemical technologies, such as gene drives, programmable transcription factors, and synthetic biology circuits. The field's increasing biochemical sophistication is highlighted by new developments like CRISPR-nanoparticle conjugates for targeted delivery and CRISPR screening platforms for functional genomics.

        <tr id="Rare genetic DNA repair deficiency syndromes can lead to immunodeficiency, neurological disorders, and cancer. In the general population, inter-individual variation in DNA repair capacity (DRC) influences susceptibility to cancer and several age-related diseases. Genome wide association studies and functional analyses show that defects in multiple DNA repair pathways jointly increase disease risk, but previous technologies did not permit comprehensive analyses of DNA repair in populations. To overcome these limitations, we used fluorescence multiplex host cell reactivation (FM-HCR) assays that directly quantify DRC across six major DNA repair pathways. We assessed DRC in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated primary lymphocytes from 56 healthy individuals and validated assay reproducibility in 10 individuals with up to five independent blood draws. We furthermore developed generalized analytical pipelines for systematically adjusting for batch effects and both experimental and biological confounders. Our results reveal significant inter-individual variation in DRC for each of 10 reporter assays that measure the efficiency of distinct repair processes. Our data also demonstrate that correlations between the activities of different DNA repair pathways are relatively weak. This finding suggests that each pathway may independently influence susceptibility to the health effects of DNA damage. We furthermore developed a pipeline for analyzing comet repair kinetics and related our new functional data to previously reported comet assay data for the same individuals. Our pioneering analysis underscores the sensitivity of FM-HCR assays for detecting subtle biological differences between individuals and establishes standardized methodologies for population studies. Our findings and open source analytical tools advance precision medicine by enabling comprehensive exploration of genetic, demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors and supporting targeted interventions to enhance DNA repair and maintain genomic integrity, thereby promoting personalized healthcare and disease prevention.">

Mutational patterns in these tumors appear to be influenced by multiple factors, including the affected MMR gene and tumor type. Somatic polymerase proofreading mutations, commonly present in brain tumors, are also found in a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma displaying associated mutational patterns. We show prominent mutational patterns in two second primary hematological malignancies after temozolomide treatment. Furthermore, an indel signature, characterized by one-base pair cytosine insertions in cytosine homopolymers, is found in 54% of tumors.

        <tr id="Human exonuclease 1 (EXO1), a member of the structure-specific nuclease family, plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability by processing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), nicks, and replication intermediates during DNA replication and repair. As its exonuclease activity is essential for homologous recombination (HR) and replication fork processing, EXO1 has emerged as a compelling therapeutic target, especially in cancers marked by heightened DNA damage and replication stress. Through high-throughput screening of 45,000 compounds, we identified seven distinct chemical scaffolds that demonstrated effective and selective inhibition of EXO1. Representative compounds from two of the most potent scaffolds, C200 and F684, underwent a comprehensive docking analysis and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis studies to evaluate their binding mechanisms. Biochemical assays further validated their potent and selective inhibition of the EXO1 nuclease activity. Tumor cell profiling experiments revealed that these inhibitors exploit synthetic lethality in BRCA1-deficient cells, emphasizing their specificity and therapeutic potential for targeting genetically HR-deficient (HRD) cancers driven by deleterious mutations in HR genes like BRCA1/2. Mechanistically, EXO1 inhibition suppressed DNA end resection, stimulated the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks, and triggered S-phase PARylation, effectively disrupting DNA repair pathways that are essential for cancer cell survival. These findings establish EXO1 inhibitors as promising candidates for the treatment of HRD cancers and lay the groundwork for the further optimization and development of these compounds as targeted therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Heterogeneity in cancer gene expression is typically linked to genetic and epigenetic alterations, yet post-transcriptional regulation likely influences these patterns as well. However, the quantitative contribution of post-transcriptional mechanisms to cancer transcriptome dynamics remains unclear. Here, we systematically measured mRNA dynamics across diverse breast cancer models, revealing that mRNA stability significantly shapes gene expression variability. To decipher the regulatory grammar underlying these dynamics, we developed GreyHound, an interpretable multimodal deep-learning framework integrating RNA sequence features and RNA-binding protein (RBP) expression. GreyHound identified an extensive network of RBPs and their regulons underlying variations in mRNA stability. Among these, we uncovered a metastasis-suppressive regulatory axis centered on the RNA-binding protein RBMS3 and its post-transcriptional control of the redox regulator TXNIP. Functional and molecular analyses revealed that RBMS3 depletion resulted in targeted transcript destabilization, which was associated with poor clinical outcomes and enhanced metastatic potential in xenograft models. Using in vivo epistasis studies, we confirmed that RBMS3 regulation of TXNIP mRNA stability drives this metastasis-suppressive program. These findings position the RBMS3-TXNIP regulatory axis as a key post-transcriptional mechanism in breast cancer and illustrate how interpretable models of RNA dynamics can uncover hidden regulatory programs in disease.">

        <tr id="Genome maintenance is of the utmost importance in stem cells, as mutations can be propagated and cause defects in derivative tissues. Many stem cell types display low mutation rates, with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) being a notable example. The bases for this property are unclear but may be achieved by optimization of various processes including high-fidelity DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint controls, and hypersensitivity to genotoxic insults that trigger cell death. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the unique responses of mouse ESCs (mESCs) to replication stress (RS) using an array of small molecule inhibitors and genotoxins. We find that whereas mESCs survive under acute RS in an ATR- and CHK1-dependent manner similar to somatic cells, they lack a strong G2/M checkpoint and fail to repair DNA crosslinks in the absence of ATR signaling. Despite the lack of a strong G2/M checkpoint, mESCs maintain a spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). We posit that mESCs preferentially repair DNA crosslinks in S phase via homology-directed mechanisms, and cells that fail to complete repair before mitosis undergo mitotic catastrophe and cell death. These findings shed light on mutation avoidance mechanisms in ESCs that may extend to other stem cell types.">

We developed knock-in mouse models representing distinct classes of FOXA1 mutations. Histopathological and multi-omic analyses of prostate tissues and organoids revealed that Class 1 mutations, in conjunction with p53 inactivation, drive androgen-dependent adenocarcinomas through co-activation of mTORC1/2 and oncogenic AR signaling stemming from chimeric AR-half enhancers. In contrast, Class 2 mutations induce intra-luminal plasticity by reprogramming differentiated luminal cells into a progenitor-like state through activation of KLF5 and AP-1 neo-enhancer circuitries, which enables enhanced survival and proliferation even under castrate androgen levels. Our findings establish FOXA1 as a multifaceted oncogene, with distinct mutational classes divergently evolving to drive prostate tumorigenesis or therapy-resistant progression.">

        <tr id="Background The three-prime repair exonuclease 1, TREX1, degrades cytosolic DNA to prevent aberrant immune activation. Its inactivation results in DNA accumulation in the cytosol and induction of the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway, interferon signaling, and inflammation. Germline pathogenic TREX1 mutations are known to lead to hereditary autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, whereas the consequences of TREX1 mutations in cancer remain poorly understood. Results To assess the importance of human TREX1 amino acid variants, we analyzed protein sequences of the functional TREX1b isoform from 168 mammalian species and integrated available data on TREX1 sequence and copy number alterations in hereditary autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, cancer, and in human populations. While the entire TREX1b protein was conserved in placental mammals, egg-laying mammals and marsupials had their own unique C-terminal regions, with each predicted to contain a transmembrane domain. We modeled human TREX1 variants occurring in autoimmune disease and cancer samples at 12 protein positions to evaluate their predicted impact on protein stability and function. Conclusions Our findings provide novel insight into the role of TREX1 molecular variation in cancer, where genetic or epigenetic loss of TREX1 activity may improve susceptibility to treatment. However, TREX1 gene deletion in tumors was associated with unfavorable patient outcomes, most likely due its frequent co-occurrence with the loss of the entire 3p chromosomal arm, which contains known cancer-related genes.

        <tr id="XPO1 is a nuclear export receptor that is essential for cell survival. Previous genomic analyses have identified recurrent XPO1 hotspot mutations in cancer. Here, we conducted a large-scale genomic analysis of 217,570 cancer patients to identify and characterize XPO1 variants from real-world patient tumors. XPO1 harbored a R749Q mutation in various solid tumors, with a clear enrichment in endometrial and colorectal cancers, and XPO1R749Q mutations significantly co-occurred with POLE mutations. Analysis of isogenic colon cancer cell lines revealed that XPO1R749Q localized more in the cytoplasm than wildtype XPO1, with enhanced export of a large number of proteins. Structural modeling of XPO1R749Q suggested an increase in RanGTP affinity, which is consistent with enhanced protein export. A compound library screen using over 200 FDA-approved anticancer drugs indicated a general trend towards chemoresistance, specifically to topoisomerase I inhibition, in XPO1R749Q mutant cells. Mechanistically, XPO1R749Q mutant cells exhibited enhanced DNA damage response via RPA phosphorylation in response to topoisomerase I inhibition. Combining XPO1 and topoisomerase I inhibitors reduced DNA damage-induced RPA phosphorylation and mediated synergistic antitumor effects in cells harboring the XPO1R749Q mutation. Finally, the combination of selinexor and irinotecan overcame chemotherapeutic resistance in xenograft mouse models, prolonging survival. These findings suggest that XPO1 alterations in cancer are selected for in POLE mutant tumors and may confer resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapies, which have implications for patients with tumors bearing XPO1R749Q and for XPO1 inhibitor development in cancer.">

        <tr id="This study analyzed the genetics of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) by using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Two genetic subtypes were identified, differing in genetic instability mechanisms: one subtype (64% of cases) showed a higher mutation load and a higher fraction of mutations associated with activation-induced cytidine deaminase and microsatellite instability signatures, while the other subtype (36% of cases) exhibited chromosomal instability with more somatic copy number alterations. Whole-genome duplication was more common in cHL compared to other B-cell tumors and emerged as a prognostic biomarker for patients undergoing ABVD-based therapy. Non-coding regulatory mutations, similar to those in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, were highly prevalent in 86% of cHL. A recurrent somatic expression quantitative trait locus (seQTL) involving the BCL6 gene was found in 30% of cases. The seQTL of BCL6 aligned with accessible chromatin and increased H3K27 acetylation in cHL, disrupted PRDM1 binding, and co-occurred with BCL6 expression in cHL cells. Weak to strong expression of BCL6 was observed in 68% of cases and BCL6 expression associated with gene repression similarly in cHL and germinal center B cells. After BCL6 degradation, the core set of genes directly bound and regulated by BCL6 was derepressed in cHL and proliferation was impaired. The number and clonality of neoantigens was associated with tumor microenvironment type and response to checkpoint blockade. Finally, ctDNA analysis was suggested as a tool to distinguish ambiguous PET/CT-positive lesions post-treatment.">

        <tr id="Cancer genomics has advanced a lot; a main problem is still turning molecular findings into treatments due to the variety of cells in each tumor and gaps in knowing certain pathway functions. Predicting whether a treatment will be effective is difficult right now which means that patient outcomes are often less than ideal. This research tackled the issue by studying whether looking at many genes and oncogenic pathways at the same time helps identify which patients may show cancer progression or treatment resistance. For this study, we looked at the genes, proteins and other molecules from a total of 1,500 patients in six major types of cancer (breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, ovarian and prostate). We used genomic variant calling, analysis of gene pathways and detailed study of proteins with advanced bioinformatics and machine learning tools. The study found that TP53 mutations (OR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.72-2.66, p < 0.001) and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway being activated (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.51-2.37, p = 0.003) were strongly linked to cancer not responding to treatment and negative outcomes. Tumors with a high number of mutations (≥ 10/Mb) reacted much better to immunotherapy (OR: 3.02, p < 0.001). Three subgroups of tumors were found through unsupervised analysis and these showed different chances of success: tumors with many mutations and high immune activity performed best (39.1% complete response), but those with mutations in PI3K and TP53 had the worst prognosis (28.5% progressive disease). Patients whose tumors were active in the PI3K/AKT pathway had progression-free survival of 8.2 months, significantly less (log-rank p < 0.001) than those whose tumors were not active. Evidence shows that integrative molecular profiling is better at predicting outcomes than the traditional method of classifying tumors by looking at slides. Study results show which molecular subgroups are most important to oncology and help link their treatment response to which therapy is best,">

        <tr id="Intratumor heterogeneity arises from ongoing somatic evolution complicating cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Here we present TEATIME (estimating evolutionary events through single-timepoint sequencing), a novel computational framework that models tumors as mixtures of two competing cell populations: an ancestral clone with baseline fitness and a derived subclone with elevated fitness. Using cross-sectional bulk sequencing data, TEATIME estimates mutation rates, timing of subclone emergence, relative fitness, and number of generations of growth. To quantify intratumor fitness asymmetries, we introduce a novel metric—fitness diversity—which captures the imbalance between competing cell populations and serves as a measure of functional intratumor heterogeneity. Applying TEATIME to 33 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we revealed divergent as well as convergent evolutionary patterns. Notably, we found that immune-hot microenvironments constraint subclonal expansion and limit fitness diversity. Moreover, we detected temporal dependencies in mutation acquisition, where early driver mutations in ancestral clones epistatically shape the fitness landscape, predisposing specific subclones to selective advantages. These findings underscore the importance of intratumor competition and tumor-microenvironment interactions in shaping evolutionary trajectories, driving intratumor heterogeneity. Lastly, we demonstrate that TEATIME-derived evolutionary parameters and fitness diversity offer novel prognostic insights across multiple cancer types.">

        <tr id="Tumor-derived biomarkers can precisely reflect cell types, offering major potential for early detection and therapy. An engineered platform capable of distinguishing various biomarkers for cancer type identification and autonomous responsive therapeutics is urgently needed. Herein, a "one stop" production line with logic gated composite for tumor cell identification, related biomarker imaging, and subsequent gene therapy is proposed. The designed composite can specifically target cancer cells through incorporated aptamers, which endows it with identification preference for cancer cells with overexpressed membrane protein receptors. Internalized materials collapse in the acidic lysosome milieu, releasing the functioning DNA strands. Endogenous miR-210 then can initiate cascade reactions with released strands, resulting in the liberation of therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides (ASO). The strategy is to construct a platform for cancer therapy based on second-order AND Boolean logic operation for multiple cancer biomarkers (Mucin 1 (MUC1), Protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), and miR-210) identification and succeeding therapy toward identified cells. Through the logic operation, produced fluorescent signals can disclose the types of biomarkers being recognized, while nano-material endocytosis, subsequent miRNA imaging, and endogenous miRNA-triggered gene therapy can all be performed concurrently. This "one stop" multifunctional production line demonstrates excellent sensitivity and accuracy, and presents promising prospects in the early diagnosis of tumors and precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Chromosomal 11q13.3 amplification is the most common gene copy-number variation event in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) that corresponds with poor prognosis. Although cyclin D1, a G1/S phase cell-cycle regulatory protein at this locus, is considered as a key driver of malignant progression, further exploration is needed to develop more effective targets for cases with this amplification. Using CRISPR-based gene knockout screening of genes located in chr11q13.3, we found that loss of the gene encoding the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein, a well-recognized adapter to caspase-8 that induces cell apoptosis, significantly reduced cancer cell proliferation. FADD expression was elevated in chr11q13.3-amplified tumors and correlated with poor prognosis. RNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, and proteomics analyses revealed a direct relationship between FADD and the DNA helicase MCM5 in the S phase. FADD and cyclin D1 acted at different stages of the cell cycle to synergistically induce proliferation, and caspase-8 deficiency was required for the oncogenic activity of FADD. In a patient-derived xenograft model with chr11q13.3 amplification, combined administration of the DNA helicase complex inhibitor and CDK4/6 inhibitor effectively curtailed tumor growth. Overall, this study identified a nonclassic oncogenic role for FADD in mediating tumor progression in HNSCC and provided a feasible treatment option for patients with chr11q13.3 amplification. Significance: FADD promotes progression of tumors with chr11q13.3 amplification by binding to the DNA helicase complex, which can be targeted in combination with cyclin D1 as a viable therapeutic strategy for HNSCC patients.">

Hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) production remains inefficient, precluded by knowledge gaps related to specification and morphogenesis of specialized hemogenic endothelial cells, which undergo an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) to form HPCs. We elected to define changes in gene expression and chromatin organization during HPC formation to reveal regulatory mechanisms. Using paired single cell RNA/ATAC sequencing together with Hi-C, we profiled cells before and after EHT. Pathway analysis and pseudotime inferences confirmed a continuum of stromal and endothelial cells undergoing development into HE cells and lineage-based HPCs in vitro. In these cell types, we characterize cis-regulatory elements and transcriptional regulatory activities that facilitate EHT and HPC homeostasis, including for SNAI1, SOX17, TGFβ, STAT4, as well as for GFI1b and KLF1 in megakaryocyte- and erythroid-biased progenitors, respectively. We then leveraged our insights into chromatin organization among in vitro-derived cells to assess enrichments corresponding to human trait variation reported in human genome wide association studies. HPCs revealed locus enrichment for quantitative blood traits and autoimmune disease predisposition, which were particularly enriched in myeloid- and lymphoid-biased populations. Stromal and endothelial cells from our in vitro cultures were specifically enriched for accessible chromatin at blood pressure loci.

        <tr id="Bladder cancer affects over half a million people worldwide each year. Recent advances in early detection allowed a successful management of non-aggressive cancers, yet the recurrence rate remains high. Aggressive muscle-invasive bladder tumours are life-threatening and challenging to cure. Therefore, understanding of key molecular pathways involved in cancer progression is critical for developing of new personalised targeted therapies. Recently, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators orchestrating complex biological processes in cancer, yet their function is not fully understood. Here, we compare non-muscle invasive and muscle invasive cell lines and identify a ncRNA gene MIR205HG and its transcript LEADR among the top ncRNAs downregulated in muscle invasive urothelial tumours. We show that LEADR expression is epigenetically regulated by master transcription factor p63. LEADR is localised in the nuclei of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer cells where it dampens hyperactivation of interferon stimulated genes possibly increasing sensitivity of bladder cancer cells to interferon signalling. These findings uncover an anti-tumoral role of non-coding RNA LEADR in mediating immune response in bladder cancer.">

How these mutations result in increased risk for numerous age-related diseases remains poorly understood. We conduct a multiracial meta-analysis of EWAS of CHIP in the Framingham Heart Study, Jackson Heart Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohorts (N = 8196) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CHIP and illuminate how these changes influence cardiovascular disease risk. We functionally validate the EWAS findings using human hematopoietic stem cell models of CHIP.

 Background: Hormone Receptor Positive (HR+) breast cancer is predominantly managed with endocrine therapies that target the Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα), a key mediator of estrogen's role in promoting tumor growth. However, the emergence of endocrine resistance poses a significant clinical challenge, limiting the efficacy of these treatments and impeding optimal patient outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms behind ERα's importance and the development of resistance is crucial for advancing therapeutic strategies against HR+ breast cancer. Methods: In our study, we utilized the GEO database to identify ADP-Ribosylation Factor-Like GTPase 3 (ARL3) as a gene associated with tamoxifen resistance in HR+ breast cancer. We constructed cell lines with ARL3 knockout and overexpression to assess the impact of ARL3 on cell proliferation, migration, and tamoxifen sensitivity. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) were employed to demonstrate the influence of ARL3 knockout on downstream ERα pathways. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP), immunofluorescence and Western blot (WB) assays confirmed the role of ARL3 in the ubiquitination and degradation pathway of ERα. Results: In our analysis of TCGA breast cancer subtypes, we also observed that ARL3 is highly expressed in luminal breast cancer. Additionally, our collection of breast cancer tissue mRNA and immunohistochemistry data revealed that ARL3 expression is elevated in HR+ breast cancer, indicating a correlation with estrogen receptors. We found that ARL3 promotes the proliferation and migration of HR+ breast cancer. Furthermore, overexpression of ARL3 was associated with reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen, and in vivo tumorigenesis in nude mice showed that tumor volume and weight were significantly decreased compared to the control group. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, RNA-seq analysis of ARL3 knockout and control groups revealed a pronounced inhibition of the MYC pathway. Western blot (WB) validation confirmed that ARL3 knockout suppresses the expression of downstream pathways of ERα. Our data suggest that the association between ARL3 and ERα primarily occurs in the cytoplasm, mainly binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ERα, which is consistent with ARL3 not being recruited to the promoters occupied by ERα. We also discovered that the ARL3/ERα cascade promotes mitochondrial autophagy to enhance mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In summary, our study establishes a non-genomic mechanism whereby ARL3 controls the transcription of estrogen-dependent genes associated with breast cancer cell proliferation by stabilizing ERα levels. Conclusion: In our study, we posit that ADP-ribosylation factor-like GTPase 3 (ARL3) exerts a pivotal influence on the proliferative capacity, metastatic potential, and responsiveness to endocrine therapies in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. ARL3 modulates the stability of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), thereby regulating the activation of downstream signaling cascades and the mitochondrial functionality within neoplastic cells. Our findings suggest that ARL3 represents a promising therapeutic target for HR+ breast cancer. We envision that in-depth investigation into the molecular underpinnings of ARL3's role could pave the way for the development of innovative pharmacological agents capable of overcoming endocrine resistance in patients, ultimately enhancing their clinical outcomes and survival rates.

        <tr id="Background Resveratrol (RSV) is one of the most studied and used biomolecules, for which many pharmacological effects targeting multiple tissues have been described. However, a common underlying mechanism driving its full pharmacological activity has not been described in detail. G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical nucleic acid structures found in regulatory genomic locations and involved in controlling gene transcription, telomere maintenance, or genome stability, among others. This study provides a genome-wide characterization of RSV G4-binding properties, explaining its multi-target traits. Methods Immunofluorescence assays using a nucleolar and a G4-specific antibody were used to characterize RSV cellular effects on the nucleolus and G4 stabilization. DNA damage and cell cycle analyses were performed via western blot and flow cytometry. Breaks lLbeling In Situ and Sequencing (BLISS) was used to map double strand breaks (DSB) in response to treatment, and identify G4s targeted by RSV. mRNA sequencing was used to identify changes at the transcriptional level upon treatment and relate them to a direct targeting of G4s. Biophysical assays (circular dichroism, ultraviolet–visible [UV–Vis] titration, differential scanning calorimetry, and nuclear magnetic resonance) were used to characterize RSV–G4 interactions. Lastly, luciferase-based transcription assays were performed to confirm RSV–G4 interaction in vitro and its direct influence on gene expression. Results In a cellular context, RSV treatment showed classic G4-ligand effects, such as nucleolar disassembly, inhibition of RNA polymerase I, DNA damage, and cell cycle arrest. RSV was shown to stabilize cellular G4s, which accumulated around double strand breaks in the promoters of differentially expressed genes. Upon treatment, G4 stabilization triggered DNA damage and controlled gene expression. The interaction between RSV and target G4s was confirmed in vitro by biophysical assays and through luciferase-based transcription assays. Conclusions A G4-dependent mode of action was demonstrated as the main mechanism underlying RSV pleiotropic effects, along with the identification of target genes and G4s. This in-depth analysis of the mode of action of RSV will be helpful to improve its therapeutic potential in a wide variety of health scenarios.

        <tr id="Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) are aggressive central nervous system tumors mainly affecting young children. Extensive molecular characterization based on gene expression and DNA methylation patterns has solidly established three major ATRT subtypes (MYC, SHH and TYR), which show distinct clinical features, setting the basis for more effective, targeted treatment regimens. Transcriptional activity of transposable elements (TEs), like LINE1s and LTRs, is tightly linked with human cancers as a direct consequence of lifting epigenetic repression over TEs. The sole recurrent biallelic loss-of-function mutation in SMARCB1 in ATRTs, a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, raises the question of how TE transcription contributes to ATRT development. Here, we comprehensively investigate the transcriptional profiles of 1.9M LINE1 and LTR elements across ATRT subtypes in primary human samples. We find TE transcription profiles are unique, allowing sample stratification into ATRT subtypes. The TE activity signature in ATRT-MYC subtype is unique, setting these tumors apart from SHH and TYR ATRTs. More specifically, ATRT-MYC shows broadly reduced transcript levels of LINE1 and ERVL-MaLR subfamilies. ATRT-MYC is also unique in having significantly less LTR and LINE1 loci with bidirectional promoter activity. Furthermore, we identify 849 differentially transcribed TEs in primary samples, which are predictive towards established ATRT-SHH and-MYC cell line models. In summary, including TE transcription profiles into the molecular characterization of ATRTs might reveal new tumor vulnerabilities leading to novel therapeutic interventions, such as immunotherapy.">

This study identifies single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cellular response to cyclophosphamide (CTX) using phosphoramide mustard (PM), its primary cytotoxic metabolite, and explores the downstream consequences for breast cancer (BC) patients.


METHODS
We analyzed 1,978,545 SNPs from EBV-transformed lymphoblastic cell lines (LCLs) derived from 53 unrelated European individuals, in a genome-wide association study using cellular PM sensitivity data. We filtered SNPs associated with PM sensitivity (p < 5 × 10-5) predicted to overlap with regulatory elements in breast tissue using a chromatin state prediction model. We then assessed the consequences using LCL transcriptomic data and data from BC patients treated with (ACT-BC; N = 155) and without CTX.


RESULTS
Twenty SNPs were filtered out including rs12408401, which was associated with PM resistance (p = 3.89 × 10-5), potentially disrupted a CTCF-loop, and was associated with increased RFX5 expression (p = 0.036), which was associated with poor disease-free interval in ACT-BC patients (HR = 5.32; p = 0.028); and rs784562, which was associated with improved PM sensitivity (p = 6.41 × 10-6), potentially altered nearby enhancer functionality, and reduced expression of KRT72 which was associated with poor progression-free survival in ACT-BC patients (HR = 3.61; p = 0.040).


CONCLUSION
Our study identifies SNPs significantly associated with cellular CTX response with potential mechanistic and clinical relevance, thereby providing insights toward optimized CTX treatment strategies.">

 Background:
 According to the recent 2022-2024 published data from the GLOBOCAN, India alone contributed 15.5% of these cases with a staggering 26% of Breast carcinoma (BC) cases and 0.85 million people succumbed to the disease. Inherited or spontaneous mutations in HRR group of genes can disrupt DNA damage response signaling, impairing HRR and sensitizing cells to genotoxic insults. The current study brings to fore the spectrum of clinically significant and novel HRR pathway gene alterations in breast carcinoma patients with increased TNBC incidence.
 Methods:
 A total of 301, histologically diagnosed breast carcinoma patients were included for germline molecular assessment of HRR pathway genes via Ion Torrent NGS following manufacturer’s protocol from January,2019 to December,2023. Clinical summary and an informed consent were obtained individually from the patients.
 Results:
 Out of the total of 301 BC patients participated in the study, 119(39.53%) were diagnosed TNBC cases. NGS data revealed 76(25.2%) patients to harbour at least one clinically significant HRR pathway gene variant. Predominantly, BRCA2 was the most mutated gene (47.3%), followed by BRCA1 (43.4%) across patients. 41(34.4%) TNBC cases were detected with a pathogenic gene variant. In the mutation spectrum, exon-10 (27.9%) of BRCA1 and exon-11 (52.7%) of BRCA2 genes were the most mutated regions detected. Additionally, findings revealed 11 novel variants across HRR genes. Six novel variants in BRCA1 (exon-10,
 c.1039_1040insA,
 c.2841delA; exon-16, c
 .5009delG
 (02) and, exon-23,
 C.5519_5573del
 ) (02), four in BRCA2 (exon-10,
 c.1249_1250insT
 ; exon-11,
 c.4287_4288insT
 ; exon-14, c
 .7279_7280insC
 and exon-24,
 c.9241_9242insA
 ) and one in FANCD2 (exon-21, c.1900G>A) genes respectively. Also, BRCA1 founder mutation (185delAG) was also observed in two (2.6%) patients. CHEK2, PIK3CA, FANCD2 and TP53 were the other HRR pathway genes found positive in the cohort.
 Conclusions:
 Examining the complete BRCA gene status in patient cohort has enabled the identification of not only recurring pathogenic variants but also novel mutations. Among BC patients, an elevated frequency of TNBC patients (39.53%) is an alarming finding compared to the global incidence of 15-20%. The findings enable promising targeted therapeutic approaches by matching patients to treatments which is most likely to benefit them. With the views over the years and with the projected trends in the coming years, BC is set to remain in the driving seat, to drive the national and global cancer burden. Hence, population-based screening, population based molecular-genetic study updates and novel approaches in different strata of the disease are needed with the fast-moving cancer trend in the global society.

 Background:
 Homozygous deletion of the MTAP occurs in 10-15% of all human cancers. MTAP catalyzes the conversion of MTA (S-adenosylmethionine) into methionine, playing a role in cellular energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Currently, numerous PRMT5 inhibitor drugs are being developed. Accurately detecting the status of MTAP is particularly important. Until recently, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) served as the gold standard for detection of 9p21 loss. However, there is an increasing demand for NGS-based of MTAP deletion detection due to its ease of application and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, we have developed a panel-based detection method that can accurately determine deletion status of MTAP.
 Methods:
 In this study, we utilized a NGS panel that covers more than 2000 SNP loci within the genome. The sequencing depth was greater than 500X. To obtain the absolute copy number of the tumor, an algorithm was employed to correct the log2Ratio for each bin by utilizing the offset between tumor purity and log2Ratio. To validate the accuracy of this method, clinical samples from 41 cases were selected for simultaneous FISH testing and the NGS panel detection mentioned above. An additional 1260 clinical samples were selected for NGS testing to confirm the incidence of all exon deletions and partial loss.
 Results:
 All samples were successfully detected. Among 41 cases, FISH and NGS accurately identified 28 homozygous deletions and 11 heterozygous deletions; 2 samples incorrectly identified. The overall consistency in status determination reached 95% (39/41). Using the above algorithm to evaluation additional samples, 17% of the deletions can be accurately identified, including 60.7% of homozygous deletion. The detection rates of MTAP homozygous deletion in different cancer types are similar to the TCGA data. Specifically, it was observed that non-small cell lung cancer had a frequency of 16.7%, head and neck cancer of 17.3%, urothelial carcinoma of 40.4%, colorectal of 3.0%, pancreatic of 18.0%, glioma of 21.0%, and esophageal of 19.5%. The algorithm can accurately categorize all identified deletions into two groups: 13.8% complete gene deletions and 3.2% partial exon deletions. The multiple exon loss frequcies inclued exon 5-8 loss in 2.8% , exon 6-8 loss in 1.4%, exon 7-8 loss in 4.7% , exon 8 loss in 7.5% and other less common multi-exon losses.
 Conclusions:
 The NGS-based method established in this study for detecting MTAP deletion demonstrates a high consistency of 95% with FISH. Furthermore, it shows superior performance to FISH in detecting partial exon loss. This research method holds potential for application in companion diagnostics for drug therapy.

        <tr id="Kinases are pivotal in regulating signaling pathways, and their dysregulation is associated with various diseases, including cancers, making them prime therapeutic targets. Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) is crucial for B-cell development, and BTK inhibitors have proven effective in treating B-cell malignancies like Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Non-covalent inhibitors offer a promising therapeutic approach by avoiding covalent bond formation with the protein. However, therapeutic resistance due to BTK mutations in the catalytic domain has led to relapses and refractory cases in CLL, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of these mutations' impact on treatment outcomes. This study investigates the effects of four prevalent single-point mutations-A428D, T474I, C481S, and L528W-within the catalytic domain of BTK. Using 12.5 microseconds of molecular dynamics simulations and computational drug discovery methods, we examine how these mutations influence the binding affinities and interactions of non-covalent BTK inhibitors. Molecular Mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) analysis showed that mutant forms of BTK significantly decreased ligand binding free energies compared to the wild types, with a few exceptions. With pocket volume and solvent-accessible surface area analysis, we also show that mutations reduce the binding pocket volume, forcing the inhibitors to move out of the pocket, disrupting the critical non-covalent interactions of the inhibitors with mutant BTK. This confirms the experimental and clinical observations of why these BTK mutations impair inhibitor efficacy fostering drug resistance. Our results offer vital insights for designing next-generation BTK inhibitors to overcome resistance and enhance therapeutic outcomes in B-cell malignancies.">

        <tr id="DNA methylation is the best-known epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Its counterpart, known as DNA demethylation, is equally important and enables the activation of previously silenced genes. DNA demethylation has attracted interest in the scientific community following the landmark discovery that Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) proteins can convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. A growing body of research indicates that changes in TET protein levels and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine content are hallmarks of cancer. These epigenetic changes appear to play a critical role in the development of malignancies characterized by high levels of somatic mutations and genetic instability. Bladder cancer is among the most common cancers worldwide and, despite aggressive treatment, remains associated with high mortality and poor prognosis. The lack of reliable diagnostic and prognostic markers poses a significant challenge in its management, highlighting the urgent need for novel biomarkers to enable earlier diagnosis and more accurate prediction of clinical outcomes. This review examines epigenetic alterations associated with bladder cancer and their clinical implications. We focus on the impact of DNA methylation and demethylation on oncogene regulation, summarize scientific evidence supporting their role in bladder cancer development and progression, and briefly explore novel therapeutic strategies targeting those epigenetic mechanisms.">

        <tr id="The problem of interpretation of the genetic data from patients with inherited cardiovascular diseases still remains relevant. To date, the clinical significance of approximately 40 % of variants in genes associated with inherited cardiovascular diseases is uncertain, which requires new approaches to the assessment of their pathogenetic contribution. A combination of the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and editing the iPSC genome with CRISPR/Cas9 is thought to be the most promising tool for clarifying variant pathogenicity. A variant of unknown significance in MYH7, p.Met659Ile (c.1977G>A), was previously identified in several genetic screenings of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients. In this study, the single nucleotide substitution was corrected with CRISPR/Cas9 in iPSCs generated from a carrier of the variant. As a result, two iPSC lines (ICGi019-B-1 and ICGi019-B-2) were generated and characterized using a standard set of methods. The iPSC lines with the corrected p.Met659Ile (c.1977G>A) variant in MYH7 possessed a morphology characteristic of human pluripotent cells, expressed markers of the pluripotent state (the OCT4, SOX2, NANOG transcription factors and SSEA-4 surface antigen), were able to give rise to derivatives of three germ layers during spontaneous differentiation, and retained a normal karyotype (46,XY). No CRISPR/Cas9 off-target activity was found in the ICGi019-B-1 and ICGi019-B-2 iPSC lines. The maintenance of the pluripotent state and normal karyotype and the absence of CRISPR/Cas9 off-target activity in the iPSC lines with the corrected p.Met659Ile (c.1977G>A) variant in MYH7 allow using the iPSC lines as an isogenic control for further studies of the variant pathogenicity and its impact on the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy development.">

        <tr id="DNA methylation is a primary layer of epigenetic modification that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of development, aging, and cancer. The concurrent activity of opposing enzymes that mediate DNA methylation and demethylation gives rise to a biochemical cycle and active turnover of DNA methylation. While the ensuing biochemical oscillations have been implicated in the regulation of cell differentiation, their functional role and spatio-temporal dynamics are, however, unknown. In this work, we demonstrate that chromatin-mediated coupling between these local biochemical cycles can lead to the emergence of phase-locked domains, regions of locally synchronized turnover activity, whose coarsening is arrested by genomic heterogeneity. We introduce a minimal model based on stochastic oscillators with constrained long-range and non-reciprocal interactions, shaped by the local chromatin organization. Through a combination of analytical theory and stochastic simulations, we predict both the degree of synchronization and the typical size of emergent phase-locked domains. We qualitatively test these predictions using single-cell sequencing data. Our results show that DNA methylation turnover exhibits surprisingly rich spatio-temporal patterns which may be used by cells to control cell differentiation.">

        <tr id="MYC is an aberrantly regulated transcription factor implicated in approximately 70% of human tumors, where it extensively modulates signaling pathways associated with cancer progression. Inactivating MYC has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and even induce sustained tumor regression across various cancer types, a phenomenon referred to as oncogene addiction. However, in vitro studies reveal that the knockout or knockdown of MYC in numerous tumor cell lines does not necessarily result in cell death, despite these tumors exhibiting MYC addiction in vivo. This discrepancy suggests that the unique tumor microenvironment in vivo may play a critical role in facilitating MYC addiction in cancer cells. MYC is also widely acknowledged for its role in mediating the immune evasion of tumor cells. Nevertheless, due to the extensive regulation of cellular gene expression by MYC and the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumor immune escape, the precise pathways through which MYC influences tumor immune evasion remain inadequately elucidated. Recent years have seen the identification of novel tumor immune escape mechanisms, some of which have been demonstrated to be directly or indirectly regulated by MYC. For instance, MYC may contribute to immune evasion by modulating the expression of argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1), a key enzyme involved in arginine biosynthesis. Herein, in this study, we explore some novel potential mechanisms through which MYC facilitates the immune evasion of tumor cells, alongside a combined therapeutic approach targeting MYC and employing immunotherapy based on this mechanism. Furthermore, we suggest that targeting proteins interacting with MYC to modulate its expression and function may serve as an alternative strategy to direct MYC targeting, thereby expediting the clinical translation of combination therapies.">

 Background:
 NPM1
 GA characterize a clinically important subset of AML cases which relapse in more than 50% of treated patients despite being generally sensitive to conventional chemotherapy regimens. In AML, the interactions between GA in
 NPM1
 ,
 KMT2A
 and menin protein have been linked to leukemogenesis and represent new potential targets for anti-tumor therapies.
 Methods:
 4,206 cases of AML underwent comprehensive genomic profiling from 2019 through 2024, using the FoundationOne Heme combined hybrid capture based DNA and RNA sequencing assay. All classes of relevant GA were evaluated. The tumor mutation burden (TMB), homologous recombination deficiency signature (HRDsig) and microsatellite Stability (MSS) status were determined from the sequenced data.
 Results:
 633 (15.1%) of the 4,206 AML featured
 NPM1
 GA (NPM1mut). Short variant mutations were found in >99% of the NPM1mut AML with the W288fs*12 frameshift base substitution accounting for 92.4% of cases. An
 NPM1
 -
 MLF1
 fusion was identified in 1.3% of NPM1mut cases. The NPM1mut+ were more frequently associated with female patients (53.4% vs 41.5%; p<.0001) and had a slightly higher median age compared to the NPM1 wild type (NPM1wt) AML patients (62yrs vs 60yrs; p<.0001). Majority of patients (>60%) were from European decent. There were greater NPM1 GA in patients with European (77.1% vs 68.5%; p<.0001) and lower with African ancestry (9.2% vs 10.2%; p<.0001). MSI High (0% in both groups) status, HRDsig+ (0—0.1%) and elevated TMB (median < 1 mutation/Mb) were extremely uncommon in both groups. GA more frequent in NPM1mut AML compared to the NPM1wt AML cohort included
 DNMT3A
 (39.2% vs 12.6%; p<.0001),
 FLT3
 (54.5% vs 14.7%; p<.0001)
 ,
 IDH1
 (16.1% vs 5.6%; p<.0001),
 IDH2
 (19.0% vs 9.0%; p<.0001),
 TET2
 (23.4% vs 13.5%; p<.0001) and
 WT1
 (12.5% vs 9.4% p=.02). GA more frequent in NPM1wt AML included
 ASXL1
 (17.1% vs 3.6%; p,.0001),
 BCOR
 (7.5% vs 1.6%; p<.0001),
 KMT2A
 (14.7% vs 0.2%; p<.0001),
 RUNX1
 (22.5% vs 1.9%; p-,.0001),
 STAG2
 (6.9% vs 1.6%; p<.0001) and
 TP53
 (19.1% vs 4.1%; p<.0001).
 Conclusions:
 The development of menin inhibitors has recently identified GA in
 NPM1
 as a promising target of therapy for AML patients. Other therapy targets in AML such as
 FLT3
 and
 IDH1/2
 are more frequently identified in NPM1mut than NPM1wt AML, while
 KMT2A
 is more frequently identified in NPM1wt AML. This genomic landscape study reveals significant differences in important GA associated with AML in NPM1mut and NPM1wt cases which may enrich our understanding of the molecular profile in AML and identify additional targets for therapy.

        <tr id="Renal cell carcinoma is characterized by a poor prognosis. Recently, renal cell carcinoma has been recognized as a metabolic disease associated with fatty acid metabolic reprogramming, although in-depth studies on this topic are still lacking. We found that fatty acid metabolism reprogramming in renal cell carcinoma is primarily characterized by high expression of FABP1. FABP1 + tumors significantly impact survival and display distinct differentiation trajectories compared to other tumor subclusters. They show elevated expression of angiogenesis and cell migration signals, with PLG-PLAT-mediated interactions with endothelial cells notably enhanced. Spatial transcriptomics show a prominent co-localization of FABP1 + tumors with endothelial cells, and their spatial distribution closely aligns with that of PLAT + endothelial cells. FABP1 + tumors exhibit a unique pattern in spatial transcriptomics, enriched in Extracellular Matrix and angiogenesis-related pathways. Through receptor-ligand interaction analysis, a novel PLG-PLAT functional axis was found between tumor epithelial cells and endothelial cells. Based on results of experiments, we infer that FABP1 + tumors can promote plasmin-related tumor angiogenesis by triggering the PLG-PLAT signaling axis. Finally, utilizing preclinical models, we suggest that targeting the FABP1-PLG-PLAT axis may serve as promising strategy enhancing the sensitivity of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor therapy.

        <tr id="Background CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), the repurposing of the RNA-guided endonuclease dCas9 as a programmable transcriptional repressor, allows highly specific repression (knockdown) of gene expression. CRISPRi platforms can often have incomplete knockdown, performance variability across cell lines and gene targets, and inconsistencies dependent on the guide RNA sequence employed. Results Here, we explore the combination of novel repressor domains with strong Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repressors, screening > 100 bipartite and tripartite fusion proteins for their ability to reduce gene expression as CRISPRi effectors. We show that these novel repressor fusions have reduced dependence on guide RNA sequences, better slow cell growth when used to knock down expression of essential genes, and function in either fusion or scaffold modalities. Furthermore, we isolate and characterize a particularly effective CRISPRi platform, dCas9-ZIM3(KRAB)-MeCP2(t), which shows improved gene repression of endogenous targets both at the transcript and protein level across several cell lines and when deployed in genome-wide screens. Conclusions We posit that these novel repressor fusions can enhance the reproducibility and utility of CRISPRi in mammalian cells.

        <tr id="The clinical and genetic presentation of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) ranges from indolent to aggressive, making it difficult to identify common therapeutic targets. Inhibiting EZH1/2 suppresses ATLL through epigenetic modulation; however, the diverse genetic background of ATLL precludes its mode of action from being clearly elucidated. We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of primary ATLL cells and identified an epigenetic regulative axis. First, flow cytometry showed that the proliferative potential of CADM1+ HTLV-1-infected cells ranges from stable to treatment-required. Second, scRNA-seq identified a CCR4+CD48- cluster, the population of which increased in treatment-required patients. In silico promoter analysis of this cluster identified a transcription factor YY1 as a candidate regulator. Intracellular flow cytometry confirmed that YY1 and EZH2 were upregulated in acute-type. By contrast, MLH1 but not MSH2 within CADM1+ cells was downregulated in remitted ATLL (p < 0.05), suggesting that MLH1 is associated with YY1/EZH2. Notably, lentiviral YY1 knockdown and the EZH1/2 inhibitor valemetostat downregulated MLH1 in ATLL cell lines and primary ATLL cells. Finally, knockdown of YY1 or MLH1 suppressed the proliferation of ATLL cells. Our findings suggest that YY1/EZH2 overexpression in the ATLL subpopulation defines aggressiveness and that MLH1 downregulation through YY1/EZH2 inhibition may be an effective treatment for aggressive ATLL.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
This study reviews how ionizing radiation (IR) induces alternative splicing (AS) in non-tumor and tumor cells under both ex vivo and in vivo irradiation conditions. The relevance and limitations of IR-induced AS in identifying potential biomarkers are highlighted for two main applications: biodosimetry and radiotherapy.


CONCLUSIONS
Radiation promotes alterations in AS, which may differentially affect the response in both tumor and non-tumor cells. This response can occur in genes that change their overall expression as well as in those that remain unaltered in response to IR. Although cis-regulators modulate AS, trans-regulators like splicing factors are more involved in the IR response. Variants of key genes involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) are regulated in non-tumor cells while they are often deregulated in tumor cells favoring radioresistance. Identifying IR-induced AS variants could enhance the sensitivity of biodosimeters for dose estimation and biomarkers for radiosensitivity, offering potential strategies to personalize radiotherapy and improve outcomes. New and advanced sequencing technologies will allow variant identification important for the field of radiobiological research.">

        <tr id="Temple syndrome is an imprinting disorder resulting from abnormal genomic or epigenomic aberrations of chromosome 14 including maternal uniparental disomy (matUPD), paternal deletion of 14q32, or aberrant methylation of the imprinting control regions at 14q32. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanism is essential to understanding the recurrence risk and physical effects. Currently, diagnosis requires the detection of aberrant methylation and copy number loss via methylation-sensitive assays such as methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and short tandem repeat analysis to detect matUPD and the presence of epimutation. Therefore, a one-step approach that can detect aberrant methylation and underlying genetic mechanisms would be of high clinical value. Here we use nanopore sequencing to delineate the molecular diagnosis of a case with Temple syndrome. We demonstrate the application of nanopore sequencing to detect aberrant methylation and underlying genetic mechanisms simultaneously in this case, thus providing a proof of concept for a one-step approach for molecular diagnosis of this disorder.">

        <tr id="An individual’s genetics contributes to their risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); however, there is still a large proportion of the heritability of ALS to be understood. Part of this missing heritability may lie in complex variants, such as the long interspersed element 1 (L1) retrotransposon, which have yet to be evaluated. The majority of L1 insertions in the human genome are no longer able to retrotranspose, but to date 279 retrotransposition-competent (RC) L1s have been reported. Many RC-L1s are polymorphic for their presence/absence; therefore, each individual will have a different number and complement of RC-L1s. These elements have been hypothesized to be involved in disease processes by multiple mechanisms such as somatic mutation by retrotransposition, the triggering of neuroinflammation and DNA damage. We hypothesize that L1s may influence disease development either through their effects on endogenous genes or through the properties that enable them to retrotranspose. Whole genome sequencing data from the New York Genome Center ALS consortium were used to characterize L1 variation identifying 2,803 polymorphic L1 elements and association analysis was performed in European individuals (ALS/ALS with other neurological disorder (ALSND) n = 2,653, controls n = 320). There were no individual L1 elements associated with disease, but we did identify a significant increase in the number of RC-L1s in ALS/ALSND genomes (p = 0.01) and the presence of ≥46 RC-L1s showed the most significant association (OR = 1.09 (1.02–1.16), p = 0.01) with disease. Analysis of individual L1s and their association with age at onset and survival identified one L1 whose presence was significantly associated with a lower age at onset (52.7 years) compared to homozygous absent individuals (59.2 years) (padj = 0.009). Our study has identified novel genetic factors for both disease risk and age at onset in ALS providing further evidence for the role of L1 retrotransposons in neurodegenerative diseases.">

 Background:
 Homologous recombination repair (HRR), a key pathway in DNA damage response (DDR), is linked to the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy, PARP inhibitors, and immunotherapy across cancers. However, its mutational landscape and impact on the immune microenvironment in gastric cancer remain unclear.
 Methods:
 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multiplex immunofluorescence were used to analyze the mutational profiles and immune microenvironment of 213 gastric cancer patients, focusing on the impact of HRR mutations.
 Results:
 Of the 213 patients, 67 (31.45%) harbored HRR mutations, including 46 with variants of uncertain significance (VOUS). The most frequently mutated HRR genes were RAD50 (4.69%), BLM (4.23%), and BRCA2(2.35%), with BLM/RAD50 co-mutations being the most common (2.35%). HRR mutations were significantly co-occurring with KMT2D mutations and mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations. We analyzed the association of HRR pathway mutations with immune biomarkers, stratifying patients by pathogenic/likely pathogenic and VOUS mutations. Pathogenic mutations were linked to high tumor mutational burden (TMB; p < 0.0001) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) status but showed no association with PD-L1 expression (CPS = 1/5/10) or EBV infection. Similar trends were seen for VOUS mutations. Further analysis of HRR mutation burden (≥2 mutated HRR genes) demonstrated an association with high TMB and MSI-H status, as well as a tendency toward positive PD-L1 CPS expression (CPS ≥ 1). Immune microenvironment analysis revealed that HRR- patients had higher proportions of M2 macrophages, suggesting polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. However, the M1/M2 macrophage ratio showed no significant difference, potentially due to compensatory effects from other immune cells. HRR- patients also displayed elevated CD56dim NK cells and a higher CD56dim/bright NK cell ratio, indicating a dominance of cytotoxic NK cells. In addition, HRR- patients had more CD4⁺ T cells (p = 0.0004) and a higher CD4/CD8 ratio, though not statistically significant. The observed infiltration of CD4⁺FOXP3⁻ T cells suggests that HRR mutations might influence immune cell composition and contribute to the formation of a non-inflammatory immune microenvironment in HRR-mutant gastric cancers.
 Conclusions:
 In gastric cancer, pathogenic/likely pathogenic HRR mutations are associated with higher TMB levels and MSI, while HRR variants of uncertain significance show a similar trend. Immune microenvironment analysis suggests that HRR pathway mutations may be linked to a non-inflammatory immune microenvironment. These findings indicate that HRR mutations could be relevant to the efficacy of immunotherapy in gastric cancer patients, warranting further investigation into their clinical value.

 Background:
 HIF2 alpha inhibitors (HIF2i) have been recently approved for VHL-related tumors, especially clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Alterations in genes that regulate HIF signaling may modulate response to HIF2i and may help identify tumor types that could benefit from new therapeutic approaches targeting HIF activity. Here, we describe the landscape of these alterations across different cancer types.
 Methods:
 This study included patients (pts) from the TCGA PanCancer Atlas and GENIE Cohort v17.0, across all cancer types. All pts underwent Next Generation Sequencing or OncoPanel analysis of their tumors. Alterations in genes related to the HIF pathway (
 VHL
 ,
 EPAS1
 ,
 EGLN1
 , and
 EGLN2
 ) and citric acid cycle (
 SDHA
 ,
 SDHB
 ,
 SDHC
 ,
 SDHD
 ,
 SDHAF1
 ,
 FH
 ,
 IDH1
 ,
 IDH2
 , and
 MDH2
 ) were screened, and only driver mutations, identified by OncoKB, CIViC Variants, My Cancer Genome, and the available literature, were included. Pts with a mutation in at least one gene were included. Mutation frequencies across different cancer types were analyzed for each cohort, then pooled together.
 Results:
 We identified a total of 10,953 and 167,073 pts on TCGA and GENIE, respectively. Mutation frequencies for different cancer types are shown in the Table. Among the mutated cases,
 IDH1
 was the most altered gene in glioma (90.20% [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 90.19; 90.21]), hepatobiliary cancers (75.48% [75.40; 75.56]) and melanoma (55.75% [55.57; 55.92]), and the second most common in leukemia (39.86% [39.68; 40.04]), while
 IDH2
 was the most altered in leukemia (57.52% [57.34; 57.70]), and the second most common in glioma (5.25% [5.24; 5.25]), and hepatobiliary cancers (19.10% [19.04; 19.17]).
 SDHA
 was the second most altered gene in melanoma (12.95% [12.87; 13.03]). In RCC,
 VHL
 was the most mutated gene (92.79% [92.78; 92.79]), followed by
 FH
 (2.41% [2.40; 2.41]).
 EPAS1
 was mutated in 64.19% of cases with driver mutations in miscellaneous neuroepithelial tumors (MNET) ([57.07; 71.31]), but not in RCC. Among the altered cases in pheochromocytoma,
 SDHB
 was the most commonly altered gene (39.71% [35.31; 44.11], followed by
 VHL
 (18.41% [15.92; 20.91]).
 SDHB
 was also the second most common gene to be mutated in MNET (23.12% [19.37; 26.86]).
 Conclusions:
 In this analysis, mutations in HIF-regulating genes were detected in multiple cancers, and were not limited to those studied in the context of HIF inhibitors. Further research is required to elucidate whether these gene alterations sensitize tumors to HIF inhibition.

        <tr id="Synthetic genetic materials, particularly those in genetically modified organisms (GMOs) deployed into complex environments, necessitate robust postmarket surveillance for continuous monitoring of both the materials and their applications throughout their lifecycle. Here, we introduce novel-coded genomic material for a blind mutation test that evaluates mutagenesis in synthetic genomic sequences without requiring direct sequence comparison. This test utilizes a Genome-Digest, which is embedded within essential genes, establishing mathematical correlation between the nucleotide sequence and codon order. This novel design allows for independent assessment of mutations by decoding the nucleotide sequence, thereby eliminating the need for reference sequences or extensive bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, the test has the capability to analyze mixed genomic materials from a single sample and can be extended to the pooled testing of multiple samples as well. Building on this framework, we propose the 'Genome-ShockWatch' methodology. In proof-of-concept trials, it successfully detected mutations that exceeded a predefined threshold in long-read sequencing data from a yogurt sample containing Genome-Digest encoded Nissle 1917 E. coli cells and naturally occurring probiotic bacteria. Consequently, the Genome-Digest system provides a robust foundation for the routine surveillance and management of GMOs and related synthetic products, ensuring their safety and efficacy in diverse environmental contexts.">

 Background:
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer with a dismal prognosis despite advances in treatment. PDAC is characterized by a dense stromal environment with suppressed anti-tumor immunity that contributes to treatment resistance. Oncogenic
 KRAS
 mutations are present in > 90% of PDACs and are known to play a role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). In this study, we examined the differences in TME components between
 KRAS
 -mutant (m) and
 KRAS
 -wildtype (wt) PDACs.
 Methods:
 Comprehensive genomic and immune profiling (CGIP), including the RNA-seq based gene expression assessment of 395 immune-associated genes, was performed on 311 PDAC patient samples. Gene expression signatures of tumor immunogenicity (TIGS) and cell proliferation were calculated by averaging the gene expression ranks of 161 immune-associated genes and 10 proliferation genes, respectively. The normalized gene expression rank of 22 immune checkpoint genes and 17 cancer testis antigen (CTA) genes were also calculated. DNA-seq was used to identify
 KRAS
 mutations and to calculated tumor mutational burden (TMB). Continuous variables were compared between subgroups using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test and categorical variables were compared between groups using the Chi Squared test. For statistical significance, p < 0.05 was required.
 Results:
 The cohort consisted of 311 PDAC patient samples, comprising 159 females (51.1%) and 152 males (48.9%) with a median age at testing of 69.3 years (38.7-92.6). A total of 264 specimens (84.9%) exhibited a
 KRAS
 mutation, with the most common being G12D and G12V while 47 (15.1%) had
 KRAS
 -wt tumors. No difference in TIGS, CP, or TMB was observed between
 KRAS
 -wt and
 KRAS
 -m tumors.
 KRAS
 -wt tumors exhibited greater expression of 12 of 17 tested CTAs than
 KRAS
 -m tumors, including GAGE13 (p = 0.004) NY-ESO-1 (p = 0.01), MAGEA3 (p = 0.01), and LAGE1A (p = 0.01). Analysis of the gene expression of 22 immune checkpoint genes showed no difference for most of the genes, though there was higher expression of PD-1 (p = 0.04) and CD27 (p = 0.03) seen in
 KRAS
 -wt compared to
 KRAS
 -m tumors.
 Conclusions:
 KRAS
 -wt PDACs exhibited greater expression of cancer testis antigen genes compared to
 KRAS
 -m tumors, suggesting potential therapeutic susceptibility to immunotherapy and adoptive cell therapies leveraging the expression of CTAs as targets. Assessment of
 KRAS
 status and immunotherapy susceptibility may support future clinical trial selections for therapies targeting the complex interplay of genomic and immune components of pancreatic cancer.

        <tr id="The Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) protein fulfills an important role in hematopoiesis via the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, as it provides the genetic driver of BCR::ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), which are clinically manifested as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The most common cause of MPNs is the mutation of JAK2 V617F in the JAK2 gene, which results in increased cell proliferation. However, both the pathogenesis and treatment regimen of BCR::ABL1-negative MPNs remain poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to establish K562 cell lines with a point mutation in exon 14 (JAK2p.V617F) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The modified JAK2 V617F cell lines were examined for the gene mutation using droplet digital PCR (DDPCR), and the presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Modified cells were characterized by measuring JAK2 gene expression and the extent of cell proliferation. Interferon α2a (IFN-α2a) and arsenic trioxide were also administered to the cells to explore their potential effects. The JAK2 V617F-mutated cells were found to exhibit a higher level of JAK2 gene expression compared with the wild type. Interestingly, a significant increase in the proliferation rate was observed with the modified cells compared with the wild type cells (p < 0.001), as assessed from the JAK2 gene expression levels. Furthermore, the treatments with IFN-α2a and arsenic trioxide led to the preferential suppression of the cell proliferation rate of the K562 expressing mutant JAK2 cells compared with the wild type cells, and this suppression occurred in a dose-dependent manner(p < 0.01). Moreover, the modified cells were able to differentiate into megakaryocyte-like cells following stimulation with phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate (PMA). Taken together, the results of the present study have shown that the CRISPR/Cas9-modified JAK2 V617F model may be used as a disease model in the search of novel therapies for MPNs.">

 The loss of chromosome 16q is the single most common genomic event in BC, occurring in over 50% of tumors. Despite this, the literature is focused almost exclusively on the importance of focal mutations that show a maximum frequency of ∼35-40%. We have modeled 16q loss by deleted this region in mammary epithelium of genetically modified mice. This event was sufficient to induce mammary tumor formation. This finding establishes for the first time that 16q is a BC-suppressing chromosome arm. We have gone on to identify two genes on 16q that can promote tumor formation when one copy is lost (Cbfb and Ankrd11, each in cooperation with Pik3caHR). We have also identified mutations that cooperate with 16q syntenic sequence loss in spontaneous tumors from our 16q mouse model (c-Met gene amplification and p53 mutation) as well as in a Sleeping Beauty transposon-based screen (identifying mutations that enhance Ras and Rho signaling). Finally, we have used transcriptional profiling and proteomics to compare matching mammary tumors with/without 16q-syntenic sequence loss, which revealed that hemizygous deletion of this region suppressed keratinocyte-like differentiation in mammary tumors.

        <tr id="Unchecked growth in three-dimensions (3D) in culture is a key feature of immortalized cells on the path to malignant transformation and hence a potential target phenotype for prevention. Also, expression of genes driving this process, but not that of 2D growth, would likely be more specific to cancer development and their inhibition would be less toxic to normal cells, many of which can grow in 2D but rarely in 3D culture. To define such genes, we compared CRISPR depletion screens performed in HBLAK, a spontaneously immortalized, non-tumorigenic human urothelial cell line, grown in 2D to those in 3D. Using the CRISPR Bassik DTKP (drug target kinase phosphatase) deletion library targeting 2,333 genes, we identified 85 genes which were specifically lost in 3D cultures. Prioritizing hits to those associated with bladder cancer in patients provided us with a set of 11 genes. Only one gene, MAPK1 remained relevant if a human pan-cancer criteria was applied. Single gene in vitro validation confirmed that MAPK1 inhibition was specific to 3D growth. We also found that MAPK1 depletion led to significant growth reductions in human tumor xenografts in vivo. Inhibition of MAPK1 by Ulixertinib, an orally active MAPK1 inhibitor, led to human bladder cancer growth inhibition in both 3D in vitro and in vivo models. In summary, screening for genes specifically driving 3D growth in immortalized cells may provide targets for both prevention and early therapy in bladder and other cancers while potentially limiting therapeutic toxicity.">

        <tr id="Despite the significant progress made in the development of epigenetic age (eAge) clocks designed to estimate the various aspects of aging, currently available models, generated using large DNA methylation microarray datasets, still cannot fully address the issues of batch effects and technical variation. This hinders the use of the publicly available eAge clocks in routine laboratory practice, and it motivates the development of cost-effective, custom epigenetic clocks that are tailored to the given biological subjects and research methods. In this study, we analyzed the local DNA methylation of mesenchymal stem cell samples during culture expansion using high-throughput targeted bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq). Using the obtained data, we trained a minimized eAge model based on a Random Forest Regression with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation, which determines cell passage with good performance (MAE 1.094 and R2 0.897) and which is comparable to previous solutions. Using the advantage of BS-seq to analyze consecutive CpGs methylation patterns, we demonstrated that combining the analysis of average DNA methylation levels with local methylation heterogeneity scores—thereby reflecting stochastic DNA methylation dynamics—can improve the quality of the epigenetic clock models. Therefore, we propose a research strategy for creating customized epigenetic clocks using targeted BS-seq and provide a mechanistic conceptualization of how information on longitudinal changes in DNA methylation patterns can potentially be used for the assessment of specific aging aspects.">

        <tr id="Mutational signatures of single-base substitutions (SBSs) characterize somatic mutation processes which contribute to cancer development and progression. However, current mutational signatures do not distinguish the two independent steps that generate SBSs: the initial DNA damage followed by erroneous repair. To address this modelling gap we developed DAMUTA, a hierarchical Bayesian probabilistic model that infers separate signatures for each process, and captures their sample-specific interaction. We applied DAMUTA to 18,974 pan-cancer whole genome sequencing mutation catalogues from 23 cancer types and show that tissue-specificity in mutation patterns is driven largely by variability in damage processes. We also show that misrepair processes are predictive of DNA damage response deficiencies. Unlike existing approaches, DAMUTA distinguishes damage from misrepair contributions, and we demonstrate significant improvements over a mutational-burden baseline or signatures from the COSMIC database. Our analysis reveals a shared pan-cancer pattern of early clonal transition-mutations which shifts to a more uniform substitution pattern consistent with increased reliance on translesion synthesis for damage tolerance. DAMUTA thus generates a compact set of signatures which resolves redundancies of current signature models, disentangles the effects of DNA damage and misrepair processes, and facilitates improved stratification of tumours, while providing a framework towards a unified pan-cancer model of the cellular response to DNA damage.">

        <tr id="The phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) plays a critical role in cell growth and survival. PIK3CA somatic mutations are linked to the PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) syndrome. Cells from those patients appeared to be associated with a moderate but significant radiosensitivity. Mutations or amplifications in this gene are common in breast, colorectal, and lung cancers. Alterations in the PIK3CA gene, including amplification and mutation, are common in cancer, but their influence on radiotherapy is not yet fully understood. This report reveals a potential association between PIK3CA gene modifications and radiosensitivity (p < 0.05) deducted from 8 established colorectal cancer cell lines (HT-29, DLD-1, HCT-116, SW480, HCT-15, Colo-320, and LoVo). Meanwhile gene amplification (> 2) seems to be linked to increased radiation sensitivity, mutations appear to be associated with increased radioresistance in colorectal cancer cells. Leveraging this relationship, PIK3CA amplification and mutations could act as biomarker to pinpoint patients who might benefit from more personalized radiotherapy regimens. However, this association is preliminary and hypothesis-generating in view of the limited number of cases. Further studies are needed to confirm this conclusion. By uncovering the distinct mechanistic effects of these PIK3CA alterations on radiosensitivity phenotype in both normal and cancerous cells, researchers can lay the groundwork for tailored radiotherapy strategies in colorectal cancer. This insight could enhance treatment effectiveness while reducing side effects, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Tumor protein p53 (TP53) is a crucial regulator of genomic integrity, frequently mutated in more than half of all human cancers. These mutations predominantly target the DNA-binding domain (DBD), impairing p53's interaction with DNA and its tumor-suppressive functions. To elucidate the structural and functional consequences of p53 mutations, we investigated 148 missense variants located within its DNA-binding interface using cutting-edge computational approaches. We employed AlphaFold3 (AF3) to predict p53-DNA complex structures, integrating these predictions with molecular dynamics (MD) and force-guided pulling simulations to assess mutation-induced changes in structural stability and DNA-binding properties. Moreover, we compared the results of our study with experimental in vitro enrichment scores (RFS) and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD). We identified a moderate negative correlation between plDDT and the pathogenicity of mutant variants, suggesting that mutations causing more significant alterations in the protein tertiary structure have a greater negative impact on cellular function. Moreover, we identified two possible structural mechanisms through which mutations can impair the p53 functionality. Specifically, some mutations, such as R248P and N239S, reduce the binding affinity of the p53-DNA complex, whereas others, such as C238Y and P278R, enhance affinity but compromise the structural stability of the complex. Furthermore, we uncovered mutations with potential rescuing effects, such as E285A and M243T, which preserved structural stability and enhanced the DNA-binding ability. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying p53 mutations and their role in cancer pathogenesis. This study highlights the value of integrative computational approaches in investigating protein-nucleic acid interactions, providing critical insights that can guide the development of therapeutic strategies targeting p53 mutations.">
