        <tr id="DHFR gene amplification is commonly present in methotrexate (MTX)-resistant colon cancer cells and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, we proposed an integrative framework to characterize the amplified region by using a combination of single-molecule real-time sequencing, next-generation optical mapping, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C). We identified an amplification unit spanning 11 genes, from the DHFR gene to the ATP6AP1L gene position, with high adjusted interaction frequencies on chromosome 5 (~2.2 Mbp) and a twenty-fold tandemly amplified region, and novel inversions at the start and end positions of the amplified region as well as frameshift insertions in most of the MSH and MLH genes were detected. These mutations might stimulate chromosomal breakage and cause the dysregulation of mismatch repair. Characterizing the tandem gene-amplified unit may be critical for identifying the mechanisms that trigger genomic rearrangements. These findings may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the amplification process and the evolution of drug resistance. Sequencing a large region of DNA containing many surplus copies of genes linked to drug resistance in colon cancer cells may illuminate how these genomic rearrangements arise. Such regions of gene amplification are highly repetitive, making them impossible to sequence using ordinary methods, and little is known about how they are generated. Using advanced methods, Jeong-Sun Seo at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital in South Korea and co-workers sequenced a region of gene amplification in colon cancer cells. The amplified region was approximately 20 times the length of that in healthy cells and contained many copies of an eleven-gene segment, including a gene implicated in drug resistance. The region also contained mutations in chromosomal repair genes which would disrupt repair pathways. These results illuminate the genetic changes that lead to gene amplification and drug resistance in cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Objective Ovarian cancer (OC) ranks among the foremost causes of mortality in gynecological malignancies, with chemoresistance being the primary factor contributing to unfavorable prognosis. This work seeks to clarify the mechanisms of resistance-related lactylation in OC, intending to offer novel theoretical foundations and therapy strategies for addressing chemoresistance. Methods Through the combined analysis of bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data, we initially found lactylation genes linked to chemoresistance. Subsequently, we employed differential expression analysis, survival analysis, enrichment analysis, and other methodologies to further investigate the roles and molecular mechanisms of these genes in tumor resistance. Ultimately, we investigated the differential expression of these genes in resistant and non-resistant tissues and cells via experimentation. Results We found two candidate genes associated with lactylation chemoresistance, ALDH1A1 and S100A4. Analysis of single-cell data indicated that tumor cells represent the primary cell subpopulation relevant to resistance studies. Subpopulation analysis indicated that several tumor cell subtypes were markedly linked to resistance, with elevated expression levels of ALDH1A1 and S100A4 in the resistant subpopulation, notably correlating with various immunological and metabolic pathways. Analysis of metabolic pathways indicated that oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis activity was elevated in the resistant subpopulation, and lactic acid buildup was associated with chemoresistance. The investigation of the marker gene protein-protein interaction network in the resistant subgroup elucidated the intricate interactions among these genes. The expression levels of ALDH1A1 and S100A4 in the OC tissues of the platinum-resistant cohort were markedly elevated compared to the sensitive cohort, with a considerable rise in S100A4 expression observed in resistant OC cells, demonstrating co-localization with lactylation. Conclusion This work elucidates the significant function of lactylation in OC chemoresistance and identifies ALDH1A1 and S100A4 as possible genes associated with drug resistance. These findings enhance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind chemoresistance in OC and offer critical insights for the formulation of novel therapeutic options.">

In vivo reprogramming studies have demonstrated that non-mutational epigenetic regulation can cause cellular reprogramming, leading to cancer development at the organismal level. Given that epigenetic regulation functions as an interface between the cellular environment and gene expression, these results suggest that intercellular communications in the tumor microenvironment play a critical role in cancer development. This review first introduces genetic aberrations that cause cancer development. Then, it illustrates the impact of epigenetic abnormalities in cancer, especially with reference to studies that use in vivo reprogramming technologies. Finally, it discusses the importance of histological evaluations of tumor tissue to understand non-cell-autonomous epigenetic regulation that establishes cancer hallmarks.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cancer has consistently posed a significant challenge on a global scale, with rising incidence and mortality. Despite the tremendous advancements in cancer therapeutics throughout the years, chemotherapy remains the current standard treatment in cancer management. As a result, chemotherapy resistance among cancer patients has emerged as a major clinical challenge, causing unsatisfactory responses to the treatment. Chemotherapy resistance is closely related to the dysregulation of a normal cellular process called ‘pre-mRNA Alternative Splicing’, where one gene can generate various protein forms with different structures and functions. A comprehensive understanding of dysregulated alternative splicing mechanisms is essential to propose novel strategies in cancer research aimed at identifying new and improved methods to maximise treatment efficacy and overcome chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, this review highlights the complexity of chemotherapy resistance and the potential roles of alternative splicing in overcoming resistance to chemotherapy.">

        <tr id="Cancer is heterogeneous and variability in drug sensitivity is widely documented across cancer types. Adaptive therapy is an emerging modality of cancer treatment that leverages this drug resistance heterogeneity to improve therapeutic outcomes. Current standard treatments typically eliminate a large fraction of drug-sensitive cells, leading to drug-resistant relapse due to competitive release. Adaptive therapy aims to retain some drug-sensitive cells, thereby limiting resistant cell growth by ecological competition. While early clinical trials of such a strategy have shown promise, optimisation of adaptive therapy is a subject of active study. Current methods largely assume cell phenotypes to remain constant, even though cell-state transitions could permit drug-sensitive and -resistant phenotypes to interchange and thus escape therapy. We address this gap using a deterministic model of population growth, in which sensitive and resistant cells grow under competition and undergo cell-state transitions. Based on the model’s steady-state behaviour and temporal dynamics, we identify distinct balances of competition and phenotypic transitions that are suitable for effective adaptive versus constant dose therapy. Our data indicate that under adaptive therapy, models with cell-state transitions show a higher frequency of fluctuations than those without, suggesting that the balance between ecological competition and phenotypic transitions could determine population-level dynamical properties. Our analyses also identify key limitations of applying phenomenological models in clinical practice for therapy design and implementation, particularly when cell-state transitions are involved. These findings provide an overall perspective on the relevance of phenotypic plasticity for emerging cancer treatment strategies using population dynamics as an investigation framework. Significance Statement Drug-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells can compete with each other within the same tumour, and adaptive therapy exploits this competition to control overall tumour growth. The fact that sensitive and resistant cell types can switch phenotypes complicates the implementation of adaptive therapy. Our ODE-based theoretical ecology framework shows that asymmetric competition favouring sensitive cells generally benefits therapy outcomes, while phenotypic plasticity is usually detrimental. Our model also provides cell population-level indicators that can help predict the underlying balance between competition and plasticity. Phenomenological models are limited by whether their parameters can be reliably identified given scarce data, and our study illuminates the scope of such models in understanding cancer population dynamics and the need for mechanistic modelling.">

        <tr id="Cancer stem cells (CSCs) as a subgroup of cells within a tumor capable of self-renewal, thereby driving tumor initiation and spread. Addressing treatment failures in cancer, linked to CSCs and their resistance mechanisms, requires effective preclinical models for testing targeted therapies. Caco2- and HT-29-resistant cells were generated by repeated treatment of cells with growing concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) anticancer drug for an extended time. The sensitivity of 5-FU-resistant cells was evaluated by cytotoxicity assay. Stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and drug resistance characteristics were assessed through gene expression investigation by real-time PCR. The expression of CD44, CD133, and CD66 were evaluated by flow cytometry. To end, the bioinformatic analysis estimated the molecular function and biological pathways considering the differential expression of selected genes and proteins. 5-FU-exposed cells displayed increased resistance to 5-FU. The gene expression analysis showed an upregulation of stemness genes (KLF4, SOX2, OCT4, C-MYC), enhanced scavenging system, and elevated expression of CSC surface markers (CD44 and CD133) compared to parental cells. Additionally, pro-EMT genes (TWIST1, SNAIL1, ZEB1, Vimentin, and N-cadherin) were significantly upregulated compared to parental cells, with the downregulation of E-cadherin as an EMT suppressor gene reflected in increased migration capacity. Moreover, increased expression of ABC transporter genes (ABCB1, ABCC1) was observed, correlating with enhanced drug resistance. The bioinformatic analysis highlighted pathways related to microRNAs in cancer, cells pluripotency, and proteoglycans. Methods of drug exposure take priority over spheroid formation, particularly due to their enhanced efficacy in stemness, EMT, and surface markers. This positions them as a promising protocol for establishing experimental models of CSCs.">

        <tr id="Introduction A hallmark of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is its recalcitrance to therapy. While most SCLCs respond to frontline therapy, resistance inevitably develops. Identifying phenotypes potentiating chemoresistance and immune evasion is a crucial unmet need. Previous reports have linked upregulation of the DNA damage response (DDR) machinery to chemoresistance and immune evasion across cancers. However, it is unknown if SCLCs exhibit distinct DDR phenotypes. Methods To study SCLC DDR phenotypes, we developed a new DDR gene analysis method and applied it to SCLC clinical samples, in vitro, and in vivo model systems. We then investigated how DDR regulation is associated with SCLC biology, chemotherapy response, and tumor evolution following therapy. Results Using multi-omic profiling, we demonstrate that SCLC tumors cluster into three DDR phenotypes with unique molecular features. Hallmarks of these DDR clusters include differential expression of DNA repair genes, increased replication stress, and heightened G2/M cell cycle arrest. SCLCs with elevated DDR phenotypes exhibit increased neuroendocrine features and decreased “inflamed” biomarkers, both within and across SCLC subtypes. Clinical analyses demonstrated treatment naive DDR status was associated with different responses to frontline chemotherapy. Using longitudinal liquid biopsies, we found that DDR Intermediate and High tumors exhibited subtype switching and coincident emergence of heterogenous phenotypes following frontline treatment. Conclusions We establish that SCLC can be classified into one of three distinct, clinically relevant DDR clusters. Our data demonstrates that DDR status plays a key role in shaping SCLC phenotypes and may be associated with different chemotherapy responses and patterns of tumor evolution. Future work targeting DDR specific phenotypes will be instrumental in improving patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Background Glioblastoma (GBM) patients frequently develop resistance to temozolomide (TMZ), the standard chemotherapy. While targeting cancer metabolism shows promise, the relationship between metabolic perturbation and drug resistance remains poorly understood. Methods We performed high-throughput CRISPR interference screens in GBM cells to identify genes modulating TMZ sensitivity. Findings were validated using multiple GBM cell lines, patient-derived glioma stem cells, and clinical data. Molecular mechanisms were investigated through transcriptome analysis, metabolic profiling, and functional assays. Results We identified phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) as a key determinant of TMZ sensitivity. Paradoxically, while PGK1 inhibition suppressed tumor growth, it enhanced TMZ resistance by inducing metabolic stress. This activated AMPK and HIF-1α pathways, leading to enhanced DNA damage repair through 53BP1. PGK1 expression levels correlated with TMZ sensitivity across multiple GBM models and patient samples. Conclusions Our study reveals an unexpected link between metabolic stress and chemoresistance, demonstrating how metabolic adaptation can promote therapeutic resistance. These findings caution against single-agent metabolic targeting and suggest PGK1 as a potential biomarker for TMZ response in GBM.

        <tr id="Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer deaths; nonetheless, how tumor cells adapt to vastly different organ contexts is largely unknown. To investigate this question, we generated a transcriptomic atlas of primary tumor and diverse metastatic samples from a patient with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent rapid autopsy. Unsupervised archetype analysis identified both shared and site-specific gene programs, including lipid metabolism and gastrointestinal programs prevalent in peritoneum and stomach wall lesions, respectively. We developed a probabilistic approach for inferring clonal phylogeny from single-cell and matched whole-exome data. Distantly related genetic clones in the peritoneum express the lipid metabolism program, likely due to signaling by the adipocyte-rich peritoneum environment, and cells in most clones express multiple programs, suggesting that transcriptomic plasticity is a prevalent feature of metastatic cells. These deeply annotated analyses using a patient-centric platform provide a model for investigating metastatic mechanisms and plasticity in advanced cancer.">

        <tr id="Tumor subclones refer to distinct cell populations within the same tumor that possess different genetic characteristics. They play a crucial role in understanding tumor heterogeneity, evolution, and therapeutic resistance. The formation of tumor subclones is driven by several key mechanisms, including the inherent genetic instability of tumor cells, which facilitates the accumulation of novel mutations; selective pressures from the tumor microenvironment and therapeutic interventions, which promote the expansion of certain subclones; and epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, which alter gene expression patterns. Major methodologies for studying tumor subclones include single-cell sequencing, liquid biopsy, and spatial transcriptomics, which provide insights into clonal architecture and dynamic evolution. Beyond their direct involvement in tumor growth and invasion, subclones significantly contribute to tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and treatment resistance. Thus, an in-depth investigation of tumor subclones not only aids in guiding personalized precision therapy, overcoming drug resistance, and identifying novel therapeutic targets, but also enhances our ability to predict recurrence and metastasis risks while elucidating the mechanisms underlying tumor heterogeneity. The integration of artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and multi-omics technologies is expected to further advance research in tumor subclones, paving the way for novel strategies in cancer diagnosis and treatment. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of tumor subclone formation mechanisms, evolutionary models, analytical methods, and clinical implications, offering insights into precision oncology and future translational research.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a hallmark of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency that leads to genomic instability and increased cancer risk. The tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly influences MSI‐driven tumorigenesis, and emerging evidence points to a critical role of the microbiome in shaping this complex interplay. Methods This review comprehensively examines the existing literature on the intricate relationship between MSI, microbiome, and cancer development, with a particular focus on the impact of microbial dysbiosis on the TME. Results MSI‐high tumors exhibited increased immune cell infiltration owing to the generation of neoantigens. However, immune evasion mechanisms such as PD‐1/CTLA‐4 upregulation limit the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in a subset of patients. Pathobionts, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis, contribute to MSI through the production of genotoxins, further promoting inflammation and oxidative stress within the TME. Conclusions The microbiome profoundly affects MSI‐driven tumorigenesis. Modulation of the gut microbiota through interventions such as fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, and dietary changes holds promise for improving ICI response rates. Further research into cancer pharmacomicrobiomics, investigating the interplay between microbial metabolites and anticancer therapies, is crucial for developing personalized treatment strategies.">

Here, we use a lineage-tracing system, ClonMapper, which couples heritable clonal identifying tags with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), to better elucidate the response to doxorubicin in a model of TNBC. We demonstrate that, while there is a dose-dependent reduction in overall clonal diversity, there is no pre-existing resistance signature among surviving clones. Separately, we found the existence of two transcriptomically distinct clonal subpopulations that remain through the course of treatment. Among clones persisting across multiple samples we identified divergent phenotypes, suggesting a response to treament independent of clonal identity. Finally, a subset of clones harbor novel changes in expression following treatment. The clone and sample specific responses to treatment identified herein highlight the need for better personalized treatment strategies to overcome tumor heterogeneity.">

        <tr id="Genome sequencing of cancer and normal tissues, alongside single-cell transcriptomics, continues to produce findings that challenge the idea that cancer is a 'genetic disease', as posited by the somatic mutation theory (SMT). In this prevailing paradigm, tumorigenesis is caused by cancer-driving somatic mutations and clonal expansion. However, results from tumor sequencing, motivated by the genetic paradigm itself, create apparent 'paradoxes' that are not conducive to a pure SMT. But beyond genetic causation, the new results lend credence to old ideas from organismal biology. To resolve inconsistencies between the genetic paradigm of cancer and biological reality, we must complement deep sequencing with deep thinking: embrace formal theory and historicity of biological entities, and (re)consider non-genetic plasticity of cells and tissues. In this Essay, we discuss the concepts of cell state dynamics and tissue fields that emerge from the collective action of genes and of cells in their morphogenetic context, respectively, and how they help explain inconsistencies in the data in the context of SMT.">

        <tr id="Understanding lung cancer evolution can identify tools for intercepting its growth. In a landscape analysis of 1024 lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) with deep whole-genome sequencing integrated with multiomic data, we identified 542 LUAD that displayed diverse clonal architecture. In this group, we observed an interplay between mobile elements, endogenous and exogenous mutational processes, distinct driver genes, and epidemiological features. Our results revealed divergent evolutionary trajectories based on tobacco smoking exposure, ancestry, and sex. LUAD from smokers showed an abundance of tobacco-related C:G>A:T driver mutations in KRAS plus short subclonal diversification. LUAD in never smokers showed early occurrence of copy number alterations and EGFR mutations associated with SBS5 and SBS40a mutational signatures. Tumors harboring EGFR mutations exhibited long latency, particularly in females of European-ancestry (EU_N). In EU_N, EGFR mutations preceded the occurrence of other driver genes, including TP53 and RBM10. Tumors from Asian never smokers showed a short clonal evolution and presented with heterogeneous repetitive patterns for the inferred mutational order. Importantly, we found that the mutational signature ID2 is a marker of a previously unrecognized mechanism for LUAD evolution. Tumors with ID2 showed short latency and high L1 retrotransposon activity linked to L1 promoter demethylation. These tumors exhibited an aggressive phenotype, characterized by increased genomic instability, elevated hypoxia scores, low burden of neoantigens, propensity to develop metastasis, and poor overall survival. Re-activated L1 retrotransposition-induced mutagenesis can contribute to the origin of the mutational signature ID2, including through the regulation of the transcriptional factor ZNF695, a member of the KZFP family. The complex nature of LUAD evolution creates both challenges and opportunities for screening and treatment plans.">

        <tr id="Development of next generation sequencing technologies allows to identify a large number of genetic landscape types in various cancers including breast cancer. Frequent genetic abnormalities identified using whole genome sequencing are point mutations (missense, nonsense mutations), deletions, insertions, which usually lead to activation of protooncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Genome sequencing of malignant tumors allowed, on one hand, to identify driver mutations in carcinogenic genes in different organs, and on the other – to use mutated genes for targeted therapy. Study of biological functions of these genes from the point of view of their contribution to carcinogenesis allows to better understand its mechanism. In this review, signaling cascades of breast cancer with identified mutated genes – targets for therapy – are analyzed.">

        <tr id="Although two-thirds of cancers arise from loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes, there are few approved targeted therapies linked to these alterations. Synthetic lethality offers a promising strategy to treat such cancers by targeting vulnerabilities unique to cancer cells with these mutations. To identify clinically relevant synthetic lethal interactions, we analyzed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out (KO) viability screens from the Cancer Dependency Map and evaluated their clinical relevance in patient tumors through mutual exclusivity, a pattern indicative of synthetic lethality. Indeed, we found significant enrichment of mutual exclusivity for interactions involving cancer driver genes compared to non-driver mutations. To identify therapeutic opportunities, we integrated drug sensitivity data to identify inhibitors that mimic the effects of CRISPR-mediated KO. This approach revealed potential drug repurposing opportunities, including BRD2 inhibitors for bladder cancers with ARID1A mutations and SIN3A-mutated cell lines showing sensitivity to nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors. However, we discovered that pharmacological inhibitors often fail to phenocopy KO of matched drug targets, with only a small fraction of drugs inducing similar effects. This discrepancy reveals fundamental differences between pharmacological and genetic perturbations, emphasizing the need for approaches that directly assess the interplay of loss-of-function mutations and drug activity in cancer models. Author Summary Synthetic lethality is an emerging approach for targeting a biological dependency in cancer cells that does not harm normal cells. This strategy is particularly valuable for targeting loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes, which are more challenging to directly target. In an effort to accelerate treatments for cancer patients, we aimed to map out these dependencies and overlap them with responses to available drugs. We discovered different outcomes when a protein is targeted by a drug versus when that same target is disrupted genetically. Thus, if a drug is to be effectively repurposed as synthetic lethal agent, feasibility studies must capture drug biology, ideally by test the drug empirically in relevant cancer models. A second notable discovery is that in vitro synthetic lethal interactions involving cancer driver genes are significantly more likely to exhibit consistent patterns, such as mutual exclusivity in human tumor samples. This is important since selection of relevant cell lines is often critical in drug development to maximize potential for translation to clinical responses.">

        <tr id="Cancer stem cells (CSCs), are a critical subpopulation within tumours, and are defined by their capacity for self-renewal, differentiation, and tumour initiation. These unique traits contribute to tumour progression, metastasis, and resistance to conventional treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy, often resulting in cancer recurrence and poor patient outcomes. As such, CSCs have become focal points in developing advanced cancer therapies. This review highlights progress in CSC-targeted treatments, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, immunotherapy, molecular targeting, and nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. Plant-derived compounds and gene-editing technologies, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), are explored for their potential to enhance precision and minimize side effects. Metabolic pathways integral to CSC survival, such as mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy (regulated by dynamin-related protein 1 [DRP1] and the PINK1/Parkin pathway), one-carbon metabolism, amino acid metabolism (involving enzymes like glutaminase (GLS) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH]), lipid metabolism, and hypoxia-induced metabolic reprogramming mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1α and HIF-2α), are examined as therapeutic targets. The adaptability of CSCs through autophagy, metabolic flexibility, and epigenetic regulation by metabolites like α-ketoglutarate, succinate, and fumarate is discussed. Additionally, extracellular vesicles and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) metabolism are identified as pivotal in redox balance, DNA repair, and epigenetic modifications. Addressing challenges such as tumour heterogeneity, immune evasion, and treatment durability requires interdisciplinary collaboration. Advancing CSC-targeted therapies is essential for overcoming drug resistance and preventing cancer relapse, paving the way for transformative cancer treatments. This review underscores the importance of leveraging innovative technologies and fostering collaboration to revolutionize cancer treatment. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="Cancer cells adapt to treatment, leading to the emergence of clones that are more aggressive and resistant to anti-cancer therapies. We have a limited understanding of the development of treatment resistance as we lack technologies to map the evolution of cancer under the selective pressure of treatment. To address this, we developed a hierarchical, dynamic lineage tracing method called FLARE (Following Lineage Adaptation and Resistance Evolution). We use this technique to track the progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines through exposure to Cytarabine (AraC), a front-line treatment in AML, in vitro and in vivo. We map distinct cellular lineages in murine and human AML cell lines predisposed to AraC persistence and/or resistance via the upregulation of cell adhesion and motility pathways. Additionally, we highlight the heritable expression of immunoproteasome 11S regulatory cap subunits as a potential mechanism aiding AML cell survival, proliferation, and immune escape in vivo. Finally, we validate the clinical relevance of these signatures in the TARGET-AML cohort, with a bisected response in blood and bone marrow. Our findings reveal a broad spectrum of resistance signatures attributed to significant cell transcriptional changes. To our knowledge, this is the first application of dynamic lineage tracing to unravel treatment response and resistance in cancer, and we expect FLARE to be a valuable tool in dissecting the evolution of resistance in a wide range of tumor types.">

        <tr id="Pharmacogenomics is revolutionizing precision medicine by enabling tailored therapeutic strategies based on an individual genetic and molecular profile. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a distinct subclass of endogenous non-coding RNAs, have recently emerged as key regulators of drug resistance, tumor progression, and therapeutic responses. Their covalently closed circular structure provides exceptional stability and resistance to exonuclease degradation, positioning them as reliable biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets in cancer management. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between circRNAs and pharmacogenomics, focusing on their role in modulating drug metabolism, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity profiles. We examine how circRNA-mediated regulatory networks influence chemotherapy resistance, alter targeted therapy responses, and impact immunotherapy outcomes. Additionally, we discuss emerging experimental tools and bioinformatics techniques for studying circRNAs, including multi-omics integration, machine learning-driven biomarker discovery, and high-throughput sequencing technologies. Beyond their diagnostic potential, circRNAs are being actively explored as therapeutic agents and drug delivery vehicles. Recent advancements in circRNA-based vaccines, engineered CAR-T cells, and synthetic circRNA therapeutics highlight their transformative potential in oncology. Furthermore, we address the challenges of standardization, reproducibility, and clinical translation, emphasizing the need for rigorous biomarker validation and regulatory frameworks to facilitate their integration into clinical practice. By incorporating circRNA profiling into pharmacogenomic strategies, this review underscores a paradigm shift toward highly personalized cancer therapies. circRNAs hold immense potential to overcome drug resistance, enhance treatment efficacy, and optimize patient outcomes, marking a significant advancement in precision oncology.">

        <tr id="Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in colorectal cancer (CRC) development and progression. Recent developments in single-cell transcriptome profiling methods have revealed surprising levels of expression variability among seemingly homogeneous cells, suggesting the existence of many more cell types than previously estimated. This review synthesizes recent advances in ncRNA research in CRC, emphasizing single-cell bioinformatics approaches for their analysis. We explore computational methods and tools used for ncRNA identification, characterization, and functional prediction in CRC, with a focus on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The review highlights key bioinformatics strategies, including sequence-based and structure-based approaches, machine learning applications, and multi-omics data integration. We discuss how these computational techniques can be applied to analyze differential expression, perform functional enrichment, and construct regulatory networks involving ncRNAs in CRC. Additionally, we examine the role of bioinformatics in leveraging ncRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for CRC. We also discuss recent scRNA-seq studies revealing ncRNA heterogeneity in CRC. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of single-cell bioinformatics in ncRNA CRC research and outline future directions in this rapidly evolving field, emphasizing the integration of computational approaches with experimental validation to advance our understanding of ncRNA biology in CRC.">

        <tr id="Background Chromosomal instability (CIN) is involved in about 70% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) and is associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance. From a clinical perspective, a better knowledge of these tumour’s biology will help to guide therapeutic strategies more effectively. Methods We used high-density chromosomal microarray analysis to evaluate CIN level of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and their original mCRC tissues. We integrated the RNA-seq and mass spectrometry-based proteomics data from PDOs in a functional interaction network to identify the significantly dysregulated processes in CIN. This was followed by a proteome-wGII Pearson correlation analysis and an in silico validation of main findings using functional genomic databases and patient-tissues datasets to prioritize the high-confidence CIN features. Results By applying the weighted Genome Instability Index (wGII) to identify CIN, we classified PDOs and demonstrated a good correlation with tissues. Multi-omics analysis showed that our organoids recapitulated genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic CIN features of independent tissues cohorts. Thanks to proteotranscriptomics, we uncovered significant associations between mitochondrial metabolism and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in CIN CRC PDOs. Correlating PDOs wGII with protein abundance, we identified a subset of proteins significantly correlated with CIN. Co-localisation analysis in PDOs strengthened the putative role of IPO7 and YAP, and, through in silico analysis, we found that some of the targets give significant dependencies in cell lines with CIN compatible status. Conclusions We first demonstrated that PDO models are a faithful reflection of CIN tissues at the genetic and phenotypic level. Our new findings prioritize a subset of genes and molecular processes putatively required to cope with the burden on cellular fitness imposed by CIN and associated with disease aggressiveness.

        <tr id="Bone metastases represent frequent and severe complications in various cancers, notably impacting prognosis and quality of life. This review article delves into the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underpinning drug resistance in bone metastases, a key challenge in effective cancer treatment. The development of drug resistance in cancer can manifest as either intrinsic or acquired, with genetic heterogeneity playing a pivotal role. Intrinsic resistance is often due to pre-existing mutations, while acquired resistance evolves through genetic and epigenetic alterations during treatment. These alterations include mutations in driver genes like TP53 and RB1, epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone changes, and pathway alterations, notably involving RANK-RANKL signaling and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade. Recent studies underline the significance of the tumor microenvironment in fostering drug resistance, with components such as cancer-associated fibroblasts and hypoxia playing crucial roles. The interactions between metastatic cancer cells and the bone microenvironment facilitate survival and the proliferation of drug-resistant clones. This review highlights the necessity of understanding these complex interactions to develop targeted therapies that can overcome resistance and improve treatment outcomes. Current therapeutic strategies and future directions are discussed, emphasizing the integration of genomic profiling and targeted interventions in managing bone metastases. The evolving landscape of genetic research, including the application of next-generation sequencing and CRISPR technology, offers promising avenues for novel and more effective therapeutic strategies. This comprehensive exploration aims to provide insights into the molecular intricacies of drug resistance in bone metastases, paving the way for improved clinical management and patient care.">

        <tr id="Background Two genes are synthetically lethal if loss of function of either one of the two genes does not result in cell death, whereas loss of function of both genes together results in being detrimental to cell survival. This concept has been the basis for developing personalized, precision treatments, which can selectively damage tumor cells and minimize toxicity to normal tissues. Tumor cells often harbor mutations in genes involved in DNA repair pathways, forcing them to switch to alternative repair pathways, leading to chemotherapeutic resistance. These interactions, if targeted, could be synthetically lethal. We aimed to summarize synthetically lethal gene pairs that could be utilized to selectively target cancer cells and minimize side effects on normal tissues. The objective of this review is to study druggable synthetically lethal gene pairs for targeted cancer therapy that have been identified through various genetic screens and functional studies. Methods A systematic literature search will be conducted to extract synthetically lethal gene pairs that can be specifically targeted to cancer cells. Owing to the relatively recent research pertaining to this field, the literature search will incorporate data from 1956. The search will be conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus. The narrative approach will guide the analysis and synthesis of the results. Discussion This review highlights scientific articles that report druggable synthetically lethal gene pairs by testing the efficacy of targeted inhibitors in clonogenic assays. These include research studies that identify synthetically lethal gene pairs detected through CRISPR screens by knocking out one or two genes within the same cell and testing the potency of inhibitors to specifically kill malignant cells.

        <tr id="Heterogeneity is inherent to living organisms and it determines cell fate and phenotypic variability. Despite its ubiquity, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the genetic basis linking genotype to-phenotype heterogeneity remain a central challenge. Here we construct a yeast knockout library with a clone and genotype RNA barcoding structure suitable for genome-scale analyses to generate a high-resolution single-cell yeast transcriptome atlas of 3500 mutants under control and stress conditions. We find that transcriptional heterogeneity reflects the coordinated expression of specific gene programs, generating a continuous of cell states that can be responsive to external insults. Cell state plasticity can be genetically modulated with mutants that act as state attractors and disruption of state homeostasis results in decreased adaptive fitness. Leveraging on intra-genetic variability, we establish that regulators of transcriptional heterogeneity are functionally diverse and influenced by the environment. Our multimodal perturbation-based single-cell Genotype-to-Transcriptome Atlas in yeast provides insights into organism-level responses.">

        <tr id="Therapy resistance in breast cancer is increasingly attributed to polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs), which arise through whole genome doubling and exhibit heightened resilience to standard treatments. Characterized by enlarged nuclei and increased DNA content, these cells tend to be dormant under therapeutic stress, driving disease relapse. Despite their critical role in resistance, strategies to effectively target PGCCs are limited, largely due to the lack of high-throughput methods for assessing their viability. Traditional assays lack the sensitivity needed to detect PGCC-specific elimination, prompting the development of novel approaches. To address this challenge, we developed a high-throughput single-cell morphological analysis workflow designed to differentiate compounds that selectively inhibit non-PGCCs, PGCCs, or both. Using this method, we screened a library of 2726 FDA Phase 1-approved drugs, identifying promising anti-PGCC candidates, including proteasome inhibitors, FOXM1, CHK, and macrocyclic lactones. Notably, RNA-Seq analysis of cells treated with the macrocyclic lactone Pyronaridine revealed AXL inhibition as a potential strategy for targeting PGCCs. Although our single-cell morphological analysis pipeline is powerful, empirical testing of all existing compounds is impractical and inefficient. To overcome this limitation, we trained a machine learning model to predict anti-PGCC efficacy in silico, integrating chemical fingerprints and compound descriptions from prior publications and databases. The model demonstrated a high correlation with experimental outcomes and predicted efficacious compounds in an expanded library of over 6,000 drugs. Among the top-ranked predictions, we experimentally validated five compounds as potent PGCC inhibitors using cell lines and patient-derived models. These findings underscore the synergistic potential of integrating high-throughput empirical screening with machine learning-based virtual screening to accelerate the discovery of novel therapies, particularly for targeting therapy-resistant PGCCs in breast cancer.">

        <tr id="In recent years, synthetic lethality has become an important theme in the field of targeted cancer therapy. Synthetic lethality refers to simultaneous defects in two or more genes leading to cell death, whereas defects in any single gene do not lead to cell death. Taking advantage of the genetic vulnerability that exists within cancer cells, it theoretically has no negative impact on healthy cells and has fewer side effects than non-specific chemotherapy. Currently, targeted cancer therapies focus on inhibiting key pathways in cancer. However, it has been found that over-activation of oncogenic-related signaling pathways can also induce cancer cell death, which is a major breakthrough in the new field of targeted therapies. In this review, we summarize the conventional gene targets in synthetic lethality (PARP, ATR, ATM, WEE1, PRMT) and provide an in-depth analysis of their latest potential mechanisms. We explore the impact of over-activation of pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and WNT on cancer cell survival, and present the technical challenges of current research. Important theoretical foundations and insights are provided for the application of synthetic lethal strategies in cancer therapy, as well as future research directions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Lynch syndrome (LS), caused by germline pathogenic variants in the mismatch repair genes, leads to high rates of frameshift-derived neopeptide (FSDN) expression due to microsatellite instability (MSI). While colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention is effective, most LS-related tumors lack such strategies. Cancer vaccines targeting FSDNs offer a promising approach for immune interception in LS. This study aimed to identify and validate LS-related FSDNs to develop vaccines for cancer prevention. Methods We identified LS-related coding MS mutations and predicted FSDN with high coverage on common Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-I and II alleles. We validated FSDN-associated mutations in colorectal adenomas (CrAD), endometrial cancers (EC), and CRC samples from patients with LS, non-LS tumors, and cell lines. Immunogenicity was assessed through interferon (IFN)-γ enzyme-linked immunospot and flow cytometry analysis of tissue-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from LS carriers. Results We prioritized 53 HLA-I and 45 HLA-II FSDNs in MSI tumors using in silico predictions. Validation revealed 86.7% of FSDN-associated mutations present in LS-CRC samples, with a median of 7.67 (6.5–9) mutations in CrADs and 6.02 (2–10) in CRCs. Sequencing of CrAD and EC samples showed 95% and 77.5% of predicted FSDN-associated mutations, respectively. MSI cancer cell lines transcribed 69.8% of FSDNs. Immunogenicity assays showed that 71% of potential FSDNs elicited IFN-γ responses, with a median of 7.37 (1–10.75) HLA-I and 6 (2–5.75) HLA-II FSDNs per patient. After prioritizing 24 FSDN, in a cohort of 19 LS-derived samples (4 CrAD and 15 normal mucosa), 52% (10/19) demonstrated T-cell reactivity to an HLA-I neoantigen pool. CD8+CD137+ activation markers increased significantly (p=0.037) over time and peptide-specific cells were detected by pentamer staining. Conclusions Our predicted FSDN set has optimal coverage among LS carriers and can induce IFN-γ inflammatory responses in LS-derived TILs, offering an opportunity for vaccine development.">

Equally important are a series of discoveries that have established epigenetic mechanisms, defined as the control of gene expression by non-DNA-encoded regulation, mediated by an evolving histone code that supports chromatin states, as complementary and obligatory determinants for biological activity. Evidence is accruing for pivotal contributions by epigenetic parameters of control to gene expression that is required for development and differentiation as well as for transient and sustained responsiveness to physiological regulatory cues that support cell structure, function, cell survival, tissue repair and remodeling.

        <tr id="Aim: As intrinsic resistance - often driven by concurrent genomic alterations in tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes - remains a major challenge in oncology, this work aimed to comprehensively analyze BRAF somatic alterations across cancer types and identify new potential therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance. Methods: We conducted an extensive analysis of genomics, transcriptomics, and clinical data retrieved from public repositories, including cBioPortal. Our comprehensive analysis examined BRAF alterations [point mutations, structural variants (SVs) and copy number alteration] in more than 217,000 tumor samples across 120 distinct tumor types from primary and metastatic sites in both adult and pediatric cohorts, focusing on mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of mutations in other oncogenes or tumor suppressors. The work also explores the association of BRAF somatic alterations with survival, clinical and molecular features. Results: Analysis of mutation frequencies across cancer types revealed that BRAFV600E represents approximately 90% of all BRAF alterations. While melanoma and thyroid carcinoma show the highest prevalence of BRAF mutations, followed by colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer in terms of absolute number of patients harboring BRAF mutations worldwide, notably high mutation frequencies were identified in rare malignancies, including hairy-cell leukemia, ganglioglioma, and serous borderline ovarian tumors. The comprehensive analysis of genomic profiling data across these tumors uncovered distinct patterns of co-occurring and mutually exclusive alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, illuminating resistance mechanisms and suggesting novel therapeutic combinations.

        <tr id="Background & Aims Patients with colorectal cancer have heterogeneous clinical responses to chemotherapy, although clinical guidelines advise little variability in treatment selection based on molecular tumor features. Precision oncology research typically utilizes patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTO) to predict clinical outcomes, but such efforts are often not directed towards identification of molecular factors underlying differential responses to therapy. Methods Bulk RNA-sequencing was performed on treatment-naive PDTOs, and gene expression data was combined to drug sensitivity data to identify transcriptomic features associated with low in vitro sensitivity to chemotherapy. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on primary tumors to infer the somatic mutations of PDTOs and used to identify somatic mutations associated with differential in vitro drug responses. Publicly available gene expression and drug sensitivity data sets were used to validate the results. RNA interference was used for functional validation. Results PDTOs with low chemosensitivity had high JAK-STAT pathway activity resulting from high expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Evidence from single-cell RNA-sequencing confirmed chemotherapy-induced expression of interferon-stimulated genes in epithelial cells of cancers with partial response. EPSTI1 knockdown decreased cancer cell viability and sensitized cells to chemotherapy. Conclusions Sustained interferon signaling in epithelial cancer cells contributes to incomplete pathologic response in colorectal cancer. The findings highlight the potential of JAK-STAT inhibition or TRAIL pathway activation to enhance chemotherapy efficacy. Future studies investigating pharmacologic modulation of these pathways in preclinical CRC models are needed to determine their viability as therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Background About 40% of relapsed or non-responder tumors exhibit therapeutic resistance in the absence of a clear genetic cause, suggesting a pivotal role of intracellular communication. A deeper understanding of signaling pathways rewiring occurring in resistant cells is crucial to propose alternative effective strategies for cancer patients. Methods To achieve this goal, we developed a novel multi-step strategy, which integrates high sensitive mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics with network-based analysis. This strategy builds context-specific networks recapitulating the signaling rewiring upon drug treatment in therapy-resistant and sensitive cells. Results We applied this strategy to elucidate the BCR::ABL1-independent mechanisms that drive relapse upon therapy discontinuation in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. We built a signaling map, detailing - from receptor to key phenotypes - the molecular mechanisms implicated in the control of proliferation, DNA damage response and inflammation of therapy-resistant cells. In-depth analysis of this map uncovered novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. Functional validation in patient-derived leukemic stem cells revealed a crucial role of acquired FLT3-dependency and its underlying molecular mechanism. Conclusions In conclusion, our study presents a novel generally applicable strategy and the reposition of FLT3, one of the most frequently mutated drivers of acute leukemia, as a potential therapeutic target for CML relapsed patients.

        <tr id="The DNA damage response (DDR) is a multifaceted network of pathways that preserves genome stability1,2. Unravelling the complementary interplay between these pathways remains a challenge3,4. Here we used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening to comprehensively map the genetic interactions required for survival during normal human cell homeostasis across all core DDR genes. We captured known interactions and discovered myriad new connections that are available online. We defined the molecular mechanism of two of the strongest interactions. First, we found that WDR48 works with USP1 to restrain PCNA degradation in FEN1/LIG1-deficient cells. Second, we found that SMARCAL1 and FANCM directly unwind TA-rich DNA cruciforms, preventing catastrophic chromosome breakage by the ERCC1–ERCC4 complex. Our data yield fundamental insights into genome maintenance, provide a springboard for mechanistic investigations into new connections between DDR factors and pinpoint synthetic vulnerabilities that could be exploited in cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults and the second most common in children. Despite the introduction of targeted therapies, AML survival rates have shown limited improvement, particularly among older patients. This study explored personalized treatment strategies for AML by proposing a novel subtyping method. Through unsupervised clustering based on the enrichment scores of 14 pathways related to metabolism, immunity, DNA repair, and oncogenic signaling, we identified three AML subtypes: DNA repair (DR), immune-enriched (ImE), and immune-deprived (ImD), consistent in four independent datasets. DR is marked by high expression of DNA repair and metabolic pathways, high stemness and proliferation potential, as well as high sensitivity to chemotherapy. ImD is characterized by low expression of immune and oncogenic pathways, favorable survival prognosis, low mutation rates of RUNX1 and TP53, high homeostasis, and low migration potential. ImE exhibits high enrichment of immune and oncogenic pathways, low stemness and proliferation capacity, low homeostasis, high migration potential, and low sensitivity to chemotherapy. Our pathway enrichment-based subtyping approach would offer a promising framework for understanding the molecular heterogeneity of AML and guiding personalized treatment of this disease.">

        <tr id="Neuroblastoma is characterised by significant intratumoural heterogeneity which complicates treatments. Phenotypic adaptation, i.e., the ability of cells to alter their phenotype without genetic mutations, is a key factor contributing to this heterogeneity. In this study, we quantify cell actions and cell-to-cell interactions that lead to phenotypic adaptation in vitro under stress. We first record dynamic cell counts in low-nutrient conditions for two cell lines: IMR-32 and SK-N-BE(2). We next formulate a list of permissible biological processes that might occur in the regarded systems and, from the list, construct candidate models via mass action kinetics. To quantitatively infer processes that lead to phenotypic adaptation, we perform a model selection based on computational Bayesian inference methods using the probabilistic programming language Stan. Our results suggest that cell-to-cell interactions promote phenotypic adaptation and that the rate of phenotypic adaptation increases with decreasing nutrient concentrations. We then perform flowcytometry assays to confirm the change in phenotype in the two models and show that the switch occurs as a function of initial condition.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT ALK fusions, such as the classic EML4‐ALK, are known drivers of lung cancer and effective therapeutic targets. However, variant ALK fusions, including intergenic fusions like LOC388942‐ALK (LA), have been detected in increasing numbers of patients, with their roles in tumorigenesis and ALK inhibitor resistance remaining unclear. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated the LA fusion in A549 and H441 cells, confirming elevated ALK expression via qRT‐PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Functional analyses showed that LA significantly promoted tumor growth in vitro and in vivo while conferring increased resistance to alectinib. RNA‐seq revealed upregulation of the FOS pathway in LA tumors, identifying FOS as a potential therapeutic target. Subsequently, we demonstrated that FOS disruption and inhibition sensitized LA tumors to treatment. RNA‐seq profiling demonstrated that FOS depletion in LOC388942‐ALK tumor significantly downregulated multiple oncogenic pathways related to cell cycle progression, DNA replication fidelity, and extracellular matrix remodeling, suggesting a pivotal role of FOS in maintaining tumor growth. These findings establish LOC388942‐ALK as a novel oncogenic driver in lung cancer, highlighting its role in tumor growth and ALK inhibitor resistance. Targeting FOS may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors harboring this intergenic fusion.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and highly lethal type of primary brain tumor in adults. Therapeutic failure is partly attributed to a fraction of Glioblastoma Stem Cells (GSCs) that show high levels of heterogeneity and plasticity. GSCs exist in a transcriptional gradient between two states: Developmental (Dev) and Injury Response (IR) in which IR-GSCs exhibit more invasive behaviors. While previous studies have identified fitness genes in GSCs, the genes required to establish and maintain the Dev and IR states remain poorly defined. To identify the regulators of the IR GSC state, we performed a phenotypic genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) screen in patient-derived GSCs based on cell surface expression of the IR marker CD44. Notably, we found that perturbations of the histone acetyltransferase EP300 in IR GSCs led to decreased CD44 cell surface expression, significant downregulation of gene expression signatures associated with the IR state, and to decreased self-renewal and invasion. Furthermore, genetic targeting of Ep300 in a mouse GBM model delayed tumor initiation and/or progression. Collectively, our results establish EP300 as a regulator of the IR state in GSCs and provide a mechanistic basis for its therapeutic targeting in GBM. Significance A genome-wide phenotypic CRISPR-Cas9 screen in a patient-derived Glioblastoma Stem Cell line identified the genes required to maintain the Injury-Response cellular state, with a focus on the histone acetyl transferase gene EP300. This study suggests how therapeutic targeting of cellular state could reduce the aggressiveness of GBM tumors.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment landscape across multiple cancer types achieving durable responses for a significant number of patients. Despite their success, many patients still fail to respond to ICIs or develop resistance soon after treatment. We sought to identify early treatment features associated with ICI outcome. We leveraged the MC38 syngeneic tumor model because it has variable response to ICI therapy driven by tumor intrinsic heterogeneity. ICI response was assessed based on the level of immune cell infiltration into the tumor – a well-established clinical hallmark of ICI response. We generated a spatial atlas of 48,636 transcriptome-wide spots across 16 tumors using spatial transcriptomics; given the tumors were difficult to profile, we developed an enhanced transcriptome capture protocol yielding high quality spatial data. In total, we identified 8 tumor cell subsets (e.g., proliferative, inflamed, and vascularized) and 4 stroma subsets (e.g., immune and fibroblast). Each tumor had orthogonal histology and bulk-RNA sequencing data, which served to validate and benchmark observations from the spatial data. Our spatial atlas revealed that increased tumor cell cholesterol regulation, synthesis, and transport were associated with a lack of ICI response. Conversely, inflammation and T cell infiltration were associated with response. We further leveraged spatially aware gene expression analysis, to demonstrate that high cholesterol synthesis by tumor cells was associated with cytotoxic CD8 T cell exclusion. Finally, we demonstrate that bulk RNA-sequencing was able to detect immune correlates of response but lacked the sensitivity to detect cholesterol synthesis as a feature of resistance.">

        <tr id="Radiotherapy is a cornerstone of colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment; however, its therapeutic efficacy is often compromised by both intrinsic and acquired resistance in CRC cells. This study employed small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology to elucidate the functional roles of BAMBI, GADD34, NFKBIA, and NFKBID in CRC cell lines SW480 and HCT116. We assessed their impact on key cellular processes and radiation sensitivity. Gene silencing of all four target genes significantly suppressed CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown enhanced radiation sensitivity, as evidenced by a substantial increase in apoptosis and a marked reduction in cell viability compared with controls. These findings suggest that BAMBI, GADD34, NFKBIA, and NFKBID serve as critical regulators of CRC progression and radiation resistance. Overall, this study provides a mechanistic foundation for further exploration into the pathways underlying radiation resistance and underscores the potential for developing personalized radiotherapy strategies guided by molecular profiling.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Genetic testing and sequencing technologies offer a comprehensive understanding of cancer genetics, providing rapid and cost‐effective solutions. In particular, these advanced technologies play an important role in assessing the complexities of the rare cancer types affecting several systems including the bone, endocrine, digestive, vascular, and soft tissue. This review will explore how genetic testing and sequencing technologies have contributed to the identification of biomarkers across several rare cancer types in diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic stages, thereby advancing PM. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and Web of Science using keywords related to sequencing technologies, genetic testing, and cancer. There were no restrictions on language, methodology, age, or publication date. Both primary and secondary research involving humans or animals were considered. Results In practice, fluorescence in situ hybridization, karyotype, microarrays and other genetic tests are mainly applied to identify specific genetic alterations and mutations associated with cancer progression. Sequencing technologies, such as next generation sequencing, polymerase chain reaction, whole genome or exome sequencing, enable the rapid analysis of millions of DNA fragments. These techniques assess genome structure, genetic changes, gene expression profiles, and epigenetic variations. Consequently, they help detect main intrinsic markers that are crucial for personalizing diagnosis, treatment options, and prognostic assessments, leading to better patient prognosis. This highlights why these methods are now considered as primary tools in rare cancer research. However, these methods still face multiple limitations, including false positive results, limited precision, and high costs. Conclusion Genetic testing and sequencing technologies have significantly advanced the field of rare cancer research by enabling the identification of key biomarkers for precision diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Despite existing limitations, their integration into clinical and research fields continues to improve the development of personalized medicine strategies for rare and complex cancer types.">

        <tr id="Hepatocytes are crucial for drug screening, disease modeling, and clinical transplantation, yet generating functional hepatocytes in vitro is challenging due to the difficulty of establishing their authentic gene regulatory networks (GRNs). We have previously developed a two-step lineage reprogramming strategy to generate functionally competent human induced hepatocytes (hiHeps), providing an effective model for studying the establishment of hepatocyte-specific GRNs. In this study, we utilized high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to explore the cell-fate transition and the establishment of hepatocyte-specific GRNs involved in the two-step reprogramming process. Our findings revealed that the late stage of the reprogramming process mimics the natural trajectory of liver development, exhibiting similar transcriptional waves of developmental genes. CD24 and DLK1 were identified as surface markers enriching two distinct hepatic progenitor populations respectively. Lipid metabolism emerged as a key enhancer of hiHeps maturation. Furthermore, transcription factors HNF4A and HHEX were identified as pivotal gatekeepers directing cell fate decisions between hepatocytes and intestinal cells. Collectively, this study provides valuable insights into the establishment of hepatocyte-specific GRNs during hiHeps induction at single-cell resolution, facilitating more efficient production of functional hepatocytes for therapeutic applications.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The transcription factor p53 is the most frequently impaired tumor suppressor in human cancers. In response to various stress stimuli, p53 activates transcription of genes that mediate its tumor-suppressive functions. Distinctive characteristics of p53 outlined here enable a well-defined program of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, differentiation, metabolism, autophagy, DNA repair, anti-viral response, and anti-metastatic functions, as well as facilitating autoregulation within the p53 network. This versatile, anti-cancer network governed chiefly by a single protein represents an immense opportunity for targeted cancer treatment, since about half of human tumors retain unmutated p53. During the last two decades, numerous compounds have been developed to block the interaction of p53 with the main negative regulator MDM2. However, small molecule inhibitors of MDM2 only induce a therapeutically desirable apoptotic response in a limited number of cancer types. Moreover, clinical trials of the MDM2 inhibitors as monotherapies have not met expectations and have revealed hematological toxicity as a characteristic adverse effect across this drug class. Currently, combination treatments are the leading strategy for enhancing efficacy and reducing adverse effects of MDM2 inhibitors. This review summarizes efforts to identify and test therapeutics that work synergistically with MDM2 inhibitors. Two main types of drugs have emerged among compounds used in the following combination treatments: first, modulators of the p53-regulated transcriptome (including chromatin modifiers), translatome, and proteome, and second, drugs targeting the downstream pathways such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, metabolic stress response, immune response, ferroptosis, and growth factor signaling. Here, we review the current literature in this field, while also highlighting overarching principles that could guide target selection in future combination treatments.">

        <tr id="Despite extensive research, the gene regulatory architecture governing mammalian cell states remains poorly understood. Here we present an integrative systems biology approach to elucidate the network architecture of primed state pluripotency. Using an unbiased methodology, we identified and experimentally confirmed 132 transcription factors as master regulators (MRs) of mouse epiblast stem cell (EpiSC) pluripotency, many of which were further validated by CRISPR-mediated functional assays. To assemble a comprehensive regulatory network, we silenced each of the 132 MRs to assess their effects on the other MRs and their transcriptional targets, yielding a network of 1273 MR → MR interactions. Network architecture analyses revealed four functionally distinct MR modules (communities), and identified key Speaker and Mediator MRs based on their hierarchical rank and centrality. Our findings elucidate the de-centralized logic of a “communal interaction” model in which the balanced activities of four MR communities maintain primed state pluripotency.">

        <tr id="Background: The cell cycle, a critical and intricate biological process, comprises various phases, and its dysregulation plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis and metastasis. The exploration of cell cycle-based molecular subtypes across pan-cancers, along with the application of synthetic lethality concepts, holds promise for advancing cancer therapies. Methods: A pan-cancer analysis was conducted to assess the cell cycle serves as a reliable signature for classifying molecular subtypes and to understand the potential clinical application of genes as potential drug targets based on synthetic lethality. Results: Molecular subtypes derived from cell cycle features in certain cancers, particularly kidney-related malignancies, exhibited distinct immune characteristics. Synthetic lethal interactions within the cell cycle pathway were common, with significant genetic interactions further identifying potential drug targets through the exploitation of genetic relationships with key driver genes. Additionally, miRNAs and lncRNAs may influence the cell cycle through miRNA:mRNA interactions and ceRNA networks, thereby enriching the genetic interaction landscape. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the cell cycle pathway could serve as a promising molecular subtype signature to enhance cancer prognostication and offer potential targets for anticancer drug development through synthetic lethality.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cancer arises as an abnormality in genomic control, either due to the activation of oncogenes or loss of functioning tumor-suppressor genes. Oncogenes result in an uncontrolled increase in cell proliferation; tumor-suppressor genes act as a brake, leading the cell cycle to stop and promote cell death when necessary. This review seeks to tease out the complex interactions between these genes, throwing light on key signaling pathways such as MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and Wnt/β-catenin, all of which play a role in the progression of the tumor. We discuss major genetic theories, especially Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis, and how modern technologies like next-generation sequencing have advanced our understanding of cancer genetics. We also underscore the most current therapeutic approaches involving oncogenes and the reactivation of tumor-suppressor gene function, with challenges including drug resistance and heterogeneity of the tumor. In this regard, understanding the balance between oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes is critical in developing effective and personalized cancer treatment, thereby bettering patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Gene network models provide a foundation for graph theory approaches, aiding in the novel discovery of drug targets, disease genes, and genetic mechanisms for various biological functions. Disease genetics must be interpreted within the cellular context of disease-associated cell types, which cannot be achieved with datasets consisting solely of organism-level samples. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows computational distinction of cell states which provides a unique opportunity to understand cellular biology that drives disease processes. Importantly, the abundance of cell samples with their transcriptome-wide profile allows the modeling of systemic cell-type-specific gene networks (CGNs), offering insights into gene-cell-disease relationships. In this review, we present reference-based and de novo inference of gene functional interaction networks that we have recently developed using scRNA-seq datasets. We also introduce a compendium of CGNs as a useful resource for cell-type-resolved disease genetics. By leveraging these advances, we envision single-cell network biology as the key approach for mapping the gene-cell-disease axis.">

        <tr id="Reprogramming T cell metabolism can improve intratumoural fitness. By performing a CRISPR/Cas9 metabolic survey in CD8+ T cells, we identified 83 targets and we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to disclose transcriptome changes associated with each metabolic perturbation in the context of pancreatic cancer. This revealed elongation of very long-chain fatty acids protein 1 (Elovl1) as a metabolic target to sustain effector functions and memory phenotypes in CD8+ T cells. Accordingly, Elovl1 inactivation in adoptively transferred T cells combined with anti-PD-1 showed therapeutic efficacy in resistant pancreatic and melanoma tumours. The accumulation of saturated long-chain fatty acids in Elovl1-deficient T cells destabilized INSIG1, leading to SREBP2 activation, increased plasma membrane cholesterol and stronger T cell receptor signalling. Elovl1-deficient T cells increased mitochondrial fitness and fatty acid oxidation, thus withstanding the metabolic stress imposed by the tumour microenvironment. Finally, ELOVL1 in CD8+ T cells correlated with anti-PD-1 response in patients with melanoma. Altogether, Elovl1 targeting synergizes with anti-PD-1 to promote effective T cell responses.">

        <tr id="Background The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase phosphorylates and activates several downstream targets that are essential for DNA damage repair, cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis. Germline biallelic inactivation of the ATM gene causes ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), and heterozygous pathogenic variant (PV) carriers are at increased risk of cancer, notably breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate whether DNA methylation profiling can be useful as a biomarker to identify tumors arising in ATM PV carriers, which may help for the management and optimal tailoring of therapies of these patients. Methods Breast tumor enriched DNA was prepared from 2 A-T patients, 27 patients carrying an ATM PV, 6 patients carrying a variant of uncertain clinical significance and 484 noncarriers enrolled in epidemiological studies conducted in France and Australia to investigate genetic and nongenetic factors involved in breast cancer susceptibility. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation EPIC and 450K BeadChips. Correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression was assessed for 10 tumors for which transcriptomic data were available. Results We found that the ATM promoter was hypermethylated in 62% of tumors of heterozygous PV carriers compared to the mean methylation level of ATM promoter in tumors of noncarriers. Gene set enrichment analyses identified 47 biological pathways enriched in hypermethylated genes involved in neoplastic, neurodegenerative and metabolic-related pathways in tumor of PV carriers. Among the 327 differentially methylated promoters, promoters of ARHGAP40, SCGB3A1 (HIN-1), and CYBRD1 (DCYTB) were hypermethylated and associated with a lower gene expression in these tumors. Moreover, using three different deep learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest and XGBoost), we identified a set of 27 additional biomarkers predictive of ATM status, which could be used in the future to provide evidence for or against pathogenicity in ATM variant classification strategies. Conclusions We showed that breast tumors that arise in women who carry an ATM PV display a specific genome-wide DNA methylation profile. Specifically, the methylation pattern of 27 key gene promoters was predictive of ATM PV status of the women. These genes may also represent new medical prevention and therapeutic targets for these women.

        <tr id="It is well established that hematologic malignancies are often considerably radiosensitive, which enables usage of far lower doses of therapeutic radiotherapy. This review summarizes the currently known genomic landscape of hematologic malignancies, particularly as it relates to radiosensitivity and the field of radiation oncology. By tracing the historical development of the modern understanding of radiosensitivity, we focus on the discovery and implications of pivotal mutated genes in hematologic malignancies such as TP53, ATM, and other genes critical to DNA repair pathways. These genetic insights have contributed significantly to the advancement of personalized medicine, aiming to enhance treatment precision and outcomes, and there is an opportunity to extend these insights to personalized radiotherapy. We explore the transition from early discoveries to the current efforts in integrating comprehensive genomic data into clinical practice. Specific examples from Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and plasma cell neoplasms illustrate how genetic mutations could influence radiosensitivity and impact subsequent radiotherapeutic response. Despite the advancements, challenges remain in translating these genetic insights into routine clinical practice, particularly due to the heterogeneity of alterations and the complex interactions within cancer signaling pathways. We emphasize the potential of radiogenomics to address these challenges by identifying genetic markers that predict radiotherapy response and toxicity, thereby refining treatment strategies. The need for robust decision support systems, standardized protocols, and ongoing education for healthcare providers is critical to the successful integration of genomic data into radiation therapy. As research continues to validate genetic markers and explore novel therapeutic combinations, the promise of personalized radiotherapy becomes increasingly attainable, offering the potential to significantly improve outcomes for patients with hematologic malignancies.">

        <tr id="EGFR is a proto-oncogene that is mutationally activated in a variety of cancers. Small molecule inhibitors targeting EGFR can be effective in slowing the progression of disease, and in some settings these drugs even cause dramatic tumor regression. However, responses to EGFR inhibitors are rarely durable, and the mechanisms contributing to response variation remain unclear. In particular, several distinct mechanisms have been proposed for how EGFR inhibition activates cell death, and a consensus has yet to emerge. In this study, we use functional genomics with specialized analyses to infer how genetic perturbations effect the drug-induced death rate. Our data clarify that inhibition of PI3K signaling drives the lethality of EGFR inhibition. Inhibition of other pathways downstream of EGFR, including the RAS-MAPK pathway, promote growth suppression, but not the lethal effects of EGFR inhibitors. Taken together, our study reveals the first “reference map” for the genome-wide genetic dependencies of lethality for EGFR inhibitors.">

        <tr id="To maintain cell fitness, deleterious genetic alterations are buffered by compensatory changes in additional genes. In cancer, buffering processes could be targeted by synthetic lethality. However, despite the large-scale identification of synthetic lethal effects in preclinical models, evidence that these operate clinically is limited. This impedes the application of synthetic lethal approaches. By integrating molecular profiling data from >9,000 cancers with synthetic lethal screens, we show that transcriptomic buffering of tumor suppressor gene (TSG) loss by hyperexpression of synthetic lethal partners is a common phenomenon, extending to multiple TSGs and histotypes. Transcriptomic buffering is also notable in cancers that phenocopy TSG loss, such as BRCAness cancers, where expression of BRCA1/2 synthetic lethal genes correlates with clinical outcome. Synthetic lethal genes that exhibit transcriptomic buffering also represent more robust synthetic lethal effects. These observations have implications for understanding how tumor cells tolerate TSG loss, in part explain transcriptomic architectures in cancer and provide insight into target selection.">

        <tr id="Somatic mobilization of LINE-1 (L1) has been implicated in cancer etiology. We analyzed a recent TCGA data release comprised of nearly 5000 pan-cancer paired tumor-normal whole-genome sequencing (WGS) samples and ~9000 tumor RNA samples. We developed TotalReCall an improved algorithm and pipeline for detection of L1 retrotransposition (RT), finding high correlation between L1 expression and “RT burden” per sample. Furthermore, we mathematically model the dual regulatory roles of p53, where mutations in TP53 disrupt regulation of both L1 expression and retrotransposition. We found those with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) heritable TP53 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants bear similarly high L1 activity compared to matched cancers from patients without LFS, suggesting this population be considered in attempts to target L1 therapeutically. Due to improved sensitivity, we detect over 10 genes beyond TP53 whose mutations correlate with L1, including ATRX, suggesting other, potentially targetable, mechanisms underlying L1 regulation in cancer remain to be discovered.">

        <tr id="Background Recent research has identified a potential protective effect of higher numbers of circulating lymphocytes on colorectal cancer (CRC) development. However, the importance of different lymphocyte subtypes and activation states in CRC development and the biological pathways driving this relationship remain poorly understood and warrant further investigation. Specifically, CD4+ T cells -- a highly dynamic lymphocyte subtype -- undergo remodelling upon activation to induce the expression of genes critical for their effector function. Previous studies investigating their role in CRC risk have used bulk tissue, limiting our current understanding of the role of these cells to static, non-dynamic relationships only. Methods Here, we combined two genetic epidemiological methods -- Mendelian randomisation (MR) and genetic colocalisation -- to evaluate evidence for causal relationships of gene expression on CRC risk across multiple CD4+ T cell subtypes and activation stage. Genetic proxies were obtained from single-cell transcriptomic data, allowing us to investigate the causal effect of expression of 1,805 genes across five CD4+ T cell activation states on CRC risk (78,473 cases; 107,143 controls). We repeated analyses stratified by CRC anatomical subsites and sex, and performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate whether the observed effect estimates were likely to be CD4+ T cell-specific. Results We identified six genes with evidence (FDR-P<0.05 in MR analyses and H4>0.8 in genetic colocalisation analyses) for a causal role of CD4+ T cell expression in CRC development -- FADS2, FHL3, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB5, RPL28, and TMEM258 . We observed differences in causal estimates of gene expression on CRC risk across different CD4+ T cell subtypes and activation timepoints, as well as CRC anatomical subsites and sex. However, our sensitivity analysis revealed that the genetic proxies used to instrument gene expression in CD4+ T cells also act as eQTLs in other tissues, highlighting the challenges of using genetic proxies to instrument tissue-specific expression changes. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the importance of capturing the dynamic nature of CD4+ T cells in understanding disease risk, and prioritises genes for further investigation in cancer prevention research.">

        <tr id="Background Understanding the intricate tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the progression of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and its response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Methods In this study, we characterized 50,649 cells obtained from the CSCC for single-cell RNA sequencing and integrated bulk sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and clinical samples to explore their cell composition, metabolic processes, signaling pathways, specific transcription factors, lineage tracking and response to immunotherapy. In vivo experiments were performed to validate the function of key cell subsets. Results We identified ten major cell type and 35 subsets of stromal and immune cells in TME and observed distinct patterns in the metabolic processes and signaling pathways of these cells between tumor and normal tissues. Furthermore, PCNA clamp-associated factor (PCLAF)+ tumor-associated epithelial cell (TAEpis) was negatively correlated with the number of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13)+ CD8+ T cells, overall survival, and response to anti-programmed cell death-1(PD-1) therapy in patients with CSCC. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that PCLAF+ TAEpis promotes the apoptosis of CD8+ T and tumor growth, while also inhibiting T cell infiltration and function. Conclusion Our findings illuminate the heterogeneity of the complex TME in CSCC and offer evidence supporting PCLAF+ TAEpis as a promising therapeutic target.

Its expression strongly correlates with clinicopathological features, patient survival, and disease progression. In vivo and in vitro experiments further demonstrate that LINC01123 influences diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, viability, migration, invasion, stemness, and tumor growth. Notably, it also regulates metabolic reprogramming, immune escape, and tumor cell resistance to treatment. LINC01123 is regulated by multiple transcription factors and participates in gene regulation through protein interactions and competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks, thereby modulating cancer-promoting effects. This work systematically elucidates its primary functions and molecular mechanisms driving cancer initiation and progression, suggesting that LINC01123 might serve as a novel potential oncogenic driver and biomarker in various cancers.">

        <tr id="Whole genome doubling (WGD) is a frequent event in cancer evolution associated with chromosomal instability, metastasis, and poor prognosis. While the genomic consequences of WGD are well documented, the effects of non-genetic alterations that accompany WGD, such as changes to cell and nuclear size, on tetraploid (4N) cancer cell physiology are less understood. Here, we show that cell and nuclear volume do not always scale with DNA content after WGD in cancer cells, resulting in 4N cells that differ in size. We find that small size is associated with enhanced cell fitness, mitotic fidelity, and tumorigenicity in 4N cancer cells and with poor patient survival in WGD-positive human cancers. Overall, these results suggest that cell and nuclear size contribute to the tumorigenic potential of 4N cancer cells and could be an important prognostic marker in human tumors that undergo WGD. Statement of Significance We report that WGD generates tetraploid cancer cells that vary in size, with larger cells displaying high chromosomal instability and smaller cells exhibiting high fitness and tumorigenicity. Furthermore, WGD status and cancer cell nuclear size in human tumors correlated with patient survival, demonstrating the clinical relevance of this association.">

        <tr id="Introduction Unique from the other tumor cells, tumorigenic cancer stem cells (CSCs) manifest as a subpopulation of cells within the tumor that exhibit genetic and phenotypic features and signaling processes, which escape traditional anti-oncogenic treatments, thereby triggering metastases and relapses of cancers. Critical to cancer biology is the crosstalk between CSCs and tumor microenvironment (TME), implicating a CSC-based cancer immunotherapy. Cognizant of CSCs’ significant role in cancer pathology and treatment, finding a biological model that recapitulates CSCs and TME may allow a better understanding of tumor onset and progression for testing CSC-based therapies. In this review paper, we examined the CSC and TME characteristics of the human embryonal carcinoma NTERA-2 clonal cell line called NTERA-2 cl.D1 or NT2/D1 cells and discussed their potential utility for research and development of treatments for cancer and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Methods To probe our hypotheses that NT2/D1 cells display CSC and TME properties key to tumor development, which can serve as a screening platform to test cancer and CNS therapeutics, we conducted a literature review over a 10-year period (2014–2024), focusing on PUBMED and Science Direct published articles on cellular models of cancer, with emphasis on milestone research discoveries on NT2/D1 cells relevant to CSCs and TME. We categorized the studies under pre-clinical and clinical investigations in supporting the existence of CSC and TME features in NT2/D1 cells and providing a laboratory-to-clinic translational basis for cancer and CNS therapeutics. Conclusions NT2/D1 cells stand as a feasible biological model that recapitulates the crosstalk of CSCs and TME, which may critically contribute to our understanding of cancer and CNS biology and therapeutics. Designing therapeutics against CSCs' distinct self-renewal and differentiation capacities within the TME opens new avenues for treating cancers and CNS disorders. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="Genetic diseases are serious health issues worldwide, caused by changes in gene structure due to mutations in single or multiple genes. Currently, no definitive treatments or medicines are available to cure these disorders. Gene therapy, a medical approach that utilizes genetic material, offers potential for preventing and treating diseases by addressing their underlying causes rather than relying on traditional methods like medication and surgery. This technique has shown promise in certain conditions by altering genetic material, enabling the body to produce desirable proteins or medications. However, gene therapy remains unavailable for most diseases and is still largely in the experimental stage for many conditions. This review investigates the current and future status of gene therapy not only for genetic disorders but also for life-threatening diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes. Additionally, the applications and limitations of gene therapy were evaluated. A review of recent research concluded that while rare or inherited genetic disorders could potentially be prevented or cured by precisely targeting their root causes, significant challenges remain. Rather than solely managing blood disorders, retinal diseases, and neuromuscular conditions, gene therapy can potentially eliminate these conditions. Furthermore, gene-based therapies offer expansive possibilities beyond rare genetic disorders, paving the way for broader therapeutic applications in the future.">

        <tr id="Background Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody–drug conjugate that is an effective therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer; however, its efficacy is limited by drug resistance. While multiple mechanisms of resistance have been proposed, these are not yet well understood. Greater understanding of T-DM1 sensitivity and resistance could provide new combination strategies to overcome resistance or predictive biomarkers to guide therapy. Methods We have conducted CRISPR/Cas9 functional genomics modifier screens in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines to allow for unbiased discovery of T-DM1 sensitivity and resistance genes. Whole-genome knockout screens were carried out in MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453 cells treated with T-DM1 and its payload cytotoxin DM1. Hits were validated in secondary T-DM1 screens using a focused single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library and subsequently by individual gene knockout. Results The whole-genome CRISPR screens with T-DM1 and DM1 identified 599 genes as potential modifiers of T-DM1 sensitivity and resistance. Of these, 17 genes were significantly enriched and 3 genes depleted at P < 0.001 in either or both MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453 libraries in the secondary screens. Among the top hits, were known T-DM1 sensitivity genes ERBB2 and SLC46A3, in addition to negative regulators of mTOR complex 1: TSC1 and TSC2. MDA-MB-453 clones with knockout of TSC1 or partial knockout of TSC2 were more resistant to T-DM1 than wild type cells in competition growth assays and to T-DM1 and other HER2 targeting therapies (T-DXd, lapatinib and neratinib) in growth inhibition assays, and had increased internalisation of T-DM1 at 6 h. T-DM1 and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus demonstrated synergistic activity at inhibiting cell proliferation at multiple T-DM1 concentrations across four HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines. Conclusions Our CRISPR screening approach with T-DM1 in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines identified genes not previously implicated in T-DM1 sensitivity or resistance, including TSC1 and TSC2. These genes may inform new strategies to enhance T-DM1 therapy in the clinic. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13058-025-02000-1.">

        <tr id="Epigenetic regulation plays an important role in cell fate reprogramming. Here, we found that inhibitors of epigenetic modifiers, including VPA, TSA, and 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, can induce phenotypic transformation from Jurkat cells into B-cell-like cells. When Jurkat cells were treated with 5-Aza combined with VPA, B cell and stem cell marker expression was observed. These gene expression pattern changes were most remarkable in the optimized B cell induction conditions provided by the cocultured and genetically modified murine bone marrow OP9 cells. In such conditions, Jurkat cells were endowed with the ability to secrete B cell cytokines, and B lymphocyte-related genes and pathways were activated. In studying the mechanism underlying Jurkat cell reprogramming by 5-Aza and VPA, we found that PAX5, the key transcription factor regulating B cell development, was significantly upregulated. Treatment with 5-Aza and VPA inhibited the methylation of CpG islands and upregulated the acetylated H3K9 modification in the PAX5 promoter region, respectively, thus epigenetically activating the expression of PAX5 and promoting the reprogramming of Jurkat cells. Similar reprogramming results were also observed in primary CD4+T cells following treatment with 5-Aza and VPA. Our results provide a de novo paradigm for the reprogramming of T cells through epigenetic modifications.">

        <tr id="Oncogenic gene fusions occur across a broad range of cancers and are a defining feature of some cancer types. Cancers driven by gene fusion products tend to respond well to targeted therapies, where available; thus, detection of potentially targetable oncogenic fusions is necessary to select optimal treatment. Detection methods include non-sequencing methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, and sequencing methods, such as DNA- and RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS). While NGS is an efficient way to analyze multiple genes of interest at once, economic and technical factors may preclude its use in routine care globally, despite several guideline recommendations. The aim of this review is to present a summary of oncogenic gene fusions, with a focus on fusions that affect tyrosine kinase signaling, and to highlight the importance of testing for oncogenic fusions. We present an overview of the identification of oncogenic gene fusions and therapies approved for the treatment of cancers harboring gene fusions, and summarize data regarding treating fusion-positive cancers with no current targeted therapies and clinical studies of fusion-positive cancers. Although treatment options may be limited for patients with rare alterations, healthcare professionals should identify patients most likely to benefit from oncogenic gene fusion testing and initiate the appropriate targeted therapy to achieve optimal treatment outcomes.">

        <tr id="Adaptation is a fundamental tenet of evolutionary biology and is essential for the survival of all organisms, including prokaryotes. The evolution of clustered regularity exemplifies this principle of interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and associated proteins (Cas), an adaptive immune system that confers resistance to viral infections. By integrating short segments of viral genomes into their own, bacteria and archaea develop a molecular memory that enables them to mount a rapid and targeted response upon subsequent viral challenges. The fortuitous discovery of this immune mechanism prompted many studies and introduced researchers to novel tools that could potentially be developed from CRISPR-Cas and become clinically relevant as biotechnology rapidly advances in this area. Thus, a deeper understanding of the underpinnings of CRISPR-Cas and its possible therapeutic applications is required. This review analyses the mechanism of action of the CRISPR-Cas systems in detail and summarises the advances in developing biotechnological tools based on CRISPR, opening the field for further research.">

        <tr id="Lynch-like syndrome (LLS) presents very similar clinicopathological characteristics to Lynch syndrome (LS) but the mechanism for cancer predisposition remains unknown. The present study aims to investigate the causal mechanism of LLS by a comprehensive genetic and epigenetic approach. Thirty-two LLS and 34 LS patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) fitting the Amsterdam and Bethesda criteria were included, along with 29 CRC sporadic patients, and analyzed for the presence of pathogenic variants in 94 genes associated with hereditary tumors. The cohorts were also characterized for the methylation profile and examined through a sample group analysis and a Stochastic Epigenetic Mutations (SEMs) analysis in comparison with 29 age-matched healthy controls. The multigene panel analysis revealed the presence of pathogenic variants in non-mismatch repair (MMR) genes and three variants classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic possibly predisposing to LLS. The epigenetic analysis showed epivariations targeting genes associated with LS or DNA repair, most of them associated with the Fanconi Anemia pathway, which could explain the susceptibility to cancer. Our results highlight the need for using extended genetic and epigenetic analyses to understand the causal mechanism of LLS.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Gene fusions represent important oncogenic driver mutations resulting in aberrant cellular signaling. In up to 17% of all solid tumors at least one gene fusion can be identified. Precision therapy targeting fusion gene signaling has demonstrated effective clinical benefit. Advancements in clinically relevant next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic techniques have enabled expansion of therapeutic opportunity to subpopulations of patients with fusion gene expression. Clinically, tyrosine inhibitors have shown efficacy in treating fusion gene expressing cancers. Fusion genes are also clonal mutations, meaning it is a personal cancer target involving all cancer cells of that patient, not just a subpopulation of cancer cells within the cancer mass. Thus, both fusion signal disruption and immune signal targeting are effective therapeutic directions. This review discusses fusion gene targeting, therapeutic resistance, and molecular biomarkers.">

        <tr id="The tumour microenvironment is composed of a complex cellular network involving cancer, stromal and immune cells in dynamic interactions. A large proportion of this network relies on direct physical interactions between cells, which may impact patient responses to clinical therapy. Doublets in scRNA-seq are usually excluded from analysis. However, they may represent directly interacting cells. To decipher the physical interaction landscape in relation to clinical prognosis, we inferred a physical cell–cell interaction (PCI) network from ‘biological’ doublets in a scRNA-seq dataset of approximately 18,000 cells, obtained from 7 treatment-naive ovarian cancer patients. Focusing on cancer-stromal PCIs, we uncovered molecular interaction networks and transcriptional landscapes that stratified patients in respect to their clinical responses to standard therapy. Good responders featured PCIs involving immune cells interacting with other cell types including cancer cells. Poor responders lacked immune cell interactions, but showed a high enrichment of cancer-stromal PCIs. To explore the molecular differences between cancer-stromal PCIs between responders and non-responders, we identified correlating gene signatures. We constructed ligand-receptor interaction networks and identified associated downstream pathways. The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks and trajectory analysis revealed distinct transcription factor (TF) clusters and gene modules that separated doublet cells by clinical outcomes. Our results indicate (i) that transcriptional changes resulting from PCIs predict the response of ovarian cancer patients to standard therapy, (ii) that immune reactivity of the host against the tumour enhances the efficacy of therapy, and (iii) that cancer-stromal cell interaction can have a dual effect either supporting or inhibiting therapy responses.">

        <tr id="Chromosomal instability (CIN), characterized by pervasive copy number alterations (CNAs), significantly contributes to cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. CNAs drive intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, creating distinct subpopulations whose interactions shape tumor evolution through frequency-dependent selection. Here, we introduce, ECO-K (Ecological-Karyotypes), an inverse game theory framework that infers subpopulation interactions from longitudinal single-cell whole genome sequencing data. Applying this approach to serially-passaged, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), we systematically identified frequency-dependent selection dynamics governed by karyotypic diversity. Notably, in one PDX lineage, we found consistent evidence of karyotypically defined subpopulations acting as interaction hubs, associated specifically with chromosome 1 loss and chromosome 14p gain. Our framework provides testable predictions of intratumoral ecological dynamics, highlighting opportunities to strategically target key subpopulations to disrupt tumor evolution.">

        <tr id="Mutations in the DNA can affect cancer development and progression not only by changing the amino acid chain but also by affecting different regulatory elements such as transcription factors. This study introduces a novel pipeline to identify “mutation blocks” - small genomic areas with high mutation rates that potentially influence transcription factors binding. By analyzing GCB lymphoma patient data, mutations blocks were identified that correlated with gene expression changes and were linked to transcription factor activity. These mutation blocks suggest a selection for mutations that alter gene regulation, contributing to lymphoma development. The analysis identified 56 mutation blocks in germinal center B-cell like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GCB DLBCL) patients’ genomes, affecting genes such as BCL2, MYC, SGK1, and PIM1, and linked to transcription factors including MSC, TCFL5, HOXB7, FOXP3, and ZBTB6. A machine learning model that used gene ontology data suggested further potential transcription factors-gene pairs influencing cancer. These findings highlight the role of synonymous and silent mutations in altering transcription factors binding and gene expression, offering insights into the mechanisms of GCB lymphoma.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Pharmacogenomics is a rapidly evolving field that is crucial in optimizing cancer treatments by tailoring therapies to individual patients’ genetic profiles. This review highlights the impact of key genes, such as CYP2D6, DPYD, and UGT1A1, which influence the metabolism of essential cancer drugs like tamoxifen, fluoropyrimidines, and irinotecan. Variations in these genes can affect drug efficacy or increase the risk of side effects, underscoring the need for genetic testing to guide treatment decisions. Despite its proven benefits, pharmacogenomic testing is not yet widely used. Ongoing research aims to improve the accessibility and cost effectiveness of these tests, especially in regions where testing is limited. In the future, combining pharmacogenomic data with emerging technologies, such as liquid biopsies and gene-editing tools, will improve personalized cancer therapies, leading to better treatment outcomes and fewer side effects for patients.">

        <tr id="Background: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a prevalent and aggressive subtype of kidney cancer, often associated with metastasis and recurrence. Identifying key genes involved in ccRCC progression is critical for improving treatment strategies and patient outcomes. Methods: We performed a large-scale genome-wide CRISPR screening to identify genes crucial to ccRCC progression using the DepMap database. For discovery and validation, we integrated multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), GEO, and the NJMU-ccRCC clinical cohort. Bioinformatics analyses, including differential expression, pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network analysis, were conducted to elucidate the biological functions. To validate our findings, we employed immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and various cellular assays to investigate the role of PRC1 in ccRCC. Results: CRISPR screening identified PRC1 as a key gene significantly overexpressed in ccRCC tissues from the DepMap database. Elevated PRC1 expression was associated with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval. Silencing PRC1 in ccRCC cell lines inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that PRC1 is involved in essential processes such as cell cycle regulation, mitosis, and cytokinesis. Additionally, PRC1 expression was correlated with the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, suggesting that PRC1 plays a pivotal role in tumor progression. Conclusion: PRC1 emerges as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for ccRCC. Elevated PRC1 expression is associated with poor prognosis, and its inhibition suppresses ccRCC cell proliferation and migration. Our findings underscore the crucial role of PRC1 in ccRCC progression and highlight the need for further investigation into its molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential.">

Its clinical appearance is varied, and its prognosis is often miserable. Drug resistance to conventional therapies confers significant therapeutic challenges in the management of ATLL. This review discusses the emerging role of epigenetic medical advances in the treatment of ATLL, focusing on DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, histone methyltransferase inhibitors, and BET inhibitors. Indeed, several classes of epigenetic therapies currently exhibit trailed efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies: DNA methyltransferase inhibitors like azacitidine and decitabine reexpression of silenced tumor suppressors; histone deacetylase inhibitors like vorinostat and romidepsin induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis; bromodomain and extra-terminal inhibitors like JQ1 disrupt oncogenic signaling pathways. Whereas preclinical and early clinical data indicate modest to good efficacy for such treatments, significant challenges remain. Here, we discuss the current state of understanding of epigenetic dysregulation in ATLL and appraise the evidence supporting the use of these epi-drugs. However, despite the opened doors of epigenetic treatment, much more research is required with regard to showing the best combinations of drugs and their resistance mechanisms, the minimization of adverse effects, and how this hope will eventually be translated into benefit for the patient with ATLL.">

        <tr id="Tissues and organs develop from single founder cells, which give rise to distinct cell lineages that contribute to regeneration and maintenance of homeostasis in the adult. Tracing the genealogical relationships between individual cells and their gene expression signatures is an important step towards understanding how these processes are regulated in human health and disease. Here, we present mt-SCITE, a computational method for inferring the evolutionary history of dividing cells based on mitochondrial mutations detected in single cells. We show that mt-SCITE outperforms existing methods in accurately estimating the correct mitochondrial mutation tree from simulated data. To validate our method, we applied mt-SCITE on in vitro expanded T-cells profiled with bulk ATAC sequencing, where the clonal relationships were determined independently from T cell receptor sequences. We used our method to reconstruct the division histories and transcriptional heterogeneity of clonally related CD8+ T cells from single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from a healthy human donor. This allowed us to track the in vivo development of CD8+ T cell clones post vaccination and resolve subclonal lineage relationships without the need for genetic barcoding. Our analysis revealed that T cell clones can adopt predominantly memory-like or effector-like states, while some exhibit mixed identities. Taken together, our method represents a novel approach to study cell lineage development in humans.">

        <tr id="Background Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) has potential in tumor diagnosis, particularly for improving diagnostic accuracy and early cancer detection; however, many challenges remain in its application to clinical practice. Methods We conducted a Circle‐Seq analysis on clinical samples at different stages of colorectal cancer progression to examine the dynamic changes of eccDNA during the progression of colorectal cancer. We used breakpoint-specific PCR to verify candidate eccDNAs identified by Circle‐Seq. The results were further validated using the AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer model. Results There was an increase in the abundance of eccDNA with the progression of colorectal cancer. The genes associated with these eccDNA molecules were primarily related to signaling pathways involved in tumor development and metastasis. Our analysis also revealed that eccDNA abundance positively correlates with gene expression, and eccDNA derived from specific genes has potential value for the early diagnosis of tumors. Conclusions This study revealed a connection between eccDNA and colorectal cancer progression and highlights the clinical potential of eccDNA for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

        <tr id="Cellular senescence, a stable state of cell cycle arrest induced by various stressors or genomic damage, is recognized as a hallmark of cancer. It exerts a context-dependent dual role in cancer initiation and progression, functioning as a tumor suppressor and promoter. The complexity of senescence in cancer arises from its mechanistic diversity, potential reversibility, and heterogeneity. A key mediator of these effects is the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a repertoire of bioactive molecules that influence tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling, modulate cancer cell behavior, and contribute to therapeutic resistance. Given its intricate role in cancer biology, senescence presents both challenges and opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Strategies targeting senescence pathways, including senescence-inducing therapies and senolytic approaches, offer promising avenues for cancer treatment. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the regulatory mechanisms governing cellular senescence in tumors. We also discuss emerging strategies to modulate senescence, highlighting novel therapeutic opportunities. A deeper understanding of these processes is essential for developing precision therapies and improving clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="The landscapes of somatic mutation in normal cells inform on the processes of mutation and selection operative throughout life, permitting insight into normal ageing and the earliest stages of cancer development. Here, by whole-genome sequencing of 238 microdissections from 30 individuals, including 18 with gastric cancer, we elucidate the developmental trajectories of normal and malignant gastric epithelium. We find that gastric glands are units of monoclonal cell populations which accrue ∼28 somatic single nucleotide variants per year, predominantly attributable to endogenous mutational processes. In individuals with gastric cancer, glands often show elevated mutation burdens due to acceleration of mutational processes linked to proliferation and oxidative damage. These hypermutant glands were primarily detected in the gastric antrum and were mostly associated with chronic inflammation and intestinal metaplasia, known cancer risk factors. Unusually for normal cells, gastric epithelial cells often carry recurrent trisomies of specific chromosomes, which are highly enriched in a subset of individuals. Surveying approximately 8,000 gastric glands by targeted sequencing, we found somatic driver mutations in a distinctive repertoire of known cancer genes, including ARID1A, CTNNB1, KDM6A and ARID1B. Their prevalence increases with age to occupy approximately 5% of the gastric epithelial lining by age 60 years. Our findings provide insights into the intrinsic and extrinsic influences on somatic evolution in the gastric epithelium, in healthy, precancerous and malignant states.">

        <tr id="Abstract The molecular control of epigenetic information relies on hundreds of proteins of diverse function, which cooperate in defining chromatin structure and DNA methylation landscapes. While many individual pathways have been characterized, how different classes of epigenetic regulators interact to build a resilient epigenetic regulatory network (ERN) remains poorly understood. Here, we show that most individual regulators are dispensable for somatic cell fitness, and that robustness emerges from multiple layers of functional cooperation and degeneracy among network components. By disrupting 200 epigenetic regulator genes, individually or in combination, we generated network-wide maps of functional interactions for representative regulators. We found that paralogues represent only a first layer of functional compensation within the ERN, with intra- or inter-class interactions buffering the effects of perturbation in a gene-specific manner: while CREBBP cooperates with multiple acetyltransferases to form a subnetwork that ensures robust chromatin acetylation, ARID1A interacts with regulators from across all functional classes. When combined with oncogene activation, the accumulated epigenetic disorder exposes a synthetic fragility and broadly sensitizes ARID1A-deficient cells to further perturbation. Our findings reveal homeostatic mechanisms through which the ERN sustains somatic cell fitness and uncover how the network remodels as the epigenome is progressively deregulated in disease.">

        <tr id="Accumulating evidence links pediatric cancers to prenatal transformation events, yet the influence of the developmental stage on oncogenesis remains elusive. We investigated how hematopoietic stem cell developmental stages affect leukemic transformation, disease progression, and therapy response using a novel, humanized model of NUP98::NSD1-driven pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, that is particularly aggressive with WT1 co-mutations. Fetal-derived hematopoietic stem cells readily transform into leukemia, and WT1 mutations further enhance stemness and alter lineage hierarchy. In contrast, stem cells from later developmental stages become progressively resistant to transformation. Single-cell analyses revealed that fetal-origin leukemia stem cells exhibit greater quiescence and reliance on oxidative phosphorylation than their postnatal counterparts. These differences drive distinct therapeutic responses, despite identical oncogenic mutations. In patients, onco-fetal transcriptional programs correlate with worse outcomes. By targeting key vulnerabilities of fetal-origin leukemia cells, we identified combination therapies that significantly reduce aggressiveness, highlighting the critical role of ontogeny in pediatric cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal RNA modification in eukaryotes and plays a key role in cellular growth and development. Global changes in cellular methylated RNA and m6A-mediated transcript regulation significantly impact oncogenesis. Here, we investigate how recurrent synonymous and non-synonymous somatic mutations abolishing individual canonical methylated m6A motifs affect transcript levels and survival of patients with cancer. Moreover, we explore the effect of these mutations on creating de novo m6A motifs. To this end, we compared publicly available data on m6A sites with mutations reported in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We find that mutations disrupting or creating m6A motifs display a low recurrence and have a negligible impact on RNA abundance. Patients with the highest number of disrupted m6A sites or newly generated m6A motifs did not generally exhibit alterations in mortality risk or outcomes. Hence, our data suggest that mutational alterations in the m6A motif landscape are unlikely to be a primary mechanism for regulating gene function across most cancer types. This may be attributed to the fact that mutations typically affect individual m6A sites, which is likely insufficient to significantly impact gene expression.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms regulating transcriptional changes in brain aging remain poorly understood. Here, we use single-cell epigenomics to profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression across eight brain regions in the mouse brain at 2, 9, and 18 months of age. In addition to a significant decline in progenitor cell populations, we observed widespread and concordant changes of transcription and chromatin accessibility during aging in glial and neuronal cell types. These alterations are accompanied by dysregulation of master transcription factors and a shift toward stress-responsive programs, indicating a progressive loss of cell identity with aging. We also identify region- and cell-type-specific heterochromatin decay, characterized by increased accessibility at H3K9me3-marked domains, activation of transposable elements, and upregulation of long non-coding RNAs, particularly in glutamatergic neurons. Together, these results reveal age-related disruption of heterochromatin maintenance and transcriptional programs, identify vulnerable brain regions and cell types, and pinpoint key molecular pathways altered in brain aging. Highlights Single-cell multimodal profiling across eight brain regions reveals coordinated chromatin and transcriptional shifts during aging Age-related depletion of progenitor cells coincides with dysregulation of key lineage specific transcription factors Cell identity maintenance is compromised with the decline of master transcription factors Heterochromatin destabilization accompanied by activation of AP-1, transposable elements, pseudogene families, and long non-coding RNAs">

        <tr id="Tumors exhibit highly heterogeneous genomic and transcriptomic landscapes. Characterization of this intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and its implications for the cancer therapies has been one of the focal points of computational cancer biology in the past years. However, while ITH at the level of genomic changes, such as copy number aberrations, has been well characterized, the downstream impact of ITH on the gene regulatory landscape remains underexplored. Disruptions in gene regulatory programs can lead to emergence of more aggressive or drugresistant tumor clones. In order to better understand whether the evidence for ITH at the gene regulatory level can be inferred from scRNA-seq data we have conducted a series of experiments that explore the levels of gene regulatory network (GRN) discrepancies between the clonal sub-populations of tumor cells. In particular, we quantify the extent to which GRNs inferred from different tumor clones diverge from each other in three settings: triple negative breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and a longitudinal dataset from a patient undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. Our analyses indicate that a substantial (15-25%) proportion of GRN edges can be attributed to clone-specific activity. Furthermore, we observe differential network patterns across outlier transcription factors implicated in tumorogenesis and tumor progression. Our findings suggest that differential network patterns between clonal subpopulations can be reliably identified, and that such patterns offer a complementary insight that is not captured by differential gene analyses.">

        <tr id="Overexpression of the H3K36 histone methyltransferase NSD2 in t(4;14) multiple myeloma (MM) is an early, oncogenic event, and understanding its impact on genomic organisation and expression is relevant to understanding MM biology. We performed epigenetic, transcriptional and phenotypic profiling of the t(4;14) KMS11 myeloma cell line and its isogenic translocation knock out (TKO) to characterise the sequelae of NSD2 overexpression. We found a marked global impact of NSD2 on gene expression and DNA organisation implicating cell identity genes; notably the early lymphocyte regulator, LAIR1 and MM cell surface markers, including CD38, a classical marker of plasma cells which was reduced in TKO cells. Plasma cell transcription factors such as PRDM1, IRF4 and XBP1 were unaffected, suggesting a downstream direct gene effect of NSD2 on cell identity. Changes in cell surface markers suggest an altered surface immunophenotype. Our findings suggest a role for NSD2 in maintaining MM cell identity, with potential implications for future therapeutic strategies based on targeting of NSD2.">

        <tr id="Viruses are a leading cause of human morbidity and mortality. Certain viruses, including human papillomaviruses (HPVs), play a significant role in the etiology of cancer. Detection of viral DNA insertions in the human genome from next generation sequencing data defines viral associations with cancer and other diseases, identifies impacted organs and tissues, provides insights into disease mechanisms and has the potential to enhance clinical evaluations. In this study, we developed VirusIntegrationFinder (CTAT-VIF), a tool for surveying human genome insertions of various human viruses using both DNA and RNA sequencing data. We applied CTAT-VIF to analyze a dataset of over 30,000 tumor and normal samples, as well as more than 1,000 cancer cell lines. This effort resulted in the compilation of a catalog of over 30,0000 virus-human DNA or RNA junctions at more than 20,000 insertion loci and reassessed viral cancer-insertion hotspots across the human genome. Furthermore, we characterized the functional impacts of insertions with respect to human copy number alterations, effects on the expression of flanking human genes, and the identification of potentially oncogenic chimeric human and human/virus fusion transcripts at insertion loci. In addition to confirming known viral associations with specific tumor types, our study revealed both shared and virus-specific insertion hotspots in addition to variable functional impacts based on virus type. Besides some rare events of interest, we also found evidence for sequencing contamination, which underscores the need for vigilance when studying viral content or genome integrations.">

        <tr id="Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is essential for cellular development and differentiation processes in higher eukaryotes. Modifications of cytosine, in particular 5-methylcytosine (5mdC), in DNA play a central role through impacting chromatin structure, repressing transposons, and regulating transcription. DNA methylation is actively installed by DNA methyltransferases and reversed through Tet-dioxygenase-mediated oxidation of 5mdC to 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine (5hmdC), 5-formylcytosine (5fdC), and 5-carboxycytosine (5cadC). It is crucial to understand the role of these epigenetic DNA modifications in cellular differentiation and developmental processes, as well as in disease state mapping and tracing of 5mdC and its oxidized forms. In bisulfite sequencing, which has been the benchmark for mapping 5mdC for the last few decades, degradation of the majority of genetic material occurs through harsh chemical treatment. Alternative sequencing methods often utilize Tet-enzyme-mediated oxidation of 5mdC to locate 5mdC and 5hmdC in genomic DNA. Herein, we report the development of novel Tet3-variants for oxidation-based bisulfite-free 5mdC- sequencing.">

        <tr id="Objectives/Goals: Large-scale tumor sequencing efforts have led to annotations of novel cancer hotspot mutations that may underlie driver or cooperative function. We have sought to define the molecular consequences of such hotspots associated with pediatric DICER1 syndrome cancers, with the ultimate goal of revealing novel targets that may inform new standards of care. Methods/Study Population: We have performed genomic analysis to identify tumor types (in TCGA and MSK-IMPACT patient data) for which mutations in the Dicer1 gene (encoding Dicer protein) emerge as the dominant signature of driver function. As Dicer is a critical RNA processing factor responsible for the generation of microRNAs, which are posttranscriptional gene regulatory molecules, we have modeled these mutations in human embryonic stem cells in order to study the direct effects on miRNAs and their target genes in an isogenic background. In addition to providing the required setting for unambiguous attribution of function to specific mutations, clonal human ES cells offer an opportunity for modeling of both developmental and cancer requirements associated with altered Dicer function. Results/Anticipated Results: Through generation of genomics and functional datasets from matched genotypes in Dicer mutated human ES cells, we have identified specific alterations in miRNAs and their effects on target genes. Unexpectedly, we found direct evidence for both loss of function and gain of function attributable to Dicer mutations. In addition, through integrated analysis of genomic data from tumor sequencing datasets and our human ES cell models, we have identified potential miRNA and target gene alterations that underlie tumorigenic potential, nominating gene candidates for targeted therapy in DICER1 syndrome. Direct mouse modeling of such candidate gene targets has revealed evidence for driver function of identified miRNA and their targets. Discussion/Significance of Impact: DICER1 syndrome cancers comprise a wide variety of rare pediatric tumor types. Presently, we still lack an effective standard of care. Furthermore, the previous lack of molecular profiling precluded targeted therapy opportunities. Our precise knock-in modeling of Dicer hotspots and deep profiling of relevant tumors now provide candidate targets.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Epigenetics and epigenomics are captivating fields of molecular biology, dedicated to the exploration of heritable alterations in gene expression and cellular phenotypes, which transpire devoid of any discernible modifications to the fundamental DNA sequence. This intricate regulatory apparatus encompasses multiple mechanisms, prominently featuring DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the involvement of non-coding RNA molecules in pivotal roles. To achieve a comprehensive grasp of these diverse mechanisms, it is imperative to conduct research employing animal models as proxies for human studies. Since experimental animal models like mice and rats struggle to replicate the diverse environmental conditions experienced by humans, this review focuses on comparing common epigenetic alterations in naturally occurring tumors in canine models, which share the human environment, with those in humans. Through this, we emphasize the importance of an epigenetic regulation in the comparative medical approach to a deeper understanding of cancers and further development of cancer treatments. Additionally, we elucidate epigenetic modifications pertinent to specific developmental stages, the ageing process, and the progression of various diseases.">

        <tr id="It has become clear that not only multiple molecular mechanisms, both intrinsic and extrinsic, but also numerous metabolites converge to alter core cellular metabolism during tumorigenesis. This state of affairs has made it difficult to analyse precisely the roles that key metabolites play in immune cell functions and/or cancer. Fortuitously, the finding that certain mutations in particular metabolic enzymes, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase, can give rise to malignancies such as gliomas, acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) give us avenues to comprehending metabolic and epigenetic pathways that are important in both in tumorigenesis and immune responses. Another metabolite that plays an important linking role between a seemingly unconnected biological process and immunity is acetylcholine. Although choline has been known for decades to be involved in neurotransmission, its deficiency has been shown to cause liver cancer. Our laboratory has reported several findings supporting the intriguing proposition that neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and acetylcholine may be key components that tie the neuronal system to the regulation of immune responses. In this presentation, I will discuss our findings dissecting the roles of important metabolic elements and neurotransmitters in immune cell regulation and diseases such as infections, autoimmune diseases and cancer development.

        <tr id="Gene fusions are one of the most important molecular biomarkers for tumor diagnosis, classification and targeted therapy. How to accurately detect them is a key issue in clinical work. In this study, a custom-designed integration of DNA and RNA-based next generation sequencing (NGS) assay including 16 targeted therapy related genes was developed and validated to identify gene fusions in solid tumors. This assay accurately identified all 10 different types of fusion in 8 commercial fusion spiked-in reference standards and 29 fusions including 16 different fusion forms in 60 clinical solid tumor samples previously identified by clinical testing methods. In addition, a TPM3::NTRK1 fusion was additionally identified and validated by Sanger sequencing, which showed a false-negative result for the previous result. Mutational abundance limit of detection for the assay was assessed with a series of dilution experiments. These fusions can be stably detected when the mutational abundance is down to 5% for DNA and 250–400 copies/100 ng for RNA. The intra-assay and inter-assay reproducibility was observed in three samples and three replicates. This integration of DNA and RNA-based NGS assay shows excellent performance on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, results at different levels can complement each other, thereby facilitating precise diagnosis and treatment.
